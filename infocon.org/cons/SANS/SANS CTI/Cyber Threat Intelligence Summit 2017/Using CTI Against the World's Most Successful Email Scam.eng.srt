4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,100
started I wanted to share with you all

5
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:16,870
the life of a speaker and what it's like

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,520
to speak at the CTI summit this year in

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,470
particular and I'm gonna start off in

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,700
August 13th when I got accepted to speak

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,840

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,700
excitement that it has like I'm gonna

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,250
bring this information and then

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,780
recalling tweets in November guess who

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,210
the keynote is Cristal and I'm like

14
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,579

I got a lot to live up to here there's a

16
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:36,850
lot going on and then the schedule came

17
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,900
out and I was like okay I can do this I

18
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,160
can handle this and the schedule came

19
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,660
out and then I found out hey Matt we're

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,970
gonna put you in between the sugar and

21
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,370
warming seats for Ronnie and Ronnie's

22
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,899

23
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,760
happy to be here and get you all amped

24
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:51,399
up and pumped up for Ronnie's talk but

25
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,019
hopefully in between now and then we'll

26
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,180
we'll have some fun talking about email

27
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,350
scams all right so here's an agenda I'm

28
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,340
not gonna ask you to read through it I'm

29
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,840
not gonna read it to you because we're

30
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,629
actually to go through it live straight

31
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,250
Bill O'Reilly style so first and

32
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,809
foremost this is the most boring slide

33
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,399
in the entire deck by the way my name is

34
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,170

36
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,530
from this area could not be happier to

37
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:15,880
have left it especially now I work at a

38
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,159

39
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,020
of Kroll before I mentioned it all right

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,100
a few okay who here heard of coal when

41
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,499
they looked me up on LinkedIn right

42
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,178

now I'm a huge foodie I can't live in a

51
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:42,880
barbecue state and not enjoy the food

52
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:44,469
that we've got there I'm however being

53
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,089
from this area I got a hankering for

54
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,678
crab cakes every now and then and then

55
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,880
really I'm one of those I don't work a

56
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:51,579
day in my life because I love what I do

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,889
said most boring slide all right let's

60
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,429
move on to the fun stuff why does this

61
00:01:56,889 --> 00:02:00,189
matter

62
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:02,200
I have to apologize I don't have any

63
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:05,139
fancy bears to throw your way I'm not

00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:12,040
here to talk to you about emails

66
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,569
exciting right emails and then cliff

67
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,730
shows up and I'm like I really need to

68
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,530
find a way to make this exciting all

69
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,179
right let's start in January 2015 I

70
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,200
apologize for the size on this we had a

71
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,239
little bit of a sizing issue but that's

72
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,829
okay I can read it to you January 2015

73
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,379
we had an alert from the FBI that came

74
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,510
out that in about 14 months 214 million

75
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:32,440
dollars was stolen because of this scam

76
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,660
fast forward to August a whopping seven

77
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,489
months we're now up to half a billion

78
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,220
five hundred eighty five million dollars

79
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,810
stolen about eighty one hundred victims

80
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,590
let's go even further now we're in April

81
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,260
2016 and are up our amount is up to 1.5

82
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,079
billion dollars stolen since October

83
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,060
2013 and then last but not least in June

84
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:54,220
2016 we got another alert from the FBI

85
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,519
we're now up to three point 1 billion

86
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,840
dollars stolen via this scam between

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,950
October 2013 and June 2016

88
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,560
pandas may be cool you know what's work

89
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:10,149
or than a panda 3 point 1 billion

90
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,379
dollars definitely cooler 3.1 billion as

91
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,590
of June 2016

92
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:17,950
daily average of 3.1 million dollars

93
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,209
anyone here making that daily if so I'm

94
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,980
hanging up this microphone and we're

95
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,829
gonna go have a chat most successful

96
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,168
month was 400 million dollars in one

97
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,599
month ransomware sounds kind of cool

98
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,709
that's alright state-sponsored attackers

99
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,440
interesting

100
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,599
I'll go escape with 3.1 billion dollars

101
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,859
off to the side if I can who here thinks

102
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,590
this is probably the most sophisticated

103
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,480
attack they've ever seen as well a

104
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,269
little preview of what's gonna happen

105
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,410
right 3.1 billion dollars I mean does

106
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,359
anyone here looked at the list of

107
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,700
non-extradition countries lately there's

108
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:52,510
a few island nations on there just

109
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,470
saying just saying alright let's talk a

110
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,090
little bit about what these business

111
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,040
email scams actually are hopefully this

112
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,380
is going to seem fairly familiar because

113
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,690
you folks have read on it and I know

114
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,000
don't deny it for some of you it's going

115
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,620
to seem intimately familiar because you

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,269
had to deal with it inside of your

117
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,970
organization I already see one head

118
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:12,579
nodding like yes that was me I had to

119
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,139
deal with this it's not fun few key

120
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,228
ingredients you're gonna see like this

121
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,579
sounds a lot like fishing Matt okay key

122
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,329
ingredients I need a smaller kind of

123
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,750
business

124
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,210
we not see so much of a small business

125
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,520
as opposed to medium to businesses that

126
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,989
operate in the millions that doesn't

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,688
mean big businesses don't get hit though

128
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,729
your fortune companies do get hit with

129
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,439
this as well can anyone think of two why

130
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,780
I'm going after kind of that middle tier

131
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,219
I'm not going after mom-and-pop one-stop

132
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,489
grocery shops I want the people who do

133
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:44,800
maybe 1015 million in revenue a year one

134
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:49,479
of my big banks have in place very good

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,039
for our detection what's that exactly

136
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,780
they're used to the amounts that I want

137
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,310
to steal I don't want to steal 3.1

138
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,219
billion at a time because someone's

139
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,050
gonna come after me anyone remember that

140
00:04:56,219 --> 00:05:00,849
that um Swift tack that we had where

141
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,080
they were poised to steal billions and

142
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,060
billions of dollars how did that work

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,128
out for them not very well right one

144
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,620
little typo and you lose yourself a

145
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:10,030
bunch of billions of dollars in this

146
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,979
case though we're just gonna chip away I

147
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,359
also need an incorrect domain we're

148
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,729
gonna talk about that in just a second I

149
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,090
need a CEO name and a CFO name those are

150
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:20,258
hard to come by right really tough to

151
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,878
come by those ones and then I need some

152
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,830
random person in the county who doesn't

153
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,210
want to piss the boss off really

154
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,150
straightforward my last three bullets

155
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,479
where can I get those from yeah I mean

156
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,090
Google maybe maybe this stuff is being

157
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,229
indexed and stored somewhere maybe my

158
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,239
business has accessed this kind of

159
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:39,008
information so that's all I need

160
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,389
like I said non-extradition countries

161
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,680
there's some really nice ones out there

162
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,229
we've got all the ingredients let's make

163
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,750
some soup all right you've got two

164
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:50,050
seconds what do we got on here anyone

165
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,289
tell me are these the same someone shout

166
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,289
it out

167
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,789
what's that I heard I heard lowercase L

168
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,580
it looks like there's a space in between

169
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:02,930
the the the m the I and the C right you

170
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,058
guys agree there's a space there

171
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,120
sorry loaded answer it's actually a one

172
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:10,009
that was in there mmm really hard to

173
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,629
tell to be honest with you I flipped

174
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,069
through about 40 different fonts before

175
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:17,270
I found the one that made the image that

176
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:20,240
I wanted however its it the hype is real

177
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,219
this really happens this makes sense to

178
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,870
us in this room every person watching

179
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,159
this presentation says yeah of course

180
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,159
I'm looking out for this kind of stuff

181
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:30,860
ones instead of eyes or elles zeros

182
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,748
instead of o's so on and so forth it

183
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,370
makes sense extra letters letters for

184
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:36,740
numbers transpose anyone catch the

185
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,319
second line there whiskey versus Vova

186
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,370
iski that one likes to slip people up a

187
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,539
lot I like that one because you

188
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,529
especially those of you in the back it

189
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,810
just kind of blends together

190
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,599
and then another thing too is infos busy

191
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,580
owns all the different sites I have a

192
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,080
dot-com and a dotnet not or graduate for

193
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,998
my organization do I have the rest as

194
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,628
well if not I need to go see what's

195
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:57,009
going on with it

196
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:59,800
guess what these are not trained eyes

197
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,689
let's go back to this slide real quick

198
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,949
does anything on this list say InfoSec

199
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:08,899
IT admin CSO no this is a group of

200
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,099
people who we know do not know the

201
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,759
difference between these different types

202
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,620
of things how do we acquire these

203
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,449
different types of domains few resources

204
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,089
available first and foremost there's a

205
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,649
lot of companies that actually target

206
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,810
these types of businesses and they say

207
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,279

222
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,620
awesome blog post on that vistaprint we

223
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,020
can allow an account set up with not

224
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,669
even a charge took a card with a penny

225
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,389
on it and tried to use it to register

226
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,448
and it worked

227
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,440
one-month free trial all I need is one

228
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,720
month onion is one email

229
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,200
to get in and I can get it for free not

230
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,580
a bad entry vector the account set up

231
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,840
and this is my favorite part I used to

232
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,950
have like a little walkthrough on here

233
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,510
but we're not doing a live demo but

234
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,740
Vistaprint you actually used to be able

235
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,659
to set it up and they would give you a

236
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,180
free webmail account to go with your

237
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,650
domain so now I'm asking you how skilled

238
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,880
are my attackers right they register

239
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,229
this fake domain they get these

240
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,790
transpose letters they find a way to

241
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,800
fool you then they've got to set up this

242
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,300
this hidden email service right they've

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,070
got to be super smart at setting up

244
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,799
these things nope mr. print does it all

245
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,050
for him for free in 90% of cases

246
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,968
vistaprint is our purveyor for this

247
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,530
particular one and this is not a this is

248
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,909
not a jab at Vistaprint they actually

249
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,039
run a legitimate business they've got

250
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,390
great commercials I want 500 business

251
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,310
cards for free if I'm gonna start my

252
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,890
business definitely but I don't want

253
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,689
someone attacking me and coming after it

254
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,800
all right I'm gonna do a count in the

255
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,800
back of my head I don't ever want to

256
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,069
take a look at this email okay that was

257
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,780
8 seconds or give or take a few eight

258
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,130
seconds is the average time the human

259
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,959
being reads an email when it comes into

260
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:08,300
their inbox how many errors did we see

261
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,680
any one one which one

262
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,359
alright good catch the from address

263
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,979
we've got some transposing here did

264
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,620
anyone skip over that part and go right

265
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,820
to the subject or right to the body yeah

266
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,370
they didn't focus on that whatsoever

267
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,780
guess what everyone else does especially

268
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,570
in the accounting department there's an

269
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,980
email coming in from my CEO yeah I know

270
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,280
who my CEO is I'm gonna go right to the

271
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,560
subject part did anyone catch this one

272
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,689
Friday it four minutes to five I just

273
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,969
want to go home at that point believe me

274
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,090
this happens for a particular reason how

275
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,430
about this one anyone pick up on that

276
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,950
it's not an actual forward how easy is

277
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,750
it to fake a forward just take the text

278
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,640
from the email throw it into ASCII paste

279
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,050
it and you're done that's it that's what

280
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,310
a forward looks like I like that they

281
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,170
took the extra step here and actually

282
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,670
made links because then it looks a

283
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,490
little bit more legit as opposed to just

284
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,380
raw text and then last but not least we

285
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,280
got a PDF attachment as well any malware

286
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:06,060
in here doesn't look like it right mmm

287
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:08,130
any any princes Kings send me money I'll

288
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,199
do this no it looks like the CEO is

289
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,210
asking the CEO looks like Jim is asking

290
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,850
Jayne hey do me a favor

291
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,620
then why are some money to this vendor

292
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,139
and then gym passes it on to John and

293
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:25,170
says hey John do me a favor take care of

294
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:27,180
this for me I'm busy there we go there's

295
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,380
another catch as well we don't focus in

296
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,819
on that one but Mike is definitely right

297
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,519
there's other things here that should

298
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:34,829
trip us again a roomful of trained eyes

299
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,170
not a room full of accountants who at

300
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:38,819
5:00 to 5:00 on a Friday just want to go

301
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,329
home important takeaway good catch

302
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,860
though all right so now we know a little

303
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,060
bit about what this scam looks like what

304
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,769
this attack actually looks like let's

305
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,849
talk let's define this campaign let's

306
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,500
build this out let's have some threat

307
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,589
Intel fun I think that's what we're here

308
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,060
for so we have some indicators right we

309
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,970
have a transpose domain could I do

310
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,500
anything with that domain any thoughts

311
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,060
I could write I'd go buy a million

312
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,380
dollar-a-year threat Intel service and I

313
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,550
could pump that domain through those

314
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,170
indicators and see what comes back

315
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,349
definitely where am I going to get

316
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:10,290
registered at Vistaprint three days ago

317
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:13,980
next doesn't do much for me how about a

318
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,120
PDF any use in a PDF it's not malicious

319
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,440
right we already talked about this

320
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,649
there's no malware inside it's just a

321
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,380
text document yes there are we have a

322
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,610
title in md5 anything out of those hmm

323
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,680
no not really

324
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,410
fairly arbitrary change a bit you can

325
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,209
change one how about machine information

326
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,709
now I'm starting to understand a little

327
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:33,660
bit of the person who created this PDF

328
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:36,149
what version they use how they wrote it

329
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,560
did they export from word did they

330
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,370
export from Google Chrome

331
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,579
did they have use Adobe Acrobat

332
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:46,889
timestamps what a time Sam's tell me my

333
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,138
domain was registered then my PDF was

334
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,779
created then it was sent then and then

335
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,370
it was money was sent out now tells me

336
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,709
how quickly my attackers are actually

337
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,970
mounting and building this campaign if I

338
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,040
have an attacker who did all of those

339
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,660
steps within four minutes of each other

340
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,269
what does that tell you about the recon

341
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,160
phase of this attack it is definitely

342
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,720
happening way beforehand and the author

343
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,880
author is the important part I'm gonna

344
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,860
focus on who here actually I know the

345
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,600
answer but I'm gonna ask anyways who

346
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,009
here when they publish a document uses

347
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,980
office inspector to clear out all

348
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,000
metadata from the document everyone

349
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,620
right I know you guys doesn't want to

350
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,269
raise your hand sugar rush and whatnot

351
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,069
from brownies and cookies that's okay I

352
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:24,190
know everyone does but unfortunately

353
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:25,719
I've at guys don't

354
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,030
and then bank info we'll talk about

355
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,920
banking phone a little bit let's start

356
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,280
with our PDF metadata we got an author

357
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,610
here he goes by the name boss laud B OSS

358
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,620
LOD well I wonder if boss lot has

359
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,930
written any other documents anyone here

360
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,550
familiar with Mal war.com take away the

361
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,880
last two valves right malware come what

362
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,199
is malware com the cuckoo sandbox lying

363
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,870
upload your stuff and see what's bad

364
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,820
what do we teach all of our people to do

365
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,220
if you think it's bad don't click it if

366
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,990
you think it's a bad document upload it

367
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,700
and check it look to see if it has

368
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,960
viruses inside guess what the average

369
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,400
accountant does they upload this

370
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,320
document it comes back with a zero score

371
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,199
and they say oh this isn't malware I can

372
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,970
do what it says how did a letter not

373
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,610
being malicious turn into you can follow

374
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,110
the instructions inside that's a common

375
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,460
problem that we see between there so

376
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,230
let's do a little search and see if boss

377
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,270
lot is written anything else it's been

378
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,740
uploaded to a source by the way I just

379
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,449
focus on malware for this discussion

380
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,770
there's a lot of other open source and

381
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,480
I'm calling them open source

382
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,130
intelligence sources but quite frankly

383
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,250
it's not really what it is we're just

384
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:30,670
using it for that 17 different results

385
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,620
came back so boss laud it looks like he

386
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,729
has written 17 different documents I'm

387
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,290
gonna go through and take a look and see

388
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,000
how many of these we actually have how

389
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,560
many are actually authored by boss laud

390
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,270
how many people wrote a document just

391
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,770
through the term boss lot inside I don't

392
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,329
know what boss a lot means I don't know

393
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,780
what it is I'll know what it does but I

394
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,100
know some guy like 2 likes to go by it

395
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,730
we start to profile this what looks

396
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,040
familiar here yeah I think boss law it

397
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,200
has a pretty static document naming

398
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,800
convention that he uses when he sends

399
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,140
these out

400
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,969
RNR engraving oriental wiring they all

401
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,470
finish with wiring instructions what's

402
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,990
the problem with following this as an

403
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,510
indicator though remember that what's

404
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,150
that it's gonna change this is a user

405
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,230
uploaded document the user may rename it

406
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,610
to whatever they want so we've got to be

407
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,070
a little bit careful with this luckily a

408
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,720
lot of our users stuck with the former

409
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,580
name and uploaded it that way so now I

410
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,050
can start to profile well let's take it

411
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,610
a step further I filtered on what boss

412
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,319
law does but now I know that they also

413
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,089
like to name their documents the same as

414
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,990
well let's do a search for wiring

415
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:28,120
instructions

416
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,770
we're on Google search number two we've

417
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,600
worked for about three seconds at this

418
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,920
point we'll bill a couple hours because

419
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,630
that's what we do as consultants but you

420
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,910
know well it's a three second Google

421
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,890
search

422
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,150
fifty-five results now I have to put in

423
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,069
a disclaimer here this is going to get

424
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,689
very distracting very quickly for the

425
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,520
sole purpose of the term wiring

426
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,200
instructions does not mean it's related

427
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,120
to this campaign so we have to do a

428
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,400
little bit of digging so we did a little

429
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,520
bit of digging in fact I did about three

430
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,640
minutes of digging for you three minutes

431
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,430
and here's what we came out with sixteen

432
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,590
different authors 29 different documents

433
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,849
nine different banks in about three

434
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,740
minutes of searching and just hopping

435
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,000
from term to term to term to term now

436
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,800
again we haven't discussed how much

437
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,210
money each thing brings in because I

438
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,510
don't have that content but all I have

439
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,730
is how prolific is this campaign or is

440
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,900
it a one-stop shop is it a lot of

441
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,150
different folks out there

442
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,430
what's my chokehold here what's my choke

443
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,740
point yeah

444
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,390
thanks we'll come back to that in just a

445
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,230
moment but I'm looking at this and I'm

446
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,210
like okay I got a lot of different

447
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,850
authors problem with an author I can

448
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,260
change that field we found a few

449
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,170
different authors we found folks like

450
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,490
Compaq Houdini again our our friend boss

451
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:40,569
Claude does make an appearance in there

452
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,240
as well ray kills Kovas mu Rizwan Khalid

453
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,850
this is a fun looking gang I want to

454
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,670
hang out with these guys where hey kills

455
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,340
do me a favor put together that the that

456
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,560
that's that phishing campaign and let's

457
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,030
send that off to ABC industries if you

458
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,500
want so some really interesting names we

459
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,900
had a couple of empty documents as well

460
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,950
maybe they got smart think about what

461
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,170
you're talking about when you see an

462
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,790
attacker drop their author name into a

463
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,680
PDF document and then all of a sudden

464
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,089
they don't - six months down the line

465
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,839
maybe they're learning a little bit

466
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,640
maybe they're getting a little more

467
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,380
intelligent maybe they got a brand-new

468
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,910
computer they don't know how to use it

469
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,800
we actually saw a couple of these

470
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,060
authors move from Windows to Mac's and

471
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,270
they very clearly did not know how to

472
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,280
use a Mac what banks did they like to

473
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,130
use banks were all familiar with for the

474
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,540
most part right HSBC Bank of America TD

475
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,130
Canada I've never heard of China

476
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,890
Construction Bank I have a sneaky

477
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,689
suspicion as to what they do but you

478
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,850
know things I haven't heard of before

479
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,350
Texas Bank that one hit kind of hard

480
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,990
when I found that one I was like come on

481
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,910
stay out of my state go away and then

482
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,110
Citizens Bank as well again none of

483
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,610
these right off the bat they're not

484
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,990
legitimate banks these are legitimate

485
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,360
banks that they're using to launder

486
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,790
money through

487
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,649
some banks may only own leaves once I'll

488
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,509
go back real quick you'll see like HSBC

489
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,339
hang sang in Bank of America get quite a

490
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,689
few mentions they like to use those they

491
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,249
like to funnel this money through Hong

492
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:58,199
Kong that's a big one because it's very

493
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,480
easy to set up an account hire someone

494
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,679
to go pull it out for you but sometimes

495
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,449
they got to stay stateside

496
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,019
as well sometimes we'll see things like

497
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:09,089
HSBC China Citibank International

498
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,529
Limited which I think just really really

499
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:12,089
wanted to be an official name and

500
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:15,269
through as many adjectives as they could

501
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:17,010
in there JPMorgan Chase first trade so

502
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:19,888
on and so forth so we're starting to see

503
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,500
not only the banks that they commonly

504
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:23,819
use but then we start to also profile

505
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,109
why do they step out of their comfort

506
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,908
zone if Rizwan Khalid is very familiar

507
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,918
with the process of setting up and

508
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:33,600
stealing money through an HSBC account

509
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,120
why does Rizwan Khalid all of a sudden

510
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,320
move to using Bank of America why does

511
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,090
he move to using some of these other

512
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,250
more local banks that I may not be too

513
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,019
familiar with did they get caught are

514
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,940
they starting to get you know people

515
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,440
starting to understand the campaign are

516
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,000
they not getting money if they use one

517
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,799
bank so now we're starting to understand

518
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,110
a little bit more about how they start

519
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,668
to progress through the different banks

520
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,019
that they use my attacker is getting

521
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:56,220
smarter are they learning more or

522
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,100
there's some banks that are that are

523
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,450
more vulnerable to this type of scam so

524
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,010
we profiled these attackers out we've

525
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,250
identified some banks seems like fun

526
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,750
stuff we've talked about some of the

527
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,399
data that they sorry we've talked about

528
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,539
some of the accounts that they use we've

529
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:10,799
talked about their usernames we've

530
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,929
looked at the different banks that they

531
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,418
do banking out of we've got a lot of

532
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:17,309
indicators here we started with one PDF

533
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,320
that had nothing inside of it whatsoever

534
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,418
it was fairly benign and we extrapolated

535
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,470
that into a campaign with a lot of

536
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,720
different things and that was in three

537
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,909
minutes of searching I promise you all I

538
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,929
do not want to convolute this slide but

539
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:29,760
the research i've done over the past

540
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,830
three years this thing is hundreds and

541
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,539
hundreds of nodes wide it goes out there

542
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,189
3.1 billion dollars ain't easy to come

543
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,809
by you got to do a lot of work for that

544
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,399
one but let's focus on the more

545
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,039
important part in the big takeaway from

546
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:43,260
this talk we started with one PDF we

547
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,080
branched out to all of this now everyone

548
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,879
wants to know how do we get better how

549
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,620
does an attack that stole 3.1 billion

550
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,809
dollars from us over the past 60 or

551
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,949
sorry us four years how do we start to

552
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:57,790
get better and defend against this

553
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,670
anyone recognize this maybe I think Mike

554
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:03,850
recognizes it just a little bit here as

555
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,800
threat Intel we're meant to use models

556
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,300
such as this this is not the only model

557
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,100
but we're UNT use models like this and

558
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,350
fill in these blanks right how do my

559
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,909
attackers recon my environment how do

560
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,980
they weaponize how do they deliver how

561
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,630
do they exploit how do they then achieve

562
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,520
their objective and steal money from my

563
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,010
environment what happens when my

564
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,980
attacker starts to wreak on one - skips

565
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,390
a few and just steals money out the door

566
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,800
there's no malware dropped there's no

567
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,050
Account privilege there's a lateral

568
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,300
movement there's no zero days there's no

569
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,800
fancy meterpreter shells they literally

570
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,050
sent one email and walked out of the

571
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,510
door with $200,000 for and $1000

572
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:40,480
$700,000 how do we get better how do I

573
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:43,240
defend against this let's look at our

574
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,160
evidence we had a PDF fairly benign PDF

575
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,140
just a bunch of text inside help me out

576
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,440
here because I really want to know is

577
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,810
this gonna defend it's an internal email

578
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,730
right what am I gonna do block email

579
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,280
anyone tried to block email in the

580
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,050
firewall before if anyone wants it you

581
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,490
could try right now it's gonna be

582
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,830
interesting we'll watch you run out with

583
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:06,250
your hair on fire how about this that's

584
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,600
gonna help we're actually focusing a

585
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,820
little bit how about this AV helps right

586
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,740
maybe he's gonna catch everything that

587
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,060
was a really big wolf from I'm assuming

588
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,450
someone who works with an AV vendor over

589
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,520
their heads hips he's gonna help nudes

590
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,140
nips how about this email prevention is

591
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,300
gonna help right we're gonna detonate

592
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,220
that PDF inside of a sandbox and then

593
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,649
pull out its indicators and block it all

594
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,910
going forward what indicators well

595
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,490
you're gonna launch a company that

596
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:33,460
operates off of the author field of a

597
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,230
PDF not gonna work really well this is

598
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,410
why this attack is so dangerous because

599
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,810
as InfoSec folks as CTI folks as

600
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,490
responders we rely on these things to

601
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,440
tell us when something doesn't fit right

602
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,790
in our environment and now all of a

603
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,080
sudden there's an attacker who's found a

604
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,180
way to circumvent all the things that

605
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,649
don't fit right we're gonna talk about

606
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,380
where they're attacking in just a moment

607
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,640
as well alright so we're gonna come back

608
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,190
to our kill chain here and once again

609
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,350
I'm gonna ask you as a as CTI folks as

610
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,510
incident responders how do we deal with

611
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,250
an attacker who just says forget the

612
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,440
middle steps I'm gonna go right to the

613
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,710
end how do we deal with this particular

614
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,000
type of attacker well

615
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,880
some folks may say focus on the

616
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,210
reconnaissance not a bad idea tell you

617
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,010
what we're gonna set up some LinkedIn

618
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,630
visitations scraping scripts and every

619
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,760
hour we're gonna scrape LinkedIn and see

620
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,539
who's visited our site are we able to

621
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,700
actually do that

622
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,990
no but yet it's all public and tell you

623
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,460
what then you've also got to scrape your

624
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,049
financial statements you got to see

625
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,520
who's scraping every article that's ever

626
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:29,658
been written about you okay alright

627
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,450
recons not gonna work

628
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:34,340
got it make sense how about our actions

629
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,440
on objectives let's focus here and this

630
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,299
is where I'm going to challenge my

631
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,279
threat Intel folks to think about what

632
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:42,320
this means usually as an incident

633
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,299
responder this is where you're at hole

634
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,240
crap we're gonna need to shut something

635
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,889
down things have burned for CTI I'm

636
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,570
gonna ask you to say how does this turn

637
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,850
into an opportunity for me how does this

638
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,200
turn into an opportunity for my business

639
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,178
let's take a look and see how this goes

640
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,399
what happens in this particular phase of

641
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:01,010
this attacker life cycle of this cyber

642
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:02,658
kill chain an employee gets an email the

643
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,740
employee initiates the transfer and then

644
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:05,809
money goes out the door that's right

645
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,789
three steps really simple how do I

646
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,990
defend against this how do I protect

647
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,370
against an employee doing this some of

648
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,010
they look at this and say this is futile

649
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,719
there's nothing I can do or my favorite

650
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,390
statement which I'm going to ask

651
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,419
everyone to never say again this stupid

652
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,279
user clicked on stupid XYZ ABC and then

653
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:23,870
stupid event happened and I'm going to

654
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:26,120
ask you not to ever say that again

655
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,189
because your job is to protect the

656
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,840
organization and if you think that by

657
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,100
sitting back and reading feeds every day

658
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,510
you're gonna do that no we've got to

659
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,428
expand our branches take a look at this

660
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,779
here three different steps right money

661
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:39,049
walking out the door do you see info

662
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:41,299
second there no definitely doesn't cross

663
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,950
the IT admin do you see anything that is

664
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,120
going to involve anyone in this room not

665
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,320
necessarily but I'm gonna tell you this

666
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,840
is where you can get involved number one

667
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,100
you do have a choke point you do have a

668
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,928
choke point in this process where you

669
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,120
can ask and talk to your accounting

670
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:54,830
department and say ask yourself when

671
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,870
transfers come through is this normally

672
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,908
how I receive requests we're a

673
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,770
multi-million dollar business do you

674
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:03,140
normally get transfer requests in a

675
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,418
forward from the CFO to the CEO or the

676
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,250
CEO to the CFO that says hey sorry I'm

677
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:09,919
golfing can you send this out real quick

678
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,570
I forgot to tell you about that $400,000

679
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,940
payment we're making to hang seng Bank

680
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,189

681
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,840
from I've met a lot of CEOs and satin a

682
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,520
lot of boardrooms in my time very rarely

683
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,760
am I am i interrupting a discussion

684
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,190
where the CEO is like hey Jen did you

685
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,540
send those invoices out um I just just

686
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,220
want to make sure that the accounting is

687
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,899
on top of things you may have a super

688
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,350
micromanaging CEO in that particular

689
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,820
case

690
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,189
very rarely though is this coming from

691
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,689
them here's my other choke point as well

692
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,010
this is where I'm gonna work with my

693
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,440
accounting department say do we normally

694
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,300

695
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,890

696
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,690
million dollars a year in revenue let's

697
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,130
say an email comes through hey do me a

698
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,790
favor send half a million over to hang

699
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,560
seng bank in China what I don't do

700
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,010
business with you I don't know who you

701
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,629
are

702
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,510
the best thing that can ever come out of

703
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,340
these types of attacks is ask someone

704
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,110
what happened here this doesn't make

705
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,520
sense and then set up a do not transfer

706
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,689
list we already went through a list of

707
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,700
banks that need to go through we went

708
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,650
through a list of banks that we are know

709
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,180
our attackers are going after guess what

710
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm doing if I work in threat Intel and

711
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,270
I've seen this campaign I'm going to my

712
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,950
accounting department and I'm saying hey

713
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,750
here's a list of ten banks we do

714
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,760
business with these banks know okay good

715
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,410
in the future if we ever do I need dual

716
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,390
signatures and I need to be notified of

717
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,220
that request comes through because my

718
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,690
job is to protect this organization and

719
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,870
I don't want to sit back and watch you

720
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,520
send bulks on the money to HSBC and then

721
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,409
all of a sudden the security department

722
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,840
which already has ridiculously low

723
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,220
funding gets an even bigger cut because

724
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,760
the county needs more money to make up

725
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,710
for their mishap realize where your

726
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,060
frontlines are again I'm gonna go back

727
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,980
here and tell you all that all of these

728
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,500
choke points this is your accounting

729
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,030
department how many people here think

730
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,620
about their accounting or their account

731
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,590
or their marketing departments as their

732
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,060
frontline right once the malware gets in

733
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,470
the system I'm gonna find it somehow

734
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,570
right I'm gonna detect that lateral

735
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,980
movement I'm gonna find those shells why

736
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,439
don't I go back to the frontline and say

737
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,880
hey stop clicking on stuff don't open

738
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,890
things and and that you want to talk

739
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,940
about an exercise in futility ask your

740
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,710
marketing department it cut stop

741
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,700
clicking on things it's a very very

742
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,980
tough thing to go through but I'm gonna

743
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,360
say at this point guess what if you have

744
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,470
a go go have a discussion with your

745
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,030
accounting department and you stop a

746
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,680
million two million dollars from walking

747
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,820
out the door

748
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,560
there's brownie points and then there's

749
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,149
what you just got inside the

750
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,100
organization I'm telling you it's a next

751
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,990
level of stuff so think about where your

752
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,610
front lines actually are if you fit into

753
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,799
this type

754
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,449
business that is most likely gonna get

755
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,690
targeted for these if you have a

756
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,580
department with not very strong InfoSec

757
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,140
around the accounting if you fit into

758
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,850
one of those we don't have a really big

759
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,160
fraud detection mechanism but we do

760
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,270
transfer millions of dollars a year then

761
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,410
you need to be thinking about what your

762
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,570
different front lines are and once you

763
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,160
identify those armed them with

764
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,110
everything they need to be successful

765
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,900
hey accounting department here's a list

766
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,820
of ten banks we never work with do not

767
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,530
send money here put on a post-it note

768
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,540
put in a little Excel table print it out

769
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,850
put it all inside their cubicles boom

770
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,080
guess what like I said you just stopped

771
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,000
a bunch of million dollars from walking

772
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,918
out the door notice we haven't talked

773
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,679
about any sort of animal whatsoever

774
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,049
thank you all right for the business

775
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,059
take this document to them hey

776
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:13,980
accounting is this what this looks like

777
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,918
this is what a normal wire transfer

778
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,679
comes in as someone's half-ass attempt

779
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,690
at drawing up details inside of a Word

780
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,309
document than converting a PDF do we

781
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,690
work with them does it match our details

782
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:27,000
does this vendor information look

783
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,320
familiar the best way to stop this is to

784
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,150
ask our accounting department to stop

785
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,549
and think again looking to get about

786
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,230
where our front lines are sharing is

787
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,429
caring as well and this is where I'm

788
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,330
gonna tell you all right now if this is

789
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,679
the first time you're hearing out

790
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,990
business email scams we're in trouble

791
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,820
because something that steals 400

792
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,750
million dollars a month should not be

793
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,860
news to us by now it should be a big

794
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,929
event that we're aware of

795
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,610
CREB should not be your IDs it's this

796
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:52,470
ridiculous meme I see thrown around the

797
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:57,020
internet Krebs as my IDs that is the

798
00:26:52,470 --> 00:27:00,600
worst IDs you can have is a journalist

799
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,799
publishing your data breach trust me you

800
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,899
do not want to be in that particular

801
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,520
state admitting to being fish is not

802
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,960
embarrassing trust me we are all being

803
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,270
fished right now in one way shape or

804
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,830
form it's okay to admit increases in

805
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,840
decreases and it's okay to share those

806
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,909
indicators take that list of banks and

807
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,590
share it with your competitors there's

808
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,750
nothing wrong with sharing and admitting

809
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,840
to what's going on here don't use this

810
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,040
as a leg up and I'm gonna take it in a

811
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,270
couple minutes and just focus on this

812
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,830
and luckily this has actually already

813
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,030
been said today so I get to kind of lean

814
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,590
and stand on the shoulders of giants

815
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,668
everyone in this room already has three

816
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,470
thread Intel source you all know that

817
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:34,990
right yes what is it

818
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,090
your own environment everyone here is

819
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,289
your own threat Intel spunk folks did a

820
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,908
much better job of summing it up so I'm

821
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,320
just gonna leave it at that if you're

822
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,090
protecting an organization and you're

823
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,379
not keeping notes about the things going

824
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,320
on in your environment there's something

825
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,030
wrong with what you're doing we get

826
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,950
better by learning cumulatively not

827
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,539
resetting the clock every day and I know

828
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,860
this crowd is not doing this but I'm

829
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:56,129
gonna say it just in case someone's

830
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,178
looking for that branch to grab onto

831
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,909
tracking your own threat Intel can be an

832
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:02,950
easy start don't fall into the trap of

833
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:04,299
I'm a small medium-sized business I'm

834
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,070
already having enough time trying to

835
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:08,530
keep unpatched Java an unpatched flash

836
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,600
in check start with notepad no plus plus

837
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,820
record your indicators again this is not

838
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,289
a sophisticated campaign I'm not asking

839
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,629
you to buy any sort of expensive feed to

840
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:17,980
protect against emails include enough

841
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,270
information that if you read this again

842
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,850
in the future you would remember the

843
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,530
event fully who here has ever said to

844
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,230
themselves I will definitely remember

845
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:28,570
that in fact I'm gonna give you a bigger

846
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,940
challenge record enough notes that if it

847
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,990
happened in 1986 you can present on it

848
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,990
in 2017

849
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:44,740
level up your life use Excel we've

850
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,580
talked about Excel being the best

851
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,840
analyst tool who's mind here just went

852
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,159
that's right this entire campaign

853
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,870
everything I talked about today was

854
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,580
recorded in Excel I know there was no

855
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,870
fancy thing behind it it allows you to

856
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,669
maintain relational data but more

857
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,649
importantly it lets you as a human do

858
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,080
what you're best at I am NOT the best at

859
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,880
reciting md5 s not the best at reciting

860
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,199
file names I am the best in taking a

861
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,430
split second look at that document and

862
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,410
saying HM there's a lot going on in

863
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,980
Queens Road in Hong Kong that's what I'm

864
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,150
good at

865
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,040
so put the information in a way that I

866
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,780
can look at it or if worse comes to

867
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,559
absolute worst and you can't stand Excel

868
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,450
but you need something a little more

869
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,920
powerful then use the tools that are out

870
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,540
there anyone here using any of these

871
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,070
threat note crits

872
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,510
miss these types of tools are out there

873
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,320
to help you track this information you

874
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,730
can do it for free

875
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,439
and if you say to me Matt I don't have

876
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,790
time to prop up a Linux server and do

877
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,900
this I'm gonna say guess what you have a

878
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:31,870
lot of time for a good learning

879
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,550
opportunity it does get better every one

880
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,780
we talked about colbus mu as one of our

881
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,520
attackers and I'm done after this I

882
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,670
promise everyone remember this name

883
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,629
colbus mu was tied to one particular

884
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,070
document that came through one

885
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,110
particular document that was uploaded on

886
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,419
malware mr. mu and I had quite a few

887
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,678
run-ins on an investigation side he's

888
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,000
actually responsible for quite a few

889
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,290
documents you may be wondering why am I

890
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,620
looking at this picture of colbus up

891
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,750
here

892
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,540
well colbus was pretty prolific and

893
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,580
active from 20 2013 up until 2015 and

894
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,450
then in August of 2015

895
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,550
he stopped anyone know why because of

896
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,500
everything that we do as threat Intel

897
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,149
sometimes here who feels like giving

898
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,880
information to law enforcement a one-way

899
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,910
road sometimes you do right guess what I

900
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,920
promise you it's not in August of 2015

901
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,360
Cove assume you got arrested for cases

902
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,610
that we investigated and accidentally

903
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,290
proved him as the author of these just

904
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,639
so happened to be in Dallas which was

905
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,399
really cool it was nice to do that

906
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,160
happen there but the takeaway from this

907
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,570
is all this work we do all this research

908
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,920
that we do and everything we go into

909
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,960
sometimes you don't see they'll the

910
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,520
silver line at the end but it's there I

911
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,990
promise you keep doing the good work

912
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,280
keep doing the research keep finding

913
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,840
these attackers we'll catch them

914
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,070
there's a good reference slide the

915
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,270
slides will obviously be available this

916
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,340
is all the different points I've talked

917
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,480
about for you to go through and I do

918
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,830
give Ronnie a shout out for his

919
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,390
presentation on vistaprint as well but

920
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,340
with that everyone thank you very much

921
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,520
for attending the presentation a lot of

922
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,520
fun

923
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,939
