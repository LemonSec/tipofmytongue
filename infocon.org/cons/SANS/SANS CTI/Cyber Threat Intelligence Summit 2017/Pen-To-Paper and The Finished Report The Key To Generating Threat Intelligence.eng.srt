00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,820
[Music]

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,420
when I started preparing for this

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,000
presentation one of the biggest

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,520
challenges I had was figuring out how to

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,720
do a good intro how do I introduce

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,370
writing which for a lot of people was

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,310
like kind of boring it seems like a

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,590
chore but after listening to the talks

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,779
yesterday I got a lot of good content to

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,539
work with so one of the first things

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,060
that cliff Stoll said was write it down

13
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,940
or it didn't happen and I was like yes

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,130
this is great perfect and then later in

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,879
the day Matt Bromley gave his talk and

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:46,360
on his slides the Ward said pen plus

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,120
paper like that's what I'm talking about

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,090
and then later in the evening we were at

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,800
the you know fo ski chalet drinking hot

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,260
chocolate with our pinky slightly

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,209
extended and one of the discussion

22
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,670
points was about documenting knowledge

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,940
and how important it is to put things on

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,530
paper so there's this motif at least for

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,689
me that I've seen emerged so far in the

26
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,909
conference and it's all about writing

27
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:12,279
and why it's so important to document

28
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,990
what we know and what we think so that's

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,299
what this talk is all about and that's

30
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,859
how I did this intro so let's get into

31
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,990
it here so Who am I

32
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:22,089
my name is Kristen Prentiss and I work

33
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,679
for Booz Allen Hamilton like many of you

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,149
first and foremost I'm a threat

35
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:28,359
intelligence analyst so I love doing

36
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:30,159
analysis but I also work with clients to

37
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,318
help them figure out how to design and

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,450
build and actually run their own threat

39
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,849
intelligence programs which means I

40
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,649
spend a lot of time thinking about what

41
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:40,689
makes a threat intelligence program good

42
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:43,929
what are those components that you need

43
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:46,928
to build in and of course when we all go

44
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:48,759
on that threat intelligence journey you

45
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,459
know the main goal the really the whole

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,200
point of intelligence is to get action

47
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,310
at the end and that's something that Rob

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
just mentioned you know we want to

49
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,599
affect change and we want to make

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,758
changes in our organization but when I

51
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,950
think about you know kind of at a very

52
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,889
high level this is my pseudo Intel cycle

53
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,470
how are we getting to action what I see

54
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:10,329
is a big gap between analysis in action

55
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,460
how are we tying those two things

56
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,599
together so let's let's walk through

57
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,239
this here

58
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,119
so consumption we all start as consumers

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,829
and consumption is tough right there's a

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,650
lot of data a lot of information out

61
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:25,870
there but I think we're doing ok because

62
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,670
there are tools to help us consume we

63
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,499
have a whole category of tools called

64
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,689
fret intelligence platforms they're

65
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:34,569
specifically designed to collect and

66
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:36,069
centralize data and if you've done your

67
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,439
threat intelligence homework you know

68
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,328
that requirements can help you scope

69
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,459
your collection and scope your

70
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,749
consumption because if you're collecting

71
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,180
something and it's not helping you

72
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:47,680
answer a question then it's probably not

73
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,870
worth the effort to collect so

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,829
consumption is tough but we're doing

75
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,540
better there so then next we get to

76
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,519
analysis and this is what we are all

77
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,159
awesome at you know this is the really

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,900
fun stuff whether it's like tearing

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,480
apart malware like ronnie was talking

80
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,919
about yesterday or maybe it's really

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,899
strategic level stuff like Lincoln

82
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,579
talked about or maybe you you know your

83
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,650
thing is pivoting through adversary

84
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,719
infrastructure on TLS certificates like

85
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,120
Mark talked about so this is where we

86
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,668
really shine and this is where we really

87
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,040
show value because the cool thing when

88
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:23,560
we start to do analysis is that you know

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,409
in our heads we start to see patterns we

90
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,209
start to see you know outliers we start

91
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:30,400
to make judgments about the data that

92
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,019
we're looking at and we just start

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,750
coming up with really cool insights and

94
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,840
and that's really powerful and then

95
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,909
somewhere between analysis and action

96
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,220
like unconsciously or not we kind of

97
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:44,189
just hope that our stakeholders are

98
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,009
gonna do something with that information

99
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:50,259
but here's a question if the analysis

100
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:51,869
isn't only in our heads then what are

101
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:54,369
our stakeholders taking action on

102
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,139
because they can't take action on the

103
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,680
assessments that are just in our heads

104
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:01,659
and that's a really big deal because our

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,209
knowledge of threats and what we know

106
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,099
and what we think about threats that is

107
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,449
the only currency we have as analysts

108
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,060
and that's the only way we can show

109
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:12,039
value to our organizations so if that's

110
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,739
not transparent and if it's not clear

111
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,120
and if it's not accessible and if we're

112
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,090
not being held accountable for our

113
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,009
analysis then that's a problem so what

114
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,280
is that thing what is that missing link

115
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:26,280
between analysis and action

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,010
it's the finished report so this is my

117
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,690
main argument for today and you know

118
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,570
like a good Intel analyst is my bottom

119
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,850
line up front so I argue that finished

120
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,860
reporting is the only way to memorialize

121
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,260
what we know and what we think about

122
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,060
threats and to preserve that knowledge

123
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,330
forever because once you write it down

124
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,430
on paper it is there forever and the

125
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,650
benefit of that is that our knowledge

126
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,290
becomes transparent and it becomes

127
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,390
accessible to the people who need to

128
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,550
make decisions and then like I just

129
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,520
mentioned the other cool thing is that

130
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,669
this creates accountability because if

131
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,229
we expect people to make decisions based

132
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,520
on the Intel that we're providing them

133
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,260
and our analysis is willy-nilly and

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,729
we're influencing bad decisions or bad

135
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:18,270
outcomes then we need to be held

136
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:20,190
accountable for that analysis so what

137
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,460
that means is we actually have to write

138
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,500
and commit to putting pen to paper and

139
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,989
for a lot of us I think this is kind of

140
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,479
a daunting challenge this is kind of how

141
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,479
a lot of us feel when we go to write

142
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,840
maybe we end up on slack instead of

143
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,659
Twitter that's probably more likely

144
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,119
these days but the point is I think

145
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,040
sometimes we feel kind of discouraged we

146
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,570
feel kind of overwhelmed you know or

147
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,790
even frustrated right because there's

148
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,770
just so much information that we kind of

149
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,130
have to synthesize and assimilate and

150
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,810
that's very difficult to do but the good

151
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,560
news is this is a totally rational

152
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,540
feeling and the reason is because I

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,900
think there are these underlying

154
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,300
challenges in sort of circumstances of

155
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,070
the environment we operate in that we

156
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,960
know we're there like we kind of sense

157
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,599
these things are there but we haven't

158
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,239
articulated those things so let's look

159
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,820
at what those challenges are okay so I

160
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,470
think there are three sort of challenges

161
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,900
you know looming under the surface and

162
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,210
it creates this sense of frustration

163
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,530
like we saw in that previous slide so

164
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,659
what are these three things so our

165
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,400
process number one that needs to improve

166
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,680
number two there are cognitive

167
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,130
limitations that we need to be aware of

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
and then number three the threats we

169
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,270
deal with are really really calm

170
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,590
flex and then we're going to talk I'm

171
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,609
going to go through each of these and

172
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,020
then we're gonna talk about you know

173
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,440
what is the outcome of these three

174
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,289
challenges so first on the process side

175
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,090
so the way I thought about this is that

176
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,030
I think there's a funny contradiction

177
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,369
between what we say in terms of how to

178
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,039
do good intelligence and then what we

179
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,240
actually do so things we say I think

180
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,490
we're all familiar with these things

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
because we've been saying them and we've

182
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,840
heard him here at this conference last

183
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,420
year and I wasn't here the previous

184
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,789
years but I can only assume that you

185
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,170
know these are the kind of things that

186
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,360
everyone was saying indicators don't

187
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,510
equal intelligence totally true totally

188
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,970
agree with that context is king who

189
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,190
doesn't love contexts so these are the

190
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,590
things we say but when we actually go to

191
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,350
do our analysis investment investigation

192
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,310
what does that look like well something

193
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,050
bad happens

194
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,700
maybe it's an internal incident you know

195
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,560
or some sort of external breach that

196
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,710
that is relevant to us based on

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,380
requirements right and then we start

198
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,289
rounding up a lot of information you

199
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,850
know maybe we take some scrappy notes

200
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,620
and we're probably collecting a lot of

201
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,610
indicators and you know plain text or

202
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,230
CSV files

203
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,800
you know whatever your format of choice

204
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,390
is and then the cool stuff that I

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,760
mentioned earlier you know we kind of

206
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,320
start making judgments we start to see

207
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,260
patterns and some of the data we're

208
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,510
looking at we reach cool insights and

209
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,400
then we stop and that's it maybe we get

210
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,010
distracted maybe we have to go to a

211
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,859
meeting maybe something else you know

212
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,599
pops up that that seems more important

213
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,520
so that's a problem and we'll see what

214
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,780
the outcome of this process is in just a

215
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:22,320
little bit so the next thing our brains

216
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,679
are not as good at processing and

217
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,500
storing information as we think they are

218
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,750
so cognitive science has determined

219
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,490
undoubtedly that our brains can only

220
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,360
store about seven pieces of information

221
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:40,140
at once and that is not a lot now the

222
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,320
cool thing is is that CIA has examined

223
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,110
this problem and they started looking at

224
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,910
it in 1984 so this quote comes from a

225
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,610
paper that CIA published and which you

226
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,969
can find online and it's about cognition

227
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:56,370
because the whole goal was to figure out

228
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:00,330
how our cognitive limitations affect our

229
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:02,339
analysis so the outcomes of that paper

230
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,040
the takeaways from that paper are number

231
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,520
one were better analysts when we

232
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,569
understand our cognitive limits and

233
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,910
number two we need writing as a tool to

234
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,950
expose and express the structure and

235
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,010
logic of our thinking and then number

236
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,620
three we have to think of writing as a

237
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,080
conversation between the analyst and

238
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,310
then the writer and the consumer the

239
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,330
person who's reading that because that's

240
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,459
what we're really doing here you know

241
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,050
we're having a conversation you know I'm

242
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,089
the analyst and I'm saying to the reader

243
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,770
hey these are the things I'm seeing this

244
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:39,390
is why they're important and this is why

245
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:42,420
we should care about those things so

246
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,339
keeping in mind that we're not very good

247
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,319
at dealing with lots and lots of

248
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,089
information you know our brains aren't

249
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,980
as great as we think they are we also

250
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,770
have to deal with really really complex

251
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,810
threats so I was originally gonna walk

252
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,550
through each of these but I think a much

253
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,069
better example was the example that

254
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,180
cliff walked through yesterday and he

255
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,620
took us on this you know globe-trotting

256
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,260
investigation of his where we went from

257
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,890
Berkeley over to Hannover Germany and

258
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,200
then back to Pennsylvania and you know

259
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,939
without the materials that he had and

260
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,640
had documented you know that would have

261
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,140
been a really difficult investigation to

262
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,120
follow I even still had trouble

263
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,089
following it and this is when you know

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,530
the internet was still in its infancy so

265
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,650
that was a really complex threat and

266
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,060
then the one point I'll make about the

267
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,100
whole DN C hack you know I think we're

268
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,589
all very familiar with sort of the the

269
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,920
technical details there but what stands

270
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:40,110
out to me about that case is that the

271
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,870
analysis that we were looking at and

272
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,030
some instances creating was really

273
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,100
hitting on like the highest strategic

274
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,230
levels I mean all of a sudden we have to

275
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,810
understand foreign policy and

276
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,750
international affairs and we have to

277
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,189
understand Russian information in

278
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,750
Russian information operations doctrine

279
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,449
like that stuff is really complicated

280
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,310
and that's just the peer analysis side

281
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,939
because then on the right side we have

282
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,329
to answer to

283
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,070
questions from our stakeholders so

284
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:10,620
answering what happened just doing that

285
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,930
is difficult because it takes a lot of

286
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,820
time to pull together information just

287
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,550
getting the facts right you know a lot

288
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,400
of times can be really difficult second

289
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,630
question are we at risk so this is one

290
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,319
of the things that Lincoln touched on

291
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:27,090
yesterday and what became clear to me is

292
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,970
that there are so many components of

293
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,140
risk and as threat until analysts you

294
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,080
know this is something I know I'm not

295
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,510
good at is communicating with risk

296
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,040
people or people who manage risk we kind

297
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,680
of speak different languages and intend

298
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,270
to speak past each other so those are

299
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,819
difficult conversations to have and then

300
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,829
last thing can we detect or prevent this

301
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,110
threat that can also be a difficult

302
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,460
question to answer because believe it or

303
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,800
not threat intelligence teams don't

304
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,450
always live inside the sock or sit right

305
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,699
next to the sock or have direct access

306
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,100
to the tools that they're using or the

307
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,800
security controls or the owners of the

308
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,420
security controls so there's a lot of

309
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,010
knowledge you know analysts have to have

310
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,620
a lot of knowledge of the business and

311
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,150
of security controls and our technology

312
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,300
footprint and attack surface and

313
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,860
business operations you know to answer

314
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:20,599
those questions and that's all very

315
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:20,600
difficult to do also 2016 that was WOW

316
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,670
okay so we have these three challenges

317
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,900
process challenge cognitive challenges

318
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,540
and then of course the complex threats

319
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,360
so what's the result of all of this so I

320
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,069
think the result one thing is I would

321
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,410
call analytic fragments you know so

322
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,510
these are kind of the notes and pieces

323
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,920
of the story that we haven't woven

324
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,010
together into this you know beautiful

325
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,829
intelligence tapestry and then we're not

326
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,480
documenting our analysis and if we're

327
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,520
not documenting our analysis that means

328
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,590
we're not sharing the knowledge about

329
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,970
threats and then if we're not sharing

330
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,890
that knowledge and we're not documenting

331
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,530
analysis then there's no continuity in

332
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:05,980
our teams even if it's only one or two

333
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:08,050
people doing Intel analysis that's still

334
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,940
a problem because we all know what

335
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,130
happens you know when that great analyst

336
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,480
leaves the organization and they haven't

337
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,430
written anything down right they take

338
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,550
all of that knowledge with them so

339
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,699
that's why it's so important to preserve

340
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,800
what we know and what our analysis is

341
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,750
okay so we've got all these you know bad

342
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,439
problems out there how do we overcome

343
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,330
these things

344
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,680
oh wait well okay I've got one more

345
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,410
slide for you

346
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,780
so this quote comes from the same CIA

347
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,790
paper that I mentioned earlier that one

348
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,640
about cognition and I think this quote

349
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,130
kind of sums up really well you know

350
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,360
this whole section on challenges if we

351
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,070
did nothing but marvel at the

352
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,010
achievements of our minds we would leave

353
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,530
a lot left unsaid and actually yesterday

354
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:54,490
cliff said something almost to the exact

355
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:57,790
same effect and he said it's not enough

356
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,490
just to do the work so when I read this

357
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,410
quote the way I interpret this is that

358
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:05,050
it's cool to do cool things and do a

359
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,610
really cool analysis but if that's all

360
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,260
we're doing then we're doing a

361
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,530
disservice to ourselves and to our

362
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:14,350
intelligence customers

363
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:16,360
okay so challenge is how do we overcome

364
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:20,590
these things right this gets us to the

365
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,080
answer the finished report so first

366
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,150
thing I want to do is dispel what I

367
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,970
think is a myth about reporting and

368
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:31,840
writing and that myth is that you have

369
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,960
to write a 30-page apt one paper to

370
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,570
do reporting or that you know reporting

371
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,430
is just for strategic analysts that is

372
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,710
not true and this tweet is a great

373
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,779
example of why because when you read it

374
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,150
you know drak croak I think we all

375
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,880
follow him on Twitter he does really

376
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,949
cool stuff but he's telling us write

377
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,390
down everything we know about our

378
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:57,910
adversaries TTP's and tactics okay great

379
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,640
well when I read that who's who's doing

380
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,520
the writing right that's our jobs as

381
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,439
analysts to do that I'm certainly not

382
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,050
the one who can instrument the detection

383
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,440
and you know build the detection logic

384
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,459
to find those things and to find bad but

385
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,650
what I can do is put in the legwork and

386
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,420
do the research and figure out how these

387
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,300
things work and put them on paper and

388
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,099
then make them available to someone like

389
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,050
a jack crook or someone else who's gonna

390
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,550
do this hunting and who's actually going

391
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,089
to be you know configuring the controls

392
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,040
to find these bad things so this is a

393
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:36,250
great example of how we can drive action

394
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,770
at a tactical level reports don't have

395
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,630
to be 30 pages long shorter is actually

396
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,220
better like one and a half to one pages

397
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:47,620
is a pretty good length for a report

398
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,720
okay so when I think about finished

399
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,360
reporting I think about three components

400
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,870
so these three components are structure

401
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:01,030
style and so what so what is the first

402
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:03,220
one here structure so by structure you

403
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,110
have to have a logical flow to your

404
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,020
content and in the organization of your

405
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,720
thoughts so typically the way this

406
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,880
manifests is you have a simple title

407
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,080
okay it can just be a pithy title that's

408
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,439
fine you should have a summary and your

409
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,209
key points if you can't say your key

410
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,190
point or make your assessment in one

411
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,319
sentence then you really need to think

412
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,440
about what it is you're trying to say

413
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,790
so all those key points need to be you

414
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,589
know this is the bottom line up front

415
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,240
advice basically all those key points

416
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,070
need to be up front and then everything

417
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,760
after that needs to support those key

418
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,880
points and what you're saying

419
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,220
so that's structure so next this style

420
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,439
so this one's interesting I like talking

421
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,089
about style because it's kind of squishy

422
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,760
it means a lot of different things to

423
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,130
different people but at the very least

424
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,689
it should mean complete sentences so I

425
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,010
think this is where a lot of us get

426
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,010
tripped up when we start taking notes

427
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,329
you know we kind of just jot down

428
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,279
phrases and you know notepad plus plus

429
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,079
or something like that and then we go to

430
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,609
read these things a few weeks later and

431
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,490
we have no idea what we were trying to

432
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,479
say so complete sentences is a really

433
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,699
good place to start

434
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,990
when you're thinking about style and

435
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:16,220
thinking about how to capture your

436
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:18,709
knowledge in a good way the second one

437
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,799
is tailoring your message to the

438
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:24,140
audience so for a good example of this

439
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:26,059
you know Rick Collins talked about this

440
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,549
yesterday in terms of developing

441
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:31,910
personas and sort of developing dossiers

442
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,260
on your intelligence customers and Rob

443
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,780
Lee also just mentioned this earlier

444
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,970
this morning so this is about knowing

445
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,450
the customers knowing what language they

446
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:45,440
speak knowing their jargon you know one

447
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,690
thing I found is don't send a CISO a 20

448
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,220
page report with like six pages but six

449
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,410
pages of appendices because they'll

450
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,610
never read it so that's a good example

451
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,799
of knowing your audience because

452
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,229
typically at that very executive level

453
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,120
all they're looking for is a few bullet

454
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,950
points tell me what I need to know I

455
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,270
don't care about anything else

456
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,730
you know I'll ask you the questions

457
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,730
after that and the other thing about

458
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,470
style is that when we write we don't

459
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,520
have to write like in this very like

460
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:16,610
antiseptic way you know we can be

461
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,700
conversational with how we speak when I

462
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,678
write reports I don't mind saying we you

463
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,500
know we the Intel team even if it's just

464
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,600
one person that's that's okay I think

465
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,120
I've heard some people say that you know

466
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,949
it's not good to use first-person when

467
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,899
writing Intel reports I disagree with

468
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,240
that because I think conversational

469
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,799
prose and simplifying these complex

470
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,770
things that we're talking about is a

471
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,059
great way to communicate the message

472
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,918
simplifying does not mean dumbing down

473
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,000
the content it just means making it

474
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,919
comprehensible

475
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,049
okay and then lastly is the so what

476
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,770
factor we talk about this a lot as a

477
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:54,309
community

478
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,780
you know intel has to be relevant of

479
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:59,950
course it does a lot of this is driven

480
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,510
by requirements so relevancy and the

481
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,809
other way I think about relevancy is by

482
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,640
thinking about you know not just the

483
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:07,928
scary stuff because we're pretty good

484
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,640
about talking about all the scary

485
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:12,100
threats but what are the opportunities

486
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,770
for the organization you know what can

487
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,789
we do to detect or prevent this threat

488
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:20,500
or what are the decision paths we could

489
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,570
take and what might be the possible

490
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,650
outcomes of those decision paths you

491
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,939
know if you're doing a more strategic

492
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,679
analysis so this is something I think we

493
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,090
overlooked a lot again we're good at

494
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,950
talking about the scary stuff we're less

495
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,320
good about thinking about you know what

496
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,110
are the opportunities that we can

497
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,129
provide or at least you know solicit for

498
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:44,350
our organization ok so this is like the

499
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,630
harmonious trifecta you know of these

500
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,370
reporting components here I recognize

501
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,710
that we don't live in a perfect world so

502
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,840
it's difficult to get all of these

503
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,530
things these three things together at

504
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,840
once

505
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,480
so what does it look like when we have

506
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,120
you know two of these but not the other

507
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,490
so we have a structure and so what so

508
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,219
what does this look like chances are you

509
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,070
know this is a professional organized

510
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:12,270
cool looking report and somewhere in

511
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:15,340
there there's you know relevant content

512
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,049
but the message is getting lost because

513
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,059
we're not communicating that message in

514
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:22,650
an effective way right remember we have

515
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:24,760
to tailor the message to the audience

516
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,640
so what does it look like when you have

517
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,740
structure but no style so this one's

518
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,400
kind of obvious because the content it's

519
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,169
just not relevant or maybe there is

520
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,929
relevant content in there but you

521
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:40,450
haven't said why it's relevant because

522
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,580
don't make the assumption that the

523
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,890
customer knows why they should care

524
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,730
about the thing you're reporting on so

525
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:50,010
that's something to think about and then

526
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,530
so what plus style

527
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,360
this actually is not a bad combination

528
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:57,750
because we're talking about something

529
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,610
relevant and we're communicating it in

530
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,340
away we're just lacking in that

531
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:04,020
structure who cares well you should care

532
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,120
because you will never get to go on

533
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,180
vacation again because the report you

534
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,399
just wrote cannot be repeated okay that

535
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,150
is not a repeatable process so we like

536
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,470
structure we like consistency it's the

537
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,820
reason why you know we pick up the New

538
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,530
York Times or The Wall Street Journal

539
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,500
every day and when you flip to Section B

540
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:25,770
2 or C 3 you know exactly what's going

541
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,530
to be there so it you know structure and

542
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,730
consistency makes us feel safe how many

543
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,060
of you are actually sitting in the same

544
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,580
seats that you were sitting in yesterday

545
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:38,659
ha ok not as many as I thought so yeah

546
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,659
we'll try that again next time

547
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:48,240
ok so how do we consistently get into

548
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,800
the center of this Venn diagram where we

549
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,860
have these three reporting components

550
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,990
here so this is where we get to actually

551
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,370
you know putting it all together getting

552
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,850
some advice that we can take home with

553
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:02,129
us ok so I think there are two things we

554
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,750
need to do the first is at the program

555
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,670
level for our threat intelligence

556
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,040
programs we have to institutionalize

557
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:11,370
writing as a core component of our

558
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,340
tradecraft and then the second thing we

559
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,189
have to do as analysts is just we have

560
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,300
to become better writers and remember

561
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,120
that you know threats are gonna get more

562
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,830
complex our brains are not getting

563
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,510
better maybe until like we have to wait

564
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,210
like 50,000 years until they evolve a

565
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,970
little further so this is why we have to

566
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,800
hone our writing skills so let's talk

567
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,590
about this first thing here that the

568
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,379
tradecraft component okay so tradecraft

569
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,740
what do we mean by that it's a cool

570
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,990
sounding word and I think we tend to use

571
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,000
it a lot in this community but I don't

572
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,060
think we've really talked about what it

573
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,860
means and what it means for us now the

574
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,510
good news is I think we have an

575
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,879
intuitive sort of sense of what

576
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:57,150
tradecraft means in like the traditional

577
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,230
spy verse by espionage sort of world you

578
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,390
know what does good and bad tradecraft

579
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,690
look like well good tradecraft is maybe

580
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,780
something like using dead drops to you

581
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,610
know pass messages secretly or doing

582
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,430
surveillance detection runs to make sure

583
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:13,330
you know you

584
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,710
have a tail but tradecraft in this five

585
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,510
or spice sort of world is much more

586
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:23,020
obvious when it's really bad so this is

587
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:25,000
a story of a guy named Ryan Fogle and he

588
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,550
was a diplomat posted in the US Embassy

589
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,950
in Moscow and he wasn't there for very

590
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,620
long before Russian police picked him up

591
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,450
in the streets in 2013 and they arrested

592
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,219
him and they accused him of spying and

593
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,860
trying to recruit a Russian security

594
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,260
officer why would they do that well on

595
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,490
his person they found a blonde wig at

596
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,010
brown wig several pairs of sunglasses

597
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,150
several disguises maps of Moscow one

598
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,710
hundred thirty thousand dollars in cash

599
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:51,190
communications material folding knife

600
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,830
pepper spray RFID RFID shield compass

601
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:59,470
some other accoutrements okay things

602
00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:01,240
like that so so what good spy would like

603
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,310
actually carry around these things on

604
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,980
their person you know I think if you're

605
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,030
trained in the craft of espionage you're

606
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,890
probably going to be a little more

607
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,970
discreet about what you're doing when

608
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,000
you're roaming around the streets of

609
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,710
Moscow so those are some examples of

610
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,590
good and bad tradecraft you know in that

611
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,120
traditional world but what is it what

612
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,179
does tradecraft look like in our world

613
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,129
so it looks something like this it's not

614
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:28,380
quite as cool as like blonde wigs and

615
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:33,450
pepper spray but that's okay

616
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:37,270
so this chart comes from the AI NSA and

617
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:39,100
since about 2011 this is an organization

618
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,440
who's been putting out a lot of great

619
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,699
white papers and content around cyber

620
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,470
threat intelligence and I think they've

621
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,830
actually really advanced you know our

622
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:50,170
thinking in this space so they have a

623
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,429
cool paper that talks about what are the

624
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:54,640
skills that a threat intelligence

625
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:57,220
analyst needs and this is what it looks

626
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,350
like so I know I know some of you can't

627
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,330
read it and we'll walk through it so on

628
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:05,469
the bottom we have like the really cool

629
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:08,189
technical sexy stuff like computing and

630
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:11,260
networking reverse engineering

631
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,150
penetration testing cryptography okay so

632
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,590
this is all like the really cool stuff

633
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,530
this is all the stuff that gets all the

634
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,540
attention and then on the top right we

635
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,250
kind of have like you know the softer

636
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,500
boring skills like communication and

637
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,150
collaboration but these things are at

638
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,070
really important so in the top right

639
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,450
these are the kind of things that you

640
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,990
know that we've been talking about here

641
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:33,310
so technical writing you know writing

642
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,000
for your audience and knowing your

643
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:38,770
audience knowing how to debate and you

644
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,660
know build your argument knowing how to

645
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,000
synthesize and assimilate information in

646
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,150
a really good way and then effectively

647
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,490
communicate that so this is a core

648
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,320
component of our tradecraft and I like

649
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,480
this chart because it puts it on paper

650
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,649
and I want to highlight that piece and

651
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,180
then the other thing to consider is that

652
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,640
you know this isn't just unique to us

653
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,580
but you have an organization the CIA

654
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,370
whose entire business is producing

655
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,879
intelligence and this is what they're

656
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:12,729
telling their analysts that good

657
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,890
intelligence depends on clear concise

658
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,290
writing and think about it they have all

659
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,880
this cool technology you know they're

660
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,080
collecting tons and tons of data and

661
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
this is what they're telling their

662
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,790
analysts is that we have to write to

663
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,380
effectively communicate intelligence so

664
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,540
the point here is that you know this

665
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,950
this organization their business is

666
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,110
intelligence and they've

667
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,410
institutionalized tradecraft so that

668
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,959
means we need to do the same thing okay

669
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,820
so at the analyst level what do we

670
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,670
actually need to do to hone our writing

671
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,429
skills so there is no better place to

672
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:49,300
get writing advice on cybersecurity than

673
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,400
the 17th century so this is Francis

674
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,460
Bacon if you don't know who he is he was

675
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,550
actually a really cool analyst so this

676
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,800
guy was basically a pioneer in the

677
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,379
Scientific Revolution and kind of the

678
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,590
father of what we know now is the

679
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,480
scientific method and so you know during

680
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,459
his time everyone's learning more about

681
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,170
the natural world there's there's tons

682
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,500
of tons of information out there and

683
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:16,480
he's reading all of this but ultimately

684
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,520
you know this is kind of where he sits

685
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,580
in terms of how do we process all this

686
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,580
information so you know reading helps us

687
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,679
to understand what's around us if we can

688
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,810
internalize it that conference part then

689
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,000
that's pretty cool but writing like if

690
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:34,450
we can actually articulate you know our

691
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,100
understanding of the world then that

692
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,750
makes us exact and if

693
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,209
you can't write then you better have a

694
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,650
really good memory now Francis Bacon

695
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,830
didn't have the benefit of cognitive

696
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,720
science like we do today but we know

697
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,899
that remember we can only store seven

698
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,990
pieces of information so he kind of knew

699
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,030
that as well and that's pretty cool okay

700
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,350
so more writing advice let's

701
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,350
fast-forward like three hundred twenty

702
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:03,520
years to Winston Churchill pops up again

703
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:06,850
here so in 1940 Winston Churchill wrote

704
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,100
a memo to his war staff in his war

705
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,080
Council and think the war is in full

706
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,418
swing Winston Churchill's Prime Minister

707
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,270
he's getting tons and tons of reports

708
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,700
and information every day and this kind

709
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:21,309
of frustrated him so he wrote this memo

710
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,140
that said basically this like I'm

711
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,700
getting a massive papers every day and

712
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,549
the points you're trying to communicate

713
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,580
to me they are not clear this wastes

714
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:33,490
time in this waste energy so here's some

715
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,070
advice for you first of all write short

716
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,559
sentences and write short paragraphs and

717
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,520
also make your points clear so I know

718
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,190
what you're talking about

719
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,280
the second thing is if you have a bunch

720
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,750
of data or statistics then throw that

721
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,710
all in the appendix because I don't care

722
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:54,220
about it and the last thing is avoid

723
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:57,610
what he calls bully phrases and official

724
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:01,260
ease jargon so bully phrases are like

725
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:03,699
really long run-on sentences I actually

726
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,408
attempted to write down or wanted to

727
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,120
write down some of these but I didn't

728
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,190
write them down so I was gonna have them

729
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,629
in my pocket and like pull out you know

730
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,880
some of these wooly phrases that he

731
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:15,100
gives examples of but I didn't write it

732
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,059
down so I didn't need my own dog food

733
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,189
there but the point is is that you know

734
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,639
he's he's telling his staff to just be

735
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:27,429
concise with your reporting and in terms

736
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,990
of that official ease jargon part that

737
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:31,960
goes back to just being conversational

738
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,510
right and just speaking simply about the

739
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,010
things we're trying to talk about so pay

740
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,658
attention to this writing vice it's so

741
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,440
good that the British government is

742
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:42,480
still talking about it

743
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,700
okay and then you know what is like a

744
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,990
more modern formula for thinking about

745
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,810
how we write and how we compose our

746
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,600
content so you know this is a pretty

747
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:54,450
popular Intel quote I think we're all

748
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,270
familiar with this : pal

749
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:59,670
tell me what you know tell me what you

750
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,560
don't know and then tell me what you

751
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,060
think and I really like this last part

752
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,850
here because then I'll hold you

753
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,080
accountable for those things so what

754
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,149
does it look like when we actually you

755
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,370
know break out this formula what do you

756
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:14,250
know okay so these are all of our notes

757
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,840
right and now we've transformed and

758
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,600
massaged those notes into complete

759
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,510
sentences and those analytic fragments

760
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,580
those pieces you know we've woven all of

761
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,710
that together into a complete story to

762
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,350
outline here all the things that we know

763
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,850
and then what do we don't know okay

764
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,360
these are simply the information gaps

765
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,830
but it's important to make those clear

766
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,270
because then those become a springboard

767
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,740
right for a sort of continued

768
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,300
investigation or research and now you

769
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,450
have stuff to pursue it's those

770
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,370
information gaps and then lastly what do

771
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,860
you think this is all the great analysis

772
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,270
and assessments that we've been making

773
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,209
in which have been swimming around in

774
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,500
our heads but now they're on paper you

775
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,850
know and now they're structured in this

776
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,140
simple formula here okay so to kind of

777
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,090
wrap things up you know this is very

778
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,340
similar to the bluff slide I had earlier

779
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,340
finished reporting why do we need to do

780
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,480
this why is it so important it

781
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,949
memorializes our knowledge when you

782
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
write something down it's there forever

783
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,510
and the knowledge stays there with your

784
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,310
team and with your organization once you

785
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,129
do that that knowledge becomes

786
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:19,110
accessible and it becomes transparent to

787
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,940
anyone who wants to access it and that's

788
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,580
a great thing because then people can

789
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,580
start making decisions off of that and

790
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,620
we're driving action and then lastly

791
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,360
another thing I've hit on a few times it

792
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,830
makes us accountable we have to be

793
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,689
accountable remember our stakeholders

794
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,100
are investing lots and lots of money

795
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,950
into these threat intelligence

796
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,230
capabilities and we can't be making

797
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,930
willy-nilly assessments that influence

798
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,980
bad outcomes and decisions and

799
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,710
ultimately that's how we demonstrate

800
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,840
value to the organization so when you go

801
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,150
to work tomorrow these challenges are

802
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,860
still going to be here you know your

803
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,970
process that's something we can improve

804
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,590
but

805
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,140
you know you might still find yourself

806
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,939
sort of getting in this rut where you're

807
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,740
you know creating kind of scrappy notes

808
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,810
and really just focus on indicators so

809
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,380
that's still there cognitive challenges

810
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:09,030
that's not going away and then the

811
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,790
complexity of frets okay that's

812
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,129
definitely not going away

813
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:16,530
but think about this really commit be

814
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:19,620
disciplined and deliberate right about

815
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:22,320
writing down what you know think about

816
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,669
structure style so what okay those are

817
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,740
the three components of the report we

818
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,090
talked about remember that simple

819
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,530
formula from : pal

820
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,449
tell me what you know tell me what you

821
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,149
don't know tell me what you think and

822
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,830
then lastly you know there's tons of

823
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,390
great old-school advice on how to write
