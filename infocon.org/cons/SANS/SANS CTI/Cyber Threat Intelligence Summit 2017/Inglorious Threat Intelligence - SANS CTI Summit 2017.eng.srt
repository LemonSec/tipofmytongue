1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,820
[Music]

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,209
so does anybody know what this is a

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:19,210
picture of so I'm a I'm like World War

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:20,200
two geek and you can tell by Inglourious

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,830
thread how many people have seen

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,060
inglorious basterds so fair amount of

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,360
the room right it's Quentin Tarantino

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,560
movie fictional scenario in world war

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,400
two I'm gonna talk a little bit about it

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,110
but I travel a lot to the UK digital

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,550
shadows has an office in London and in

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,640
the spring I got to go to Bletchley for

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,870
the first time and it's one of the

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,750
coolest place I've ever been

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,379
I'm not a SIGINT guy but if you're

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,360
sitting even probably more so so these

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,370
are some pictures that I took from

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,430
Bletchley on the far right does anybody

20
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:58,078
know what whose office that is yeah Alan

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:01,870
Turing's office Hut 6 is the hut where

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,138
what becomes GCHQ essentially we're

23
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,689
doing Enigma decoding for the German

24
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:09,789
army and the German Air Force different

25
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:12,428
huts were have had different missions

26
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:15,579
there and then there's an intelligence

27
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:18,459
report that came out of it when it looks

28
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:20,408
back oftentimes especially for those

29
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:21,639
that do speaking let you may write an

30
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,170
abstract before you even really know

31
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:25,630
what you're going to present about so my

32
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,429
abstract was very vague but when I wrote

33
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,920
this and then I spent about four months

34
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:31,630
reading books and I was looking at

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,189
different intelligent services that were

36
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,899
in World War two and I thought what

37
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,178
lessons can we learn from World War two

38
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:39,609
lining back to you know our old school

39
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:41,200
kind of tradecraft theme of the summit

40
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:43,658
this year and so these are some of the

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,060
Intel agencies in the European theater

42
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:49,259
I'm actually more interested in European

43
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:55,509
theater than I am in the Pacific but mi6

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,979
mi5 SOE was a competitor of mi6 and I'll

45
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,749
talk a little bit more about that they

46
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,599
reported directly to Winston Churchill

47
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:04,568
on the Russian side you had the in KGB

48
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,819
in the NKVD an internal and external

49
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:09,640
intelligence organization and then on

50
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:11,420
the right we had German units now I am

51
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,049
going to be talking about Germany

52
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,700
in World War two so you know I'm gonna

53
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,380
mention things that the Nazis did and

54
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,089
things like that in no way is this any

55
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,620
kind of a duration of that but I think

56
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,610
there's important lessons to learn from

57
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,920
that

58
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,440
but the SD was essentially the

59
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,549
intelligence arm of the SS and the SS

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,870
was the very political group affiliated

61
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,150
with Hitler in the party there but

62
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,080
there's a big difference in the country

63
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,760
between that Intelligence Agency and okw

64
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,530
is what the bottom was was a German

65
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,730
military traditional German military

66
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,459
intelligence and I'll talk a little bit

67
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,910
more about that as it go on there's a

68
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:52,670
really really good quote that Winston

69
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,260
Churchill made the day or a couple days

70
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,238
after Operation Torch which I'm going to

71
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,070
lead into in a little bit as well now

72
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,720
this is not the end it is not even the

73
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,730
beginning of the end but it is perhaps

74
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,440
the end of the beginning and I actually

75
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,810
think that if we look back over the past

76
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,579
five years of this summit and a little

77
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,230
bit longer it we've been doing the

78
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,480
commercial private sector intelligence I

79
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,549
think this is a good place to sum it up

80
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,810
we have come a long way let's say in the

81
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,850
past five years of this particular event

82
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,320
but there is so much further that we

83
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,850
need to go and I think a lot of the

84
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,090
talks that are gonna focus on the next

85
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,040
two days tradecraft analysis old-school

86
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,880
thinking really ties into this well so I

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,239
thought it was a really really good

88
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:33,470
quote how many people know who Wild Bill

89
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:36,290
Donovan is so how many people know who

90
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,329
General Patton is a lot more hat hands

91
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,150
in the air like Patton is seen as a very

92
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,700
high-profile figure a lot of energy very

93
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,950
excitement he is Donovan Wild Bill

94
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,780
Donovan is the equivalent on the Intel

95
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,298
side he's basically the father of the

96
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,549
modern CIA and I would also say JSOC as

97
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,709
well things that he was doing in World

98
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:58,190
War 2 line up to those missions today

99
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,739
quite closely if you look at the state

100
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,079
of US intelligence in 1941 before we

101
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,269
entered the war primitive parochial

102
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,070
underfunded under man and it was

103
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,049
literally a dumping ground for terrible

104
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,730
officers you had an army intelligence

105
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,680
organization you had a navy intelligence

106
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,720
organization and then you had State

107
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,549
Department very siloed doing their own

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,589
missions there was nothing looking above

109
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,750
you no forest for the trees type of

110
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,390
thing and then introduced Wild Bill

111
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,419
Donovan he was a World War one infantry

112
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,370
officer he got a Medal of Honor he was

113
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,770
very much a lead from the front kind of

114
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,270
guy he actually went on the landings and

115
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,039
he didn't sort of do the first waves of

116
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,659
the landings in the Mediterranean but he

117
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,729
was going out front so imagine the

118
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,640
number one spy master for the United

119
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,099
States landing on beaches in Italy can

120
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,419
you imagine if the enemy got a hold of

121
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,280
this person and his knowledge what that

122
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,570
would mean some would say it was quite

123
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,239
careless another interesting story with

124
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,760
him is at one point he had some friction

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,190
with someone in caring for his Burma but

126
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,930
it was in in in Asia and they actually

127
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,690
went out on a plane to a Forward

128
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,760
Operating Base the two of them landed

129
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,500
the runway was too short they couldn't

130
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,640
necessarily take off so it takes off in

131
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,130
the air they have to fly the plane

132
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,289
sideways between two trees to get out I

133
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,330
mean he almost died in this one

134
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,680
upmanship with this direct report of his

135
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,539
that he had friction with it's a very

136
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,729
fascinating person he said great would

137
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:19,909
be great to see a movie about him now he

138
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,080
had he had the ear of FDR and he had

139
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:23,180
this really great quote and again I

140
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,740
think this really applies to today for

141
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,810
us in threat intelligence information is

142
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,270
useless unless it is intellectually I'm

143
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,610
sorry intelligently directed to the

144
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,229
strategic purpose again if you look back

145
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,720
over the past five years of us doing

146
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,099
this event or past four years you know

147
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,560
last year we started talking about

148
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,849
strategic Klopp had an idea last year

149
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,500
that we frame it around tactical

150
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,450
operational and strategic we still have

151
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,860
a very long way to go on the strategic

152
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,900
purpose I think that ties in well with

153
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,510
the Churchill quote that I led with so

154
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,650
he wrote this letter to FDR and he

155
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,500
talked about the strategic purpose

156
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,810
something that was seeing across a me

157
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,250
Army Navy State Department intelligence

158
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,590
it was giving good information for

159
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,570
leadership and and the Office of

160
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,909
Strategic Services was formed originally

161
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,270
it was called COI the coordinator of

162
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:09,770
information and reported directly to FDR

163
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,190
he did this proposal and he ended up

164
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,810
reporting to the Joint Chiefs of Staff

165
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,570
and base was able to save his agency and

166
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,400
they became the OSS if if he hadn't made

167
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,620
that maneuvering perhaps you know the

168
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,179
OSS which was disbanded after World War

169
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,409
two and then became the CIA maybe it

170
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,729
wouldn't be where it is today if it

171
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:30,409
wasn't for him going under the wing of

172
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:32,690
JC s behind enemy lines here is a map

173
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:34,399
from one of the CIA libraries of

174
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,440
although it doesn't really come out

175
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,950
quite so well you know some of these old

176
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,200
screenshots that I have

177
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:44,550
or documents don't come up quite so well

178
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,680
but basically they're marking OSS teams

179
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,930
that are operating inside France

180
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,660
Jedburgh teams which was another group

181
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,490
out there basically trying to stir up a

182
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,390
low-intensity conflict an insurrection

183
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,370
guerrilla warfare against the occupying

184
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:02,159
Germans and then the Vichy French in the

185
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,340
South where that was occupied this

186
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,390
actually ties directly into into

187
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:12,090
inglorious basterds they were an OSS

188
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,099
team operating in France and Germany as

189
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,659
well does anyone know who the OSS

190
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,080
commander was in this movie here's some

191
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,010
trivia for it he's only on a phone call

192
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,969
at the end of the movie when they're

193
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,860
negotiating the surrender of Christopher

194
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:29,460
I forgot whatever that guy's last name

195
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,660
is it's Harvey Keitel and Harvey Keitel

196
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,130
has a tendency to pop up and Quinn

197
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,890
Tarantino movie so he's the OSS

198
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,260
commander that makes the deal to have

199
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,539
the German you know come over to the US

200
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,980
side basically of course if you've seen

201
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,720
the movie they leave him a little gift

202
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,700
but that was not appropriate to include

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,410
in my slide deck so like any

204
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,120
Tarantino movie my chronological

205
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,520
timeline is going to be off so now we're

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,250
going to go to Operation Torch which is

207
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,080
actually before the Jedburgh teams and

208
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,350
OSS was operating in France

209
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,580
anyone know operation torches so I'm

210
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,710
such a geek before I had a password

211
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,450
manager all of my passwords were World

212
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,120
War two code names

213
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,680
so torch made up one of my very first

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,050
passwords when I started having a

215
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,250
thematic approach but rest assured now I

216
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,190
don't have that now I have thirty

217
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,720
character random passwords all stored in

218
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,719
one file as a single point of failure

219
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:24,529
so Operation Torch is pretty significant

220
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,539
in World War two history this is the

221
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,879
Allied invasion of North Africa it was

222
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,659
also the first time that us-led the

223
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,939
efforts there

224
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:33,468
British were involved as well but

225
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:35,599
they're very concerned about the Vichy

226
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,819
French potentially fighting them so they

227
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,860
didn't want the Brits to be the lead or

228
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,688
have any kind of publicity about it at

229
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,089
one point it was even talked about the

230
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:46,279
British troops wearing American uniforms

231
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,110
and this is a very common today we see

232
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,350
that happening in a down range right now

233
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,850
where people are wearing the locals

234
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,040
uniform so they don't stand out this was

235
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,720
a very very important mission it was

236
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,189
very critical for the war efforts and

237
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,319
there was a number of high-level

238
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:04,910
high-level goals for it one was to

239
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:07,000
inspire a guerrilla warfare campaign

240
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,670
against the French this actually failed

241
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,939
they were able to leverage 12 State

242
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,170
Department consuls and in of course most

243
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:16,670
people say their State Department that

244
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,139
really means they're CIA these days but

245
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,910
it was essentially what they were doing

246
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,069
back then they had people in theater and

247
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,259
they were trying to to raise this

248
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,949
guerrilla warfare and it wasn't quite

249
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,990
successful

250
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,750
another mission was they didn't want the

251
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,420
French to fight the US troops that were

252
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,750
landing they also failed here there was

253
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,699
about 5,000 people had their lives lost

254
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,379
so it was not an insignificant number

255
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,719
the problem that they had here was they

256
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,730
had imagined like brigade commander

257
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,899
people that were down with not fighting

258
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,949
but they couldn't go up to the division

259
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,779
level they didn't have a high enough

260
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:50,149
leader to be able to say no we're not

261
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,740
going to fight but what they did do a

262
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,480
good job on these 12 individuals

263
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,970
actually 13 with their leader was give

264
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,189
information on strengths troop this

265
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,449
disposition to help the Allies when they

266
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:01,579
came in and did their landings another

267
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:03,139
thing that they did quite well was give

268
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,149
them landing conditions and of course

269
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:07,939
for any any Marines in the house right

270
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:09,079
that practice and fabious assaults know

271
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:11,089
it's really important when you're going

272
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:15,258
to land they also were able to smuggle

273
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:17,300
out natives in Morocco that helped guide

274
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,670
the fleet that was landing through

275
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,008
Straits of Gibraltar so they they had

276
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,259
good success there so they failed on two

277
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:26,149
of the broader goals for the operation

278
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:29,029
but they were successful in two but

279
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:31,100
going back to strategic purpose this was

280
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,509
seen as a huge success for OSS it was

281
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,200
the first time OSS was partnered with

282
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,540
combat

283
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,850
organizations the strategic purpose of

284
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,730
Operation Torch was to ultimately open

285
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,100
up a second front right so they did have

286
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,170
failure but they were aligned and had

287
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,389
success where it mattered so the lesson

288
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,490
here is if you and your organization's

289
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,620
can determine what the strategic purpose

290
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,300
of your group is you may be an agency

291
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,470
and it's attached to mission you may be

292
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,449
private sector and it's attached to

293
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,130
revenue and profit things like that you

294
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,479
may lose some battles but overall you

295
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,329
can have success if you're aligned to

296
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,829
that strategic purpose operation

297
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,939
barbarossa does anyone know what this

298
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:10,579
one is so this is the German invasion of

299
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:14,410
Russia one of the biggest mistakes of

300
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:14,410
many mistakes that Hitler made in a war

301
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,209
there was this well it's not a surprise

302
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,269
that the Germans at the time at least

303
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:24,680
the Nazis thought they were the greatest

304
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,970
race on the planet right you can see all

305
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,290
the atrocities that they did they

306
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,040
thought the Russians would just fold

307
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:34,490
down and fight and that was not the case

308
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,800
couple lessons here is one is avoid

309
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,870
warfare in Russia in the winter

310
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,219
Hitler was very optimistic about their

311
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:45,380
ability to to take take over Russia the

312
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,610
Ukraine Moscow as well and in fact they

313
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,390
were very very successful when the

314
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,829
Vermont came in a lot of quick wins but

315
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,519
then they made it to the winter and they

316
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:57,290
had success this one this one has

317
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,060
nothing to do with the movie or the book

318
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,750
but I thought I thought it was funny

319
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,219
nonetheless and if you don't get this

320
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,110
joke you really should watch The

321
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,040
Princess Bride I mean I guess it kind of

322
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,860
dates you a little bit but um great

323
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,290
movie does anyone know who Admiral

324
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,209
Wilhelm Canaris is you can tell by the

325
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,740
subtitle that he was the head of a bear

326
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:23,869
so he was a head of military

327
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:26,060
intelligence in Germany very typically

328
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,620
not involved in politics they took a lot

329
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,239
of pride and not being involved in

330
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,459
politics he was basically working

331
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,260
against Hitler most of the time the

332
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,969
Hitler's regime there he hated Nazis

333
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:39,139
most of there was an intense competition

334
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,750
trying to throw other people under the

335
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,850
bus the intelligence services the SD and

336
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,199
the AB there they were fighting against

337
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,610
each other they were spying against each

338
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,990
other

339
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,310
significant amount he's a very

340
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,020
interesting person he was a fluent

341
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,510
Spanish speaker he did a lot of work in

342
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,069
South America he idea actually escaped

343
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,430
from South America and it's a very

344
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,680
interesting interesting tale you can do

345
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,540
a whole talk on him in general he

346
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,140
actually recommended against operation

347
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:11,339
of our Bosa but he also gave some very

348
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:13,080
bad intelligence on this he was Hitler

349
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,670
was one of his intelligence customers

350
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,140
right and he had to provide some

351
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,990
analysis for him and the mistake that

352
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,069
the a bear made in assessing Russia was

353
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,010
they only looked at the traditional

354
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,210
order of battle their infantry divisions

355
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,200
their armored units what they didn't

356
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,060
take into account was all the

357
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,860
paramilitary units that were in Russia

358
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,469
and the pure amount of bodies that the

359
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,600
Russians could just throw you know

360
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,550
basically into a shredder right and that

361
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,430
was part of the reason that the Germans

362
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,709
got stuck getting in but can you imagine

363
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,599
trying to do intelligence briefings for

364
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,100
someone like Hitler right not

365
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,470
necessarily easiest in fact this

366
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,050
decision to invade Russia was made

367
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,370
without even telling the mi group for

368
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,380
the German army it was after the

369
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,970
decision was made that they then had to

370
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,890
come up with a plan right versus

371
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,590
providing an assessment in advance and

372
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,569
saying this it was all after the fact

373
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:03,240
the OSS there's actually two studies

374
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,940
done on Hitler during the war and this

375
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,160
is one that the OSS did a professor did

376
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,570
interesting thing about the OSS model it

377
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,680
was a net new organization

378
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,910
there were Hollywood actors there were

379
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,339
international businessmen there were

380
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,920
politicians it really was a huge melting

381
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,270
pot of individuals it's actually a good

382
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,800
lesson for us to learn you know as

383
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,870
people are building out their teams or

384
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,609
complementing their teams is don't just

385
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,500
focus on people that come from the

386
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,600
intelligence community don't just focus

387
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,680
on people that are have an incident

388
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,420
response for a technical cyber

389
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,829
background don't just focus on graduates

390
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,990
out of King's College or something like

391
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,700
that that that no traditional education

392
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,630
you know the more personalities you have

393
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,700
in the mix the better you will do what I

394
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:47,090
want to talk about now and for those

395
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,100
that how many people here are vendors

396
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,960
selling in the cybersecurity side okay

397
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,630
and then how many people here are

398
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,370
selling something to consumers their

399
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,540
business is consumer focused how many

400
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,800
people are familiar with the concept of

401
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,390
personas

402
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,189
so you know now that I'm a year actually

403
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,040
this week is a year in at digital

404
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,270
shadows and now I'm a dirty vendor we

405
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,770
use personas a lot but I think the

406
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,329
personas that are using the marketing

407
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,130
context can be applied to what we do

408
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,630
here actually at Forrester our persona

409
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,500
his name was Shawn Rhodes he had a name

410
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,390
he had a picture

411
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,400
Shawn Road stood for security and risk

412
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,720
so at Forrester we wrote - Shawn Rhodes

413
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,510
and we personalized at every decision

414
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,920
that you make is how are we gonna make

415
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,050
his life easier or her life easier

416
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,360
whatever the case may be if you look at

417
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,280
the types of personas that you that are

418
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,990
your customers here's some they may not

419
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,790
apply to everyone in the room a sock

420
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,290
analyst is one of your customers what

421
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,430
are you gonna provide - a sake analyst a

422
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,959
threat hunter David wherever David's at

423
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:51,520
pyramid of pain see I did I did mention

424
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:53,920
it Kyle must not be in the room thank

425
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,920
you thank you

426
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,930
the CISO is certainly a persona that

427
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,930
you're gonna be talking to other c-level

428
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,410
executives products - at the Saki

429
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,280
analyst level what you deliver there is

430
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,130
going to be different than what you

431
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,500
deliver to the CISO actually goes back

432
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,970
to what cliff was talking about on you

433
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,680
know telling a story the way you tell a

434
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,610
story - a sake analyst is very different

435
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,729
than the way you tell a story to a

436
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,470
business leader for each persona and

437
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,880
this is a short example of it you want

438
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,940
to understand them better so that you

439
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,110
can meet their needs and have them buy

440
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,460
into you and what you're trying to

441
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,980
accomplish so understanding their

442
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,050
motivations what motivates a person how

443
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,210
are they incented this is really really

444
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,500
important you know if people work

445
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,360
towards what they're incented on so if

446
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,310
you can hook in to some way that this

447
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,740
person makes money or their review gets

448
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,510
better it's really good to have the

449
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,720
reporting structure who do they report

450
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:52,090
up to and who reports to them and also

451
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,220
how do you support you know both sides

452
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,420
of that their skills and this is really

453
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,070
important as far as kind of tailoring

454
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,380
the the technical message are they

455
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,290
technical then it's okay to talk to them

456
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,490
about IO CS and reverse engineering and

457
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,829
things like that if they're not

458
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,120
technical that's the surest way to have

459
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:08,408
somebody shut down and never want to

460
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,039
talk to you again

461
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:12,019
they come from the intelligence

462
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,759
community if not I wouldn't be using

463
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:15,859
terms like PIR and all these other

464
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,069
acronyms that those of us from the IC

465
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:20,029
love to use you also shut them down

466
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,408
understanding their business acumen if

467
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,388
you start talking to them about business

468
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,589
risk they may not be at the level where

469
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:26,178
they're interested in that although I

470
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,168
would argue and you've heard me say this

471
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,360
for those that have been here in the

472
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:30,440
past we really need to understand what

473
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,439
the business risks are to your

474
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,629
organization be it an agency or private

475
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,149
sector commercial type of group because

476
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:39,709
everyone has a role in trying to try to

477
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:40,820
understand that risk in their own world

478
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,929
the sake analyst needs to have an

479
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,240
understanding of the overall business

480
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,610
risk so using those personas at the end

481
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,929
of my deck I actually have a link to

482
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,869
this but there's an infographic from a

483
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,279
marketing site that has it's really long

484
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,749
on different things that you could do to

485
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,149
build out personas for your intelligence

486
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:59,389
customers if you have marketing people

487
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:01,248
in your own organization be it you're a

488
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:03,740
vendor on the security side or if you

489
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:05,990
are you know consumer facing I would

490
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,950
talk to them they are no doubt building

491
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,840
personas because it's how you

492
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,129
effectively sell and maybe you can

493
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,869
leverage them and again you're also

494
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:14,600
getting out of the little bubble that we

495
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:19,990
often work in an IT or cyber or threat

496
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,799
intelligence dossiers so the Hitler

497
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,309
analysis that was done right was a

498
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,690
dossier on Hitler you can build dossiers

499
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:29,950
not to say your management is like that

500
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,659
at all not the best transition probably

501
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,669
but build dossiers on you don't have a

502
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:36,769
persona for everyone in the organization

503
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,450
that's an Intel customer then for your

504
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:40,580
very strategic people people that you

505
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,899
want to influence that you need to get

506
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,519
budget from you need to get that buy-in

507
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:45,469
for whatever your program's goal is

508
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,869
build a dossier on them it is tailored

509
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,429
to an individual what are their triggers

510
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:52,459
this is Becca and I were talking about

511
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:54,590
this yesterday at rapid7 they know not

512
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,480
to use the word feed with her because

513
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,789
her face turns red she starts to become

514
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,549
a gunny again starts to yelling at them

515
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:03,559
dressing them down when I was an analyst

516
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:05,690
at Forrester one of the early things I

517
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,789
did was actual intelligence it drives me

518
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,840
absolutely crazy so for these very key

519
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:11,330
people that you want to influence

520
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,850
understand their triggers and then avoid

521
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,529
them right the reverse of that is what

522
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,990
are they passionate about what can you

523
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,430
hook into

524
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,890
to get there in their interest I did a

525
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,050
blog on this I was talking about a month

526
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,930
ago it was related to Donald Trump and

527
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,639
how could the IC prepare intelligence

528
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,230
products to get him to buy into it this

529
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,300
is where a lot of this persona and

530
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,950
dossier stuff came from but what are

531
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,330
they interested in you know what gets

532
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,430
their attention and then I would start

533
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,870
off all my conversations with them with

534
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,760
with what gets their attention and then

535
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,469
document it this actually ties back to

536
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,660
what cliff was saying before as well

537
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,000
just like you would document things in

538
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,290
an investigation need to be documenting

539
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,270
these interactions that you're having

540
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,830
with these individuals and also include

541
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,920
what your strategic goal is for that

542
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,240
person you go have a much more receptive

543
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,040
audience if you can have this kind of

544
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,230
strategy so it's going to run through

545
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,629
five ways to connect so first personas

546
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,220
for all roles of your customers dossiers

547
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,860
for specific individuals but then you

548
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,760
have to connect with them first is use

549
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,100
your terminology

550
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,390
I'm sorry use their terminology not

551
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,790
yours which I kind of alluded to right

552
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,820
no P IRS for someone that doesn't even

553
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,230
know what intelligence is next is

554
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,800
focused on what they care about I kind

555
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,950
of alluded to that on the previous slide

556
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,870
a personal story and I think when I work

557
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,220
with Cisco's at Forrester where I work

558
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,399
with them now we always try to tell a

559
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,320
story actually Beca another good

560
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,170
interesting story for ya throwing you

561
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:44,270
out you're my straw man I guess what's

562
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:45,620
around fraud in e-commerce and it was it

563
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,050
was coupon was a coupon fraud is that

564
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,520
what it was this example there and then

565
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,220
being able to take something this is the

566
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,920
risk to the business use examples about

567
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,990
maybe how this has happened to

568
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,250
competitors or peer group people maybe

569
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,870
talk about how thread actors are

570
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,180
targeting and you weave this story

571
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,739
together but at the foundation is what

572
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,090
they care about and it's all about

573
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,610
storytelling right it's not giving them

574
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,780
a stupid very technical report that sort

575
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,659
of thing figure out how to tell the

576
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,560
story to that individual and then be

577
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,900
flexible

578
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,159
just like Incident Response you know if

579
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,010
you think back maybe three years ago

580
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,110
feel free to argue this this you know we

581
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,820
didn't have play books you know I think

582
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,659
people the one percenters had play books

583
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,350
how they're going to do Incident

584
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,060
Response but whose playbook for IR is

585
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,770
just

586
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,720
this path and I can only go up and down

587
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,280
this path nope I got a stay on target

588
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,200
imagine if you're getting tech support

589
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,060
from a call center that's its overseas

590
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,560
and they have their script and they

591
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,960
can't deviate from that script at all

592
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,790
just like an IR we need to be able to go

593
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,870
up and down the rows we need to have

594
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,909
flexibility built in it's not a

595
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,800
one-size-fits-all type of scenario for

596
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,850
your intelligence customers so you got

597
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,960
to be flexible to what's going to work

598
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,600
with them what's going to resonate with

599
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,610
them and then engage with them outside

600
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,010
of work now lately I've been trying to

601
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,330
work in barbecue into all my talks and I

602
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,580
thought this was a good example if you

603
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,230
if you come to Texas and you want it to

604
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,810
engage with someone you take them out to

605
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,240
barbecue this would be burnt ends how

606
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,740
many people have had burnt ends I think

607
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,630
I've said this many times but I think

608
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,570
pound for pound it's the best bite of

609
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,580
any meat that you can possibly have

610
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,110
they're delicious but so what you could

611
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,330
do is you're trying to influence people

612
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,679
let's take them out to lunch right

613
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,090
completely separate of the occasion that

614
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,530
you would have for your I don't know if

615
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,929
you're doing a quarterly threat brief

616
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,430
for the executive team get a champion a

617
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,680
really good way to do is to get a

618
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,970
champion and focus on one person have

619
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,470
them be your champion and then they can

620
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,690
start telling you when you're building

621
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,880
out personas you do interviews you do

622
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,080
lots of interviews internal/external and

623
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,730
things like that but get someone to be

624
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,679
your champion and that will be very very

625
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,680
helpful to your overall goal

626
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,060
operation North Pole anybody familiar

627
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,160
with this one so this is one I thought

628
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,190
was pretty interesting

629
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:01,520
so the Netherlands was occupied by

630
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:04,910
Germany just like France was occupied by

631
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,920
Germany and they're just like just like

632
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,530
the OSS was operating in France looking

633
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,850
to subvert German interests they're

634
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,280
trying to do the same thing in the

635
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,840
Netherlands except this time was SOE so

636
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,490
it was the British that we're trying to

637
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,959
do this this is one of the more

638
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,230
interesting counterintelligence stories

639
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,940
of world war two and it speaks to a lot

640
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,400
of the confusion around Intel it speaks

641
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:28,250
to that Intel is not definitive you know

642
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,380
at worst case it's a best guess and then

643
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,030
you may have certain you know we think

644
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,860
this is fifty percent good assessment

645
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,139
seventy-five percent this this

646
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,810
individual was in the German military

647
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,640
intelligence and this is the interesting

648
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,370
one because they actually cooperated

649
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,770
with the SD which is very rare but

650
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,469
basically what happened was with a major

651
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,940
discus running CI trying to detect

652
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,910
espionage agents operating in the

653
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,010
Netherlands mister Lauer's so mr.

654
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,060
flowers and a colleague air-dropped in

655
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,330
in the middle of the night into the

656
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,889
netherlands in his goal was to set up

657
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,929
communicate a lot of like what they were

658
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,870
doing with Operation Torch have a radio

659
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,390
operate out of an attic someplace

660
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:11,030
transmit strength troop disposition that

661
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,200
sort of thing at this time we didn't

662
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,149
know where the invasion was going to be

663
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,670
it hadn't been settled yet but he got

664
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,250
unfortunately for him he wound up with

665
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:22,220
two double agents and he got captured by

666
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:25,490
German intelligence a combination of the

667
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:28,670
SD and up there and it was a brilliant

668
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,620
move from Germany side as they basically

669
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,090
had this individual start transmitting

670
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,760
like everything is good to go

671
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,439
nothing to see here and there's a little

672
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,500
bit of controversy a story I don't get

673
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,860
to that but when these radio men were

674
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,450
doing their transmissions they had these

675
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,219
fail-safes built in so they could

676
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,130
indicate if they were under duress or

677
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,530
not well he put his security here he

678
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,760
left his security check out to indicate

679
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,480
that he was under duress but it was

680
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,010
missed it was that it was

681
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,169
and I'll go a little bit more into that

682
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,600
story next what ended up happening over

683
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:04,740
a two-year span of time is that 90 RAF

684
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:08,580
sorties were flown 54 Dutch SOE agents

685
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,710
were killed and 83 RAF crew died because

686
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,059
essentially what they would do was say

687
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,760
everything's good to go we're gonna

688
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:17,040
insert another team and then they would

689
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,540
land and German intelligence was right

690
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,168
there the CI teams and they would arrest

691
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,990
them

692
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:25,440
so they did this with great effect so

693
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,790
great that they got five hundred

694
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,950
thousand guilders in this time they also

695
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,950
got the US dollars in French francs

696
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,220
fifty three radio sets this will become

697
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:40,429
important in a second - as I dig into

698
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:43,530
this as well over 4,000 machine guns

699
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:45,059
fifty thousand rounds of ammunition they

700
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,770
said machine guns but they also got

701
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,480
pistols they got rifles they got

702
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,280
everything they got so much the Germans

703
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,590
had to have a warehouse just to store

704
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,418
all of this gear parachute in arrest

705
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,189
them have trucks ready to go take all of

706
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,690
their gear those radio sets were quite

707
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,040
heavy they had different models of them

708
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:03,299
but they were not the easiest to to use

709
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,178
and ultimately what ended up happening

710
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:08,010
was there was a seminary in the

711
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,340
Netherlands it was a prison and some of

712
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:14,220
the Dutch soldiers escaped and they made

713
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,350
it their way back to the UK and finally

714
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,600
for whatever reason between those who

715
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,120
members coming back to the UK and the

716
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,559
continued security check being omitted

717
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,330
they realized that this was blown and so

718
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,740
they weren't gonna send any more so as a

719
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,500
last laugh

720
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,540
major discus here was a troll and

721
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,940
trolling happens today and happened back

722
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:37,620
then quite a bit - this is what he sent

723
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:39,419
on April Fool's Day I guess was 42 April

724
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,889
Fool's Day from 12 different radio sets

725
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,679
he sent this message all at the same

726
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,450
time and essentially send more people

727
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,130
will treat them with the same care that

728
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,350
we treated the other 54 agents that we

729
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:52,830
killed and then that officially ended

730
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:55,199
this operation it's quite interesting

731
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,699
because a lot of the a lot of the things

732
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,429
that we see in this do apply it said

733
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,570
today I actually found these books I

734
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:01,830
didn't have a chance to read them as I

735
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,120
was doing the research but major gits

736
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,158
cos actually wrote a book here and

737
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,928
actually want to read this on my reading

738
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,890
list now - check this out but there's a

739
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:10,530
lot of controversy or

740
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,000
this and I think it actually ties back

741
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,520
to some of the controversy that we have

742
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,470
around attribution that we're doing now

743
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,270
and I think some of this actually kind

744
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,120
of queue up Brian and one's talk on

745
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,350
tomorrow when they dig into some of the

746
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,060
challenges associated with attribution

747
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,159
but here there's all these theories

748
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,710
about what was happening one was the SOE

749
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,230
was inept and they were they were very

750
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,910
much butting heads with mi6 I'll talk

751
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,220
more about that another one was that a

752
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,260
German agent working for SOE was saying

753
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,450
nothing to see here move along and they

754
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,250
purposely left out these these checks

755
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,590
we're not really certain there was a

756
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,270
fire and all the documents were lost

757
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,580
perhaps this is sitting in a basement

758
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,730
somewhere in GCHQ because there was

759
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,649
another theory that the British were

760
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,940
doing this on purpose to make the

761
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,770
Germans think the invasion was going to

762
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,600
happen in the Netherlands so there's all

763
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,550
this confusion and conjecture there was

764
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,500
investigations after the war so it

765
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,970
reminds me a lot of some of the stories

766
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,460
that you have with intelligence failures

767
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,990
in general but then also some of the

768
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,570
things that are going on on attribution

769
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,420
for us now couple lessons learned here

770
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,419
don't let rivalries impact analysis so

771
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,770
SOE and mi6 did not get along and one of

772
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,210
the other kind of theories was they were

773
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,340
so inept they didn't want anyone to know

774
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,020
about it so that they would look bad if

775
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,699
you think about us in the commercial

776
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,860
sector we have a lot of rivalries in our

777
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,570
own teams where analysts disagree it's

778
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,370
actually good for analysts to disagree

779
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,169
if you're doing it in the right way

780
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,040
because you're having different opinions

781
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,210
and you can come up with a better

782
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,670
assessment is if you don't have

783
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,870
groupthink but unfortunately as you

784
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,120
start to go a little bit bigger beyond

785
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,199
organisations you see analysts

786
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,100
disagreeing across different

787
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,780
organisations or competitive competitors

788
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,070
which then leads to this this has been

789
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,330
one of the most irritating things I

790
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,800
think for me and I know a lot of others

791
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,840
as well if you look pass over the past

792
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,240
four months and the elections is

793
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,879
sometimes I think we're two-year-olds in

794
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,070
this space we talk about how far we've

795
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,170
come in our assessments this is an

796
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,300
indicator how far we have to go because

797
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,250
we get wrapped up in pooh-poohing all

798
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,570
over someones assessment without ever

799
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,940
even seeing any of the data that they

800
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,439
made their assessment on I'm getting

801
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,750
here talk about triggers this would be a

802
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,250
good trigger for me and I got my heart

803
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,480
rate just just went up my blood pressure

804
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:19,400
just spiked we need to get rid of this

805
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,510
drama and unfortunately we haven't

806
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,490
structured analysis techniques

807
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,770
now SOE was a newer organization they

808
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:29,610
didn't have the the history that mi6 had

809
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:31,139
had maybe if they had had another group

810
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,699
of analyst looking at the same sergio's

811
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,710
talked about this you know you have two

812
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,180
different sets of analysts reviewing it

813
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,410
blind to each other they don't know

814
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,090
about it and see what assessment comes

815
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,760
up maybe a so we could have done more

816
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,010
structured analysis techniques to to

817
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,050
minimize what happened with those

818
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,610
security checks that were omitted this

819
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,870
could be a whole talk and I know there's

820
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,750
other talks that are gonna be happening

821
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,340
over the next two days on structured

822
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,870
analysis techniques so I won't dig into

823
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,490
it more I do have a reference to this is

824
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,929
actually a CIA doc it talks about eight

825
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,210
or nine different structured analysis

826
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:02,490
techniques I think the one most people

827
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,700
are familiar with now they don't come

828
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:08,160
out of the IC is probably ACH alternate

829
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,720
competing hypotheses actually our most

830
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,370
popular broad digital shadows last year

831
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,080
was on the Tesco breach on an ACH on

832
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,479
that I know threat Kinect has done stuff

833
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,330
on ACH so we see that I'd like to see us

834
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,800
as a community on the practitioner side

835
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,540
and the vendor side starting to do more

836
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,879
other types of structured analysis

837
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,620
techniques with a real world example so

838
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,420
that someone isn't familiar with it can

839
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,520
take it and understand start to do this

840
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,850
in your own organization and you can do

841
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,740
SATs without slowing down your process

842
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,990
you determine what type of essay to SAT

843
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,400
you do for what type of question you're

844
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,510
trying to answer so you don't have to

845
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,140
think oh my god I don't have time to do

846
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:44,070
ACH you don't always have to do that

847
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,770
this is something that in one of the

848
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,820
slack groups I'm in we and I know some

849
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,550
people in this room have taken it it's a

850
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,760
free class you know it's a it's a mohawk

851
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:55,590
course on analysis you know a lot of

852
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,870
times people don't have money so here's

853
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,220
a free course that you could go do if

854
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,889
you go a little bit further here's an

855
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,350
example for for me in Dallas

856
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,120
Southern Methodist University actually

857
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:09,840
has a certificate course it's a

858
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,459
week-long kind of a boot camp type of

859
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,310
thing but in this area I know there's a

860
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,050
lot of options there's online options as

861
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,909
well this is not a bad thing to work

862
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,430
into you know for your teams and I know

863
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,840
I try to do this with with my team is

864
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,180
actually I've got a person here right on

865
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,520
my team they got to come here as part of

866
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,080
their annual you know plan building this

867
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,730
kind of stuff into your training I know

868
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,830
we've already done our 2017 budgeting

869
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,180
but you know it helps with retention and

870
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,830
it's hard enough to retain people as it

871
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,210
is and you don't want to spend two or

872
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,360
three years grooming someone and then

873
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,410
have them leave for reasons like I want

874
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,820
to get better training I want to go to

875
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,290
one course a year I don't think that's

876
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,590
unreasonable so building that sort of

877
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,930
stuff and I think is really helpful to

878
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,030
summarize everything I think for me goes

879
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,770
back to strategic purpose and I've been

880
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,450
talking about this in many different

881
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,590
ways at all the well probably not the

882
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,900
first year the first year was really

883
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,399
indicator focused for me but as the time

884
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,960
to go on I see that still is a big gap

885
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,780
for us Klopp and I were talking about it

886
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,550
last night so understand the strategic

887
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:10,020
purpose of your organization and aligned

888
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:12,720
to it personas dossiers and connecting

889
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,920
that is how you in probably sets up some

890
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,420
of Christians talk I don't know where

891
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,990
Christians at because Christians got to

892
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,970
talk tomorrow right on on intelligence

893
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,960
reports and how to write good reporting

894
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,500
and things like that so some of this

895
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,240
stuff feeds in quite well to that the

896
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,890
rivalries we already talked about let's

897
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,140
try to minimize that and minimize the

898
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,580
drama and then start building

899
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,380
structured analysis techniques you could

900
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,750
have your own teams one of the things

901
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,580
that we do is we'll do a presentation on

902
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,900
a different technique that we applied

903
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,669
some place and then we'll go public with

904
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,620
it later but try to have maybe that's

905
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,360
you know each month or each quarter your

906
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,489
Intel teams are looking at a particular

907
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,570
problem you have applying a SAT to it

908
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,210
and then presenting it to the

909
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,939
organization as a takeaway for it and

910
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,040
then I'll ein with Wild Bill again

911
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:00,630
because he is such an interesting person

912
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,870
just crazy crazy individual but he did

913
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,670
so much and like say CIA JSOC I don't

914
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,780
know that they I mean a lot of times

915
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,370
going by perhaps they would still exist

916
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,379
but he did a lot of interesting things

917
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,709
with respect to here to that and this is

918
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,120
actually and I linked to this volume in

919
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,330
here but this is a letter he wrote to

920
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,860
FDR leading into this volume on the type

921
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,500
of work that they did it's very

922
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,610
interesting I think if you look at if

923
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,230
you look at this which I have this on

924
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,889
the next the next piece these are the

925
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:31,410
the Volume one report for Washington

926
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,420
organization and then the OSS operations

927
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,930
in the field they're very interesting

928
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,730
reads

929
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,660
they're not really long if you look

930
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,679
through it you might be able to find

931
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,710
some things you could adopt your own

932
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,910
programs or language around that and so

933
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,770
everything that I've referenced here

934
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,970
you've got this as a takeaway so you

935
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,389
want to look at the personas they're

936
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,780
here

937
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:50,670
the three books that I read one book on

938
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,570
Wild Bill and then two books on German

939
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,570
intelligence are here

940
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,799
