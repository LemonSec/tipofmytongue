[Music]

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:16,090
[Applause]

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,039
as anyone in the history of Summit's had

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,499
a better introduction than that I don't

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,699
think so that was that was quite simply

6
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:23,519
beautiful and bought it tear to my eye

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:27,009
thank you very much

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,439
she's right I was joking and I also also

9
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:32,469
asked for Rob Lee to be introducing me

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:37,120
through the medium of Dance however he's

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:39,760
not here so I need this thank you very

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,709
much that's very helpful I was going to

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,210
try and do my brain but we're not quite

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,550
there yet so yeah sorry sorry I've

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,039
embarrassed and let you down use of

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,059
conventional military intelligence

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,460
methodologies is predominantly what I

18
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:56,320
want to talk about mr. stroll made my

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,370
day yesterday when he said write stuff

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,249
down

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,038
people think I'm a bit weird I get

22
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:04,960
turned on by Excel whiteboards and

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,290
stationery those are things that I like

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,939
and I have six notebooks why do you have

25
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,229
six notebooks I have notebooks for link

26
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:16,119
analysis for mind charts for passwords

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,560
for client notes for confidential notes

28
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,090
I know these things I feel they why do

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,860
you write stuff down because I always

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,689
refer to them so when I said I was gonna

31
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,969
do a sans talk I thought what I'm gonna

32
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,439
talk about I'm gonna mind map it and I

33
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:28,419
took a picture of my mind map as my

34
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,889
content page so we're predominantly

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,689
going to just talk about methodologies

36
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,840
there's a few other things that I talk

37
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:36,279
about which people have also been mostly

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,289
talking about in the past couple of days

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,939
so I won't talk too much about bias and

40
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:42,789
dissemination but we do touch on them

41
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,500
because where they are Pether this is me

42
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:46,689
there's a lot of stuff up there but

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,159
really there's only a couple of relevant

44
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,658
things that add to the credibility of

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,850
why I might be standing on stage talking

46
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,460
about this stuff as a lovely Rebecca did

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:59,949
say I am an ex conventional military

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,809
intelligence person outside of what I do

49
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,429
which is mostly threat assessments or

50
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,520
critical infrastructure and financial

51
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:07,759
services

52
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,590
I am also the director of intelligence

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840
at Security Alliance and the associate

54
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,769
director of intelligence for Gartner in

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,730
a mere I love insider threat I really

56
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:22,610
like nation-state fusion warfare how

57
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,048
pew-pew comes together with ashish and

58
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,140
what's that going to look like in the

59
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:28,459
future that gets me excited I am in the

60
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,529
UK I'm a crest certified for

61
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,360
intelligence manager which allows me to

62
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,090
produce threat assessments for

63
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,319
government and for banking because in

64
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,730
the UK you have to be regulated to

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,510
toothfairy intelligence in a way to say

66
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,149
that's a good thing right this is gonna

67
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,340
set my tone for the speech this is a

68
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,650
wheel it is a very good wheel it is

69
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,959
attached to a beautiful motorcycle it

70
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,170
takes us places it works we designed the

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,329
wheel so why do we do things that are

72
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,518
not necessarily wheels why are we trying

73
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,049
to redefine the wheel when we have

74
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,880
things that are out there that have

75
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,040
worked for is over a very long period of

76
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,390
time and we've refined them and we've

77
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,980
worked on them and we've got good at

78
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,328
them most agencies have got good at them

79
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,798
why are we trying to design new things

80
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:15,980
there are new things that have come out

81
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,690
which have been fantastic I'm not going

82
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,459
to say anything about vendors but we

83
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,829
know there's multiple ways you can sell

84
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,420
things it really is the briefest history

85
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:28,430
of millet of intelligence you will ever

86
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,410
see but through from sanzu of course the

87
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,329
Middle Ages Queen Elizabeth in our

88
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,190
emissaries the Venetians and their

89
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,290
embassies and sending out their spies

90
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,310
the First World War the Great War the

91
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,940
Second World War

92
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,459
Cold War current insurgency operations

93
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,410
and through to cyber we've been using

94
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,889
these methodologies and these analytical

95
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,900
techniques and they work mostly and

96
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:54,709
they're pretty good so we need to try

97
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,250
and stick with them right so initially

98
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,799
there was a picture of mr. Putin on a

99
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,889
pug you know the little dogs that bark

100
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,450
too much however I was point it was

101
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,299
pointed out to me by a friend that

102
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,679
actually there's probably gu or FSB or

103
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,819
someone around at some point so I didn't

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,180
want to upset the Russians a little bit

105
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:16,880
too much so just so you know this is

106
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,120
photoshopped believe or not he doesn't

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,579
ride bears around the

108
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,560
in wilderness but he was riding a horse

109
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,020
like that so that's where it was stolen

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,820
from but the important thing for this

111
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,440
talk really is

112
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,290
please don't get hung up on the

113
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,969
assessment the talk is there to show you

114
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,729
a few different methodologies that we

115
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,190
use just to make you aware of them how

116
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:40,979
you can use them where they exist rather

117
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,160
than going you know you should just go

118
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,889
and go on a sans forensics 5 7 8 course

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,540
which I did this week with Rebecca and

120
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,990
Rob and they will go into detail of some

121
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,910
of the methodologies country X country X

122
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,440
can be anyone it's not the United States

123
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,090
of America could be France could be

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,850
Germany not the UK there we go

125
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,919
Kona plausibility I love pounds of

126
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,990
plausibility in fact I love all

127
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,789
analytical methodologies and that's why

128
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,860
I like conferences and summits because I

129
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:14,969
get to send on stages although this is

130
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,199
my son's cherry being popped because I

131
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,940
get to talk about things that I

132
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,620
genuinely am passionate about and I am

133
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,510
passionate about analytical methods

134
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,150
believe or not like I said I'm a bit of

135
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,810
a stranger person kinds of pause ability

136
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,388
what is it

137
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,150
it lets us identify drivers behind a

138
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,740
scenario or look at the drivers behind a

139
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,320
scenario or use drivers to help create a

140
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,080
scenario we then have assumptions that

141
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,810
we've made based on those drivers now it

142
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,430
doesn't matter what the drivers are I

143
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,610
always fall back to my training and I

144
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,479
use things like stemple's and pestle

145
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,460
hopefully there's a few not in the

146
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,570
audience if not things like political

147
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,919
social technological environmental legal

148
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,990
the rest throughout there and it looks

149
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,880
at the assumptions that are behind those

150
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,770
drivers that allow us to create a base

151
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,560
nice slaughter scenario and I think this

152
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,479
is fairly baseline you know Russia

153
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,860
continues to play upon internal

154
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,270
political divisions within both the

155
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,190
population and the government government

156
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,409
corporates we spend some money we spend

157
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,690
and just about enough money on cyber

158
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,979
security and security but we still get

159
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,570
breached we're not spending enough and

160
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,210
there's not enough legislation around it

161
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:24,139
social media remains just horrendous

162
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,190
leap or for getting rid of fake news

163
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,599
let's not forget the Russians are

164
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,719
demigods when it comes to information

165
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,090
operations and SIOP so they're just

166
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,070
keep manipulating that and the Russians

167
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,719
they're just gonna keep targeting NATO

168
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,840
NATO if they want NATO's destruction

169
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,280
pretty standard based on plaintiff pose

170
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,330
ability though he gets his looking at

171
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,039
some of those assumptions that we've

172
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,500
made and start swapping them out

173
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,140
thinking you know what this is pretty

174
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,400
standard but what happens if this isn't

175
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,830
what we think what happens if this

176
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,299
driver changes what happens if all of a

177
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,120
sudden the government starts putting

178
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,980
large fines or sending directors to jail

179
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,770
when there's big breaches of

180
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,830
confidential and sensitive information

181
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,450
one day and if things start to change

182
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,090
and it changes our scenarios and we're

183
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:13,180
looking for more plausible scenarios

184
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:16,599
you know Russian intrusion does continue

185
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:20,840
however what we're looking at here

186
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,040
because fake news is stopped others a TV

187
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,340
down here I didn't know that that's

188
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,340
helpful

189
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:30,020
Russians sorry they're social media fake

190
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,820
news generally they fall out of the

191
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,229
press we stop talking about them so much

192
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,909
they still continue doing what they're

193
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,140
doing in the backgrounds but we can

194
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,040
actually start concentrating on

195
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,690
different things as a nation we can then

196
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,100
take out some of those scenarios put

197
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,810
them back and we can come up with some

198
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,270
drivers or assumptions that are a little

199
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,850
bit more a little bit more out there so

200
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,109
country X the president decides we're

201
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,610
going to start playing hardball with

202
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,660
these this government with the Russians

203
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,040
we're going to get floud and they're

204
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,350
going to stick him in a box not

205
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,960
literally like but in a corner that's

206
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,970
what I should say we start doing some

207
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,770
offensive cyber operations we start

208
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:09,310
doing some really good information

209
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:12,799
operations ourselves all of a sudden

210
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,070
things change a little bit Russia's

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,990
economy becomes a little bit unstable

212
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,540
there's more pressure on mr. Putin for

213
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,979
the second time in eight years all of a

214
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,100
sudden his position starts to become a

215
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,349
little bit more untenable more kinetic

216
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,720
or more cyber operations commenced out

217
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,300
of the Russians out of country X out of

218
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,760
mate a bit of an information cold war

219
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,909
moving on so what is it really coastal

220
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,799
plausibility yes that was a strategic

221
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,689
question but it can absolutely be for

222
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,760
technical analysis as well if you're

223
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,670
creating attacked

224
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,230
these simulated attack scenarios or

225
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,760
anything like that you can start looking

226
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,020
at some of the scenarios which you think

227
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,550
you know you're probably going to go

228
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,439
with but start just pushing them out a

229
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,449
little bit and trying different areas

230
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,160
identify your drivers and your

231
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,470
assumptions but you can use it anywhere

232
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,469
in the or for any type of intelligence

233
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:10,510
bat casting another one I really love

234
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,640
bat casting so let's just take a snorer

235
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,790
we're a pharmaceutical company we've

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,850
been smashing all of our spare capital

237
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,099
into a new piece of IP a new drug

238
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,110
however that drug the the research that

239
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,340
goes behind it is sucked up by a large

240
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:29,530
nation that likes to steal IP and all of

241
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,570
a sudden the press become aware the

242
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,550
media our shareholders that all of this

243
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,220
investment that we've had he's

244
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,530
disappeared into our IP the IPS

245
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,720
disappeared and that merger with another

246
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,829
organization that we needed to do in

247
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,790
order to move into the market

248
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,770
effectively that's now done don't need

249
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,260
to worry about the assumptions this is a

250
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:53,340
story board now most of you will

251
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,720
recognize this bit but that's different

252
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,580
in a lot of the threat assessments we do

253
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,790
we do the move the likes of the Bank of

254
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,410
England's see best scheme and it's about

255
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,120
telling a story it's not always

256
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,980
technical you've got to get buy-in from

257
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,840
everyone now what's the exposition

258
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,880
what's creating this scenario of a

259
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,920
breach what's the rising action

260
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,439
what's the climax how does the breach

261
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,329
happen the falling acts and things that

262
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,730
start to happen in the denim or were the

263
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,470
things that come together what does that

264
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,880
look like now there's a big gap up there

265
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,350
between intrusion and exfiltration but

266
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,610
that's where that bit falls in that's

267
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,960
where they cut cyber killed trainers and

268
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,490
then once we're in the kill chain once

269
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,900
we're inside our network how does that

270
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,020
attack happen so bat casting what is it

271
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,780
effectively

272
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,430
it is taking an end event what is our

273
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,990
worst case scenario we've gone through

274
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,510
pairs of plausibility we've looked at

275
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,220
all our scenarios we've got all of these

276
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,590
scenarios but how are they gonna happen

277
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,490
you know series events have to happen

278
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,510
for an order for that IP server to be

279
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,949
breached

280
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:01,829
for the information to be leaked

281
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:01,829
whatever that's our end state not just

282
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,550
strategically not just from the story

283
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,320
point board point of view they've got to

284
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,000
find information the press have got to

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,740
find out all those kind of things are

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,490
things that have to happen but also

287
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,380
technically they get to a certain stage

288
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,000
of the network at this point

289
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,470
they'd have to escalate privileges in

290
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,690
order to do that they need compromise

291
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,389
this account oh it's okay because when

292
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,050
they get to this point is air-gapped not

293
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,910
gonna happen

294
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,899
well wildcards know what happens if they

295
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,969
do breach okay over the air gap somehow

296
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,160
so what is it really it's working from

297
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,839
an end point starting at the beginning

298
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,240
and it's identifying for the

299
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,459
conventional army military people in the

300
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,310
world your combat indicators your flags

301
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:47,380
in your signposts it's saying right

302
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,410
this has to happen this has to happen

303
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,990
and then if this happens oh and then

304
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,910
this happens okay we know what's

305
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,000
potentially going to happen here if this

306
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,980
and this happens then it's likely or

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,199
icer so it's likely that the target will

308
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,000
be going after this particular asset if

309
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:06,040
they go after this asset this is the

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,069
impact of that asset so it's a way of is

311
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,560
creating storyboards combat indicators

312
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:13,750
flags so we can start to identify things

313
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,339
sooner than we possibly already have

314
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,690
because we've already thought about them

315
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,730
we've already got a process it gives us

316
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,620
some new cases for the technical people

317
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,060
this is use cases that you can start

318
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,930
building into whatever technical

319
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,160
solution you use for analysts it's when

320
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,689
you're sitting there and you're hearing

321
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,699
things going on in the stock and you

322
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,760
like that that and that

323
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,139
yeah maybe we need to look at a few of

324
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,050
our scenarios and look at what could be

325
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:41,110
happening really it is very much like

326
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,180
CPA for those of that use sorry don't

327
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,839
know about critical path analysis it's

328
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,209
brilliant

329
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,550
especially for building attack trees or

330
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,989
simulated attack scenarios I haven't got

331
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,579
time to go through it unfortunately so

332
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,560
there is a QR code out there for you to

333
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,109
just take you through to wiki and it

334
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,888
explains it better than I can

335
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:02,529
that's for sure so bad casting yes is

336
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:05,260
always strategic it's good for those

337
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,120
things it's definitely operational I use

338
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,189
it particularly for tactical level

339
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,030
intelligence

340
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,250
we won't go into the difference between

341
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,400
technical technical tactical and

342
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,500
technical so we've been through claims

343
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,630
we found all are most likely attack

344
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,730
scenarios we've found all our most

345
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,470
dangerous courses of action from the

346
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,440
enemy we found all the scenarios in

347
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,870
between you need to back cast them all

348
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,340
have all them all out there know what

349
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,050
they are as an analyst you should know

350
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:37,030
them intimately ACH so a lot of you will

351
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,410
know you're a CA Qing you think oh I'm

352
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,110
just not gonna listen for a minute

353
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,880
I think blame you because this is the

354
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,580
one everyone's got on to write every

355
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,840
vendor ACH this is what you can do bla

356
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,670
bla like don't even understand it yeah

357
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,520
it can be prospective leo it can be user

358
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:59,829
respectively some specialist software is

359
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,840
available or Excel apparently which is

360
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,190
the world's greatest tool as we've all

361
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,750
learned this week do it in that but ACH

362
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,670
yes technically you can have your

363
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,530
different team members in there your

364
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,479
different language speakers your

365
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,260
different capabilities but you can do it

366
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,670
down and dirty at your desk this is what

367
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,050
I learned when I was in the mo D as a

368
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,310
desk level analyst when I haven't got a

369
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,449
big team around me and I need to make a

370
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,030
quick decision and I need some

371
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,610
hypothesis guidance down and dirty desk

372
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:31,600
level ACH it looks very much like normal

373
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,430
ACH but this is prospective we are

374
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,630
saying as slide hasn't quite worked out

375
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,339
apologies for that you can start big if

376
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,290
you need some guidance on who your

377
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,720
potential actors are you can start with

378
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,709
categories you can start with something

379
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,780
that looks like a threat matrix

380
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,400
capability opportunity intent things

381
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,620
like that and then start going down

382
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,750
smaller into smaller questions we

383
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,940
started with categories up here ACG

384
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,490
taxes hacktivists you can then move on

385
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,089
to individual nations individual actors

386
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:03,970
whatever you need to do so we can see

387
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,610
nation states proxies etc are the

388
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,960
highest scoring these guys still likely

389
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:14,200
just less likely and then as scoring for

390
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,430
those that don't know with ACH one of

391
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,680
the things you're looking for a standard

392
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,569
deviation in the scores the bigger the

393
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,888
standard deviation the more important

394
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,209
that piece of evidence is

395
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,769
it doesn't have to be evidence it can be

396
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,979
an assumption as well you just need to

397
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:28,269
state that it's an assumption and all of

398
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,439
sudden this piece of evidence becomes a

399
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,369
little bit more important because if

400
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,839
you've got a piece of evidence where

401
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:33,069
there's very little time the deviation

402
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,139
what's that really telling you does that

403
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:36,519
tell you anything not really doesn't

404
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,899
mean you delete it or get rid of it just

405
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,009
grayed out stick the pencil through it

406
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:42,279
but show it's in there show your working

407
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:43,959
china-russia

408
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,230
we've gone from groups we've now looked

409
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:49,599
at individual countries and then actors

410
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,359
within those countries but what about

411
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,259
retrospectively now this probably isn't

412
00:15:52,359 --> 00:16:00,399
really suited to desk level analysis

413
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:02,709
however generally it looks a bit like

414
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,410
this and this is where credibility comes

415
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:07,988
into a bit more into it a little bit

416
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,730
more if you've got an IP that has been

417
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:12,160
pulled out of a vendor report how

418
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,249
credible is that piece of evidence not

419
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,868
so much how credible it is your human

420
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:19,269
source within a hat to this group who

421
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:20,649
internally as great as as BT ie they

422
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,879
give us lots of intelligence that

423
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,489
usually is correct

424
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,169
that's gonna be a green if you have two

425
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:27,610
scores that are pretty similar and one

426
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:29,860
of those scores is mostly based around

427
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,199
Amber's and Reds versus the other one

428
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,759
that's mostly basic around greens that

429
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,579
is great you know you know which

430
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,149
direction you should be going in murder

431
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:41,979
boarding I love this so standing at the

432
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,319
back I heard a question towards the end

433
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,480
of Christians presentation about how do

434
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:49,209
you bring our panelists without

435
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,639
upsetting them and you know making them

436
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,469
sad and then having HR complain because

437
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,379
you were a little bit hard on them well

438
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,939
you're not welcome in my team there's no

439
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,529
other way it goes down so this was

440
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,329
actually taught to me by Squadron Leader

441
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,860
who was based in Washington for a while

442
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:05,198
and he learned this from an American

443
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,510
agency and I think it's fantastic ladies

444
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,130
and gentlemen as analysts if you've not

445
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,240
got the Knesset balls

446
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:15,209
yeah no can't say balls Kahuna's to

447
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,220
stand in front of your peers and say

448
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:21,220
this is my evidence these are my

449
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,679
assumptions this is my assessment now

450
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,899
rip me to pieces I need you to make this

451
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,059
right then you shouldn't be an analyst

452
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:29,949
an analyst job is to stand there you

453
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:33,090
there to protect your organization not

454
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,090
your ego right

455
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,299
stand there and say and let them pull it

456
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:43,149
them to pieces let them question

457
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,918
everything and that's only gonna make

458
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:46,629
you better this is a really good you can

459
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,429
still do QA and by the way this isn't

460
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:50,080
just necessarily about evidence this is

461
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:51,519
also about terminology because

462
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,840
terminology is so important why have you

463
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,369
use that word that word could mean

464
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,590
different things to different people

465
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:58,809
change that word that sentence makes no

466
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,330
saying that no sense flip it over

467
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,129
now it makes more sense 10th man is also

468
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,529
really important not have had anyone

469
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:09,939
heard of 10th man okay

470
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:11,289
so this really is a bit like motor

471
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,460
boarding a little bit less aggressive

472
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:16,960
unfortunately is somebody who's not been

473
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,820
involved with that piece of research or

474
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,159
that operation or that investigation

475
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,389
who's coming at this completely cold you

476
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,499
know the saying if you can't explain it

477
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,899
to a five-year-old you don't actually

478
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:27,909
understand it yourself this is sort of

479
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:29,918
the same sort of concept you bring in

480
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:32,289
somebody that asks questions with fresh

481
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,549
eyes somebody they don't have to be

482
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:38,379
cyber security IT security they could be

483
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:41,230
June in the kitchen who makes the tea on

484
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:43,899
a Thursday sometimes there's questioning

485
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:47,110
things in a different way is it's a good

486
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:50,110
thing horizon scanning right who's

487
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,758
responsible for building strategy who's

488
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,219
responsible for building architecture

489
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,259
there are not enough organizations who

490
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,240
are doing horizon scanning in the

491
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:00,610
conventional world what do we do we look

492
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,090
five ten and twenty five years over the

493
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,990
horizon we look at what the enemy is

494
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,850
developing we're going to look at what

495
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,070
the world is going to look like in the

496
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,860
cyber world were creating strategy in

497
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,418
architecture in three and five years you

498
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,029
need to look at you as an organization

499
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:20,019
where are you gonna be in three years

500
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:21,850
time how much have you expanded into

501
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:24,429
different geographical locations new

502
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,748
industries how BIG's your organization

503
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,190
what technologies are you going to use

504
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,330
what technologies are out there what's

505
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,559
your environment gonna look like what's

506
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,610
that enemy going to look like what's the

507
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,820
threat landscape going to look like

508
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,379
build your strategies of this you

509
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,570
shouldn't be taking a single point in

510
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:39,820
time as in what everything is now or

511
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,340
these are other technologies horizon

512
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,570
scanning should guide everything that

513
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,600
you do in both collection

514
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,999
and strategy but don't forget the basics

515
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,309
I mentioned my six notebooks

516
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:52,749
mr. stroll are you not here you'd be

517
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,009
proud of me and you'd want to adopt me

518
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:57,429
because I want him for my grandfather

519
00:19:54,009 --> 00:20:00,489
but you you need to draw link analysis

520
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:02,080
charts by the way you can't rely I have

521
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:04,479
a threat match portable sorry

522
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,639
an intelligent portal thing that I I

523
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,830
sell and stuff of the company that I

524
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:10,719
work for but you can't rely on people's

525
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,939
software to do link analysis for you I

526
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,899
was lucky enough to try a piece of

527
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,549
software here recently and I there was a

528
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:19,840
link between two groups which I thought

529
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:21,220
was really interesting because I know

530
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,699
who the group is and I know who they

531
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,830
attack somehow and we never I mean they

532
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,239
never attacked those guys and then I

533
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,710
looked at it and it's just because the

534
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,330
software who dissociated them as a

535
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,669
threat act or even though they well yeah

536
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,590
I suppose they are but then because of

537
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,389
that they automatically said that they

538
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,849
attacked them but they didn't because

539
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:41,918
they said they helped them so you can't

540
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:43,629
rely on software to make link analysis

541
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,249
for you if you're not she's not got

542
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,139
notebooks full of drawings or

543
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:48,639
whiteboards full of drawings as an

544
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:54,969
analyst don't think you can call

545
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:56,529
yourself an analyst and another basic

546
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,909
thing now we've covered this off a

547
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,169
couple of times Christian cover it off

548
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:01,149
as well

549
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,220
refining the question what's the

550
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:04,719
question you're answering why we

551
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,190
answering it sir

552
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,599
is that really the question what's the

553
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,249
answer that you're really looking for

554
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,769
what do you want to know what format do

555
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:13,539
you want to have it why Rob said it

556
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:15,970
really well why are you asking that

557
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:19,229
question you need to get into the

558
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,279
question and find out exactly why the

559
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:24,309
really important thing with that is

560
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,049
sometimes people don't know why they're

561
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,090
asking questions they just feel like

562
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:30,668
they should aren't asked a question we

563
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,199
get that a lot in boardrooms I have an

564
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,779
opinion I'm going to say it fire a

565
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,979
question make sure that the question is

566
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:41,470
actually right why is it we do this

567
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:43,029
what is this military people in the room

568
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,599
all know about intelligence preparation

569
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:49,720
at the battlefield right i PB two really

570
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,249
important words systemic continuous this

571
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,369
is what it is we're keeping our an eye

572
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:57,220
on the intelligence preparation and

573
00:21:54,369 --> 00:22:01,820
battlefield but what is it really

574
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:05,330
define the battlefield environment so

575
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,769
what do we look like to the enemy what

576
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,418
do we look like to ourselves what do we

577
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:10,340
know about our architecture what do our

578
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:11,899
employees look like what who are they

579
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,120
what does our supply chain look like who

580
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:15,379
do our partners interact with what do

581
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,969
they look like what's their threat

582
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:18,949
landscape what vulnerabilities have we

583
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,240
got what our assets with our critical

584
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,690
assets what are the really important

585
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,210
crown jewels where are they describe the

586
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,740
effect so again drivers you know what a

587
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,340
political effects are they're on our

588
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,320
environment

589
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,720
what technological effects are there

590
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,158
what legal effects are there how is the

591
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,899
battlefield defined the enemy what's

592
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,759
their capability what's their intent or

593
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,340
certain motivation why are they coming

594
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,080
after me what are their weapon systems

595
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,730
I'm not talking RPGs I'm talking what

596
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,769
malware do they use what tool sets do

597
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:53,749
these TTP's courses of action how are we

598
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:55,340
and the enemy coming together how are

599
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:59,480
they going to attack us what methods are

600
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,119
they going to use importantly well Flags

601
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,029
signposts I mentioned these earlier

602
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:07,820
what's the effect of the business during

603
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:09,559
a compromise this is our objective these

604
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,360
are our five pillars for our business

605
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:13,720
these are there are five objectives for

606
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,428
next year what's the impact on those

607
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,289
what's the impact on the share price to

608
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:23,299
our market understanding to press ladies

609
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,460
and gents if you can have an

610
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,200
understanding of yourself and that's

611
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,119
actually the hardest point most people

612
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,940
don't understand themselves if you can

613
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,309
understand the enemy as much as you can

614
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,289
and you can see how you will come

615
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:37,519
together in battle if you can understand

616
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,259
how you're going to be attacked and

617
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,909
breached you're actually doing a really

618
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:42,139
good job you're probably much further

619
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:44,330
down the maturity scale thing you

620
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:46,100
probably think that you are because a

621
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,360
lot of people don't understand this and

622
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,009
like I said in sunning yourself is

623
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,110
actually the hardest part bias I won't

624
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:57,230
go into this too much we we have spoken

625
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,869
about it but we all do have bias the

626
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,690
reason we use analytical techniques is

627
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:06,570
to try to remove as many of these bias

628
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:09,030
as much as possible bias biases

629
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,770
I've had many American versions of it in

630
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,170
the past five days but yeah we've got

631
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,840
them use analytical method it's murder

632
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:18,630
boarding whatever you need to do but you

633
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,730
need to be aware of those yes

634
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,720
intelligence without communication is

635
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,380
irrelevant

636
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:29,670
however when that communication of that

637
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,780
intelligence is using fluffy language

638
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,690
Christian and I are going to have a

639
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,770
conversation later on about

640
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,360
conversational language in reports I

641
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,800
come from a very different illah and a

642
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,129
very different background

643
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:44,430
however there's guides out there

644
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:47,400
we spoke Rob mentioned The Economist

645
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:50,130
style guide which is fantastic the CIA

646
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,710
wrote a style guide take people style

647
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,840
guides write your own style guide

648
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,780
internally disseminate it and stick to

649
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,970
it it's really important because people

650
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,740
have got to know consistently what you

651
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,290
mean using the same style of language

652
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,850
all the time is one of the most

653
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:09,870
important things you can do when you're

654
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:12,659
disseminating a product terminology is

655
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:15,479
critical in this I use the uncertainty

656
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,030
yardstick most if NATO does plausibility

657
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,910
yardstick to some people if you use

658
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,500
something like this keep using it in all

659
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,240
of my reports I usually have a few pages

660
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,160
that talks about terminologies but if

661
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,350
it's just an in grep it's a one pager I

662
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,570
put this in size eight in gray at the

663
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,280
bottom just so they know what I mean

664
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,570
there's always a constant reference to

665
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,250
and they understand the difference

666
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,500
between what's likely and what's

667
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:41,490
unlikely what's highly likely versus

668
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,900
it's almost certain because at the end

669
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,000
of the day we're trying to make things

670
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,680
that are relevant to all of our

671
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,940
audiences so they always know what

672
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,120
they're talking about when I say

673
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:56,550
commanders of all levels managers

674
00:25:50,120 --> 00:26:01,199
c-suite c-suite cxos analysts I like one

675
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:02,760
final point obviously Christian did a

676
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,820
much better job so I'm not going to

677
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,020
really hone on about it but my two big

678
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:12,240
things brevity just say it get it to the

679
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,850
point and importantly after you've said

680
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,160
it so what what does that mean to you

681
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,469
and remember your audience Christian

682
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,960
made a really really clear what does it

683
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,930
mean to the

684
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,420
cxa what does it mean to the CFO the CRO

685
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:27,040
whoever needs to see that report what

686
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,330
does it mean to that analysts what does

687
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,820
it mean to the managers what does it

688
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,010
mean to the employees always got to have

689
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,270
a so what if there's no so what it's not

690
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,270
an intelligent product at all

691
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,729
