00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,820
[Music]

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,900
so as I go saying my name is jeremy

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,160
johnson and i'm a cyber threat

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,920
intelligence analyst at Ford Motor

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,560
Company previous to that I was in our

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,900
detecting center in her sock and working

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,939
there but if you'll indulge me for a

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,400
moment I'd like to talk about one of my

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,009
other passion for a brief moment

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,129
photography so this is a picture that I

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,140
took back on a trip last October to

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,719
Scotland my wife and I were driving

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,579
around the isle mall which is one of the

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,100
variety and Isles on the west side

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:48,300
country and we ran across these two

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,739
shipwrecked or beached boat and really

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,839
throughout the entire trip this is

19
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,129
probably my favorite pictures and I just

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,629
want to take a moment I haven't this is

21
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,620
the biggest i've seen it it's actually

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,440
pretty cool but like most photographers

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,860
one of the things i tried to reduce or

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,408
minimize in my photos is noise so what

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,119
is noise it's something that is kind of

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,380
annoying to deal with and it happens

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,080
when you're shooting in lower light and

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,449
what it looks like they took in that

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,130
picture it's not you'll notice it's not

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,930
really a smooth gradient they're sick

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,289
there's some dots they don't quite add

32
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,090
up or they don't quite fit but when you

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,320
look at the entire picture it still

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,960
works so a bit of history about this

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,419
texture this is Bob Moore you might know

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,119
them from bob's red mill and you might

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,250
know Bob's Red Mill from all those

38
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,619
plastic bags you see and like the bakery

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,890
not or baking aisle or the grocer's that

40
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:47,130
grocery cereal aisle and this was taken

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,060
at d Golden's fertile which is the world

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,740
championship of porridge so completely

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,399
random event but we something across it

44
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,610
was pretty cool I'd porch with squid ink

45
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,860
it's crazy stuff anyways I could use

46
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,750
this picture alright I couldn't really

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,270
use this picture and blow it up really

48
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,750
big the noise is going to have too much

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,290
of an impact and when I build my shrine

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,670
to the patron saint of porridge

51
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,429
I'll have to use a smaller picture

52
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,500
something like an 8 by 10 or a 4 by 6 to

53
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,290
help minimize the effect the overall

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,189
noise has and indicators are really the

55
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,709
same way not all indicators are perfect

56
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,269
one hundred percent you know we're going

57
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,349
to fire off an offense or fire off an

58
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:36,590
instant right away and also like

59
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,790
indicators are like my vacation photos

60
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,250
there's too many indicators and not

61
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,069
enough time so there are millions of

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:48,180
feeds out there paid unpaid open source

63
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,040
type Intel and part of my job is making

64
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,129
sure that we bring the most relevant

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,929
stuff into our company and even then

66
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,099
even when we pare down to the relevant

67
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,780
stuff a lot of these indicators have you

68
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,268
know there's noise or as false positives

69
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,919
that we have to deal with and the lower

70
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,659
fidelity ones give us kind of a quandary

71
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,090
it's we deal with the the noise that

72
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:14,220
they introduced into our system or do we

73
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,659
miss the opportunity to detect that

74
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,659
weirdness altogether and when it comes

75
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,069
down to it from a practical standpoint

76
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,828
some noise is going to be acceptable you

77
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,679
can't really deal with an indicator or

78
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,720
you never get everything that's 100% and

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,729
if you do have something at one hundred

80
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,239
percent think of all the stuff that

81
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:38,669
you're probably missing and the flip

82
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,829
side of that though too much noise will

83
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:43,139
flood your stock and coming from the

84
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,819
detection role I can tell you it's not

85
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,260
just about having your detectors

86
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,569
complaining about being too busy it's

87
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,739
actually a lot more insidious than that

88
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,839
and when they first started or when we

89
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,669
first turned on our sim we had this rule

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,430
that would fire that was for excessive

91
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,859
firewall denied and it would catch one

92
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,359
of three things either catch

93
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:06,959
unauthorized software misconfigured

94
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,239
software or actual malware however when

95
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
you deploy that rule across an

96
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,729
enterprise of 100-plus thousand end

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,190
point you're going to have a lot of

98
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,789
noise and we were getting about four or

99
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,620
five hundred hits a day at first and the

100
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,690
real impact of this isn't just wasting

101
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,290
time it's the fact that every time we

102
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,640
looked at one of those alerts

103
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:33,100
and our perception of it was biased so

104
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,789
bias isn't just an issue with the Intel

105
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:42,490
side of things if it can be passed down

106
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:44,710
to other key on your sock and really

107
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,000
it's a terrible place to be just to

108
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,690
automatically assume that this is going

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,970
to be a false positive so how do we

110
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,010
reduce that noise and how do we still

111
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,550
try to find a way of keeping some these

112
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,080
lower fidelity indicators in fact why do

113
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,830
we even want to really bother with these

114
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,330
little fidelity indicators so cuz I'm

115
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,310
talking about high fidelity oil fidelity

116
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,169
and all that I just kind of wanted to

117
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,790
draw some arbitrary lines in the sand

118
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,500
and it's through what these are these

119
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,390
are completely arbitrary numbers just

120
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,230
for the sake of argument you can

121
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,000
probably go back to your own

122
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,670
environments and do some cool math or

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,100
statistics or science and get better

124
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,380
numbers for this but for the sake of

125
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,870
argument anything above seventy percent

126
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm gonna stay at high fidelity anything

127
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,800
between that and forty percent is like a

128
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:35,970
medium fidelity sort of rule or IOC and

129
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,400
anything below 40 is just low fidelity

130
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,620
so why do we even want to bother using

131
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,940
assault fidelity indicators are they

132
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,860
aren't they just an indicator of

133
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,050
exhaustion something that makes our sock

134
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,580
hate us that much more no they don't

135
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:55,590
have to be what we can do is take these

136
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:59,140
i/o fees and apply them surgically and

137
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,090
one one example that I heard and I can't

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,919
take credit for this this was um this is

139
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,619
something Rob Lee said yes that's

140
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,370
probably with the hair or little Rob I

141
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,960
think it's eclectic way of saying it but

142
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,090
being in your industrial control system

143
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,940
environment if you see Bing coming from

144
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,669
a PLC there's probably something fishy

145
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,590
going on there but if you see Bing in

146
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,150
your corporate environment it really

147
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,909
just means somebody hasn't heard of

148
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:30,250
google and then to go back to the

149
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,920
example of the firewall denied if you

150
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,260
were if we could could have taken that

151
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,630
rule and suck it on just our executive

152
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,480
machines for example we probably have

153
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,159
gotten a lot more value out of it

154
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,860
because it you know that the two things

155
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,810
that would catch it most of unauthorized

156
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,450
misconfigured software would have been

157
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,680
much less of an issue at that level they

158
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,539
have bigger or they've got better

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,770
machines or better manage machines at

160
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:00,700
least and they tend to do less weird

161
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,680
stuff but the issue with applying things

162
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,690
surgical you and trying to pair all the

163
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,490
stuff down and everybody likes to feel

164
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:12,300
special and that's not one of my

165
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:14,410
pictures sadly staff photography but

166
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,150
some roles are going to be more

167
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,020
important to the overall business than

168
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,520
others and this is coming from a private

169
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,659
enterprise perspective so I mean

170
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,900
government might be a little bit

171
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,160
different but not everybody really

172
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,359
contributes to the business equaling

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,910
there are certain applications or

174
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,540
certain infrastructure that if it goes

175
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:41,760
down your company is now losing money or

176
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:45,460
reputation or it just can't function and

177
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,700
when you really pare it down critical

178
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,890
assets are only a fraction of the

179
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,890
overall assets of your business and

180
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,810
those are the special people that we

181
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,480
really want to protect so why do we take

182
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,070
these high-value assets and these lower

183
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,850
fidelity indicators and merge them

184
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:09,010
together so much like with the picture

185
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,870
you know the 4 x 6 is going to have less

186
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,880
issue its noise it's still the same

187
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,070
picture as you know something the size

188
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,500
of a poster but the noise just less

189
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,020
noticeable and what this is allowing us

190
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,729
to do is always to still keep some of

191
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,580
the detection opportunities in our

192
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:28,030
environment and it's helping reduce the

193
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,789
overall noise but Martha was making sure

194
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,370
that the stuff that's business-critical

195
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,349
still has it has more monitoring than

196
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,000
your average asset so we're still trying

197
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,169
to make sure that the important stuff is

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,110
watched to a higher

199
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:45,939
degrees in your average person so I know

200
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,790
that you know there's lots of diagrams

201
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,700
and everybody has a pyramid or a cone or

202
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:56,790
something or a chain this is my pyramid

203
00:08:51,700 --> 00:09:01,779
this is a pyramid of importance and it's

204
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:05,139
pure MIDI but there's three different

205
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:06,760
types of categories that can go into

206
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:08,980
this you might have some additional ones

207
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,010
or something kind of fits in but the

208
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,079
first group is important knowledge so

209
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,050
these are your executives or your

210
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,630
engineers people who have the strategic

211
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,029
business knowledge or maybe the

212
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,829
intellectual property that we're gonna

213
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,930
trade secrets said you know really makes

214
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:28,599
your company shine out a booger

215
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,609
competition and then under executive

216
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,570
it's all sort of noting you know you

217
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,790
might want to put your executive

218
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:37,149
assistants because really they're part

219
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,920
of the ones running the show anyways the

220
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,170
people who have some sort of heightened

221
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,040
to access so these are going to be your

222
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,360
network admins database admins even your

223
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,610
help desk you know if your help desk

224
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,290
people have elevated rug or elevated

225
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,050
permissions you know there's other

226
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,910
things that adversaries will go for so

227
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,189
they've got higher access in your

228
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:00,819
network you want to keep a little bit

229
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,640
closer eye out and then business

230
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,630
critical infrastructure so if you've got

231
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,980
applications and you could go off of

232
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,399
stuff that has like you know it's going

233
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,110
to use the confidentiality integrity

234
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,570
availability triad if anything has a

235
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,920
three in one of those categories you

236
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,410
might want to stick it in and watch for

237
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,680
it because you know it's obviously some

238
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,240
sort of important but then and this is

239
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,640
coming home this is private of my bias

240
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,800
because I work for a small family on

241
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,540
manufacturing company is IC s devices so

242
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,579
you know if you've got plants or

243
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,560
something like that you want to make

244
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,829
sure that your plants keep pumping out

245
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,750
whatever your product is and one thing I

246
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:46,060
didn't put on this slide but it's still

247
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,550
probably worth noting is the idea of

248
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,579
like high-risk access

249
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,709
so when this point guys yesterday were

250
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,800
talking about taking people who had

251
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:59,079
failed like the fishing test they click

252
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,550
the link now they're on the list you

253
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,800
could use that as the way of saying you

254
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,569
know this person is shown risky behavior

255
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,269
in the past let's watch them a little

256
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:10,750
bit closer or if you've had incidents

257
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:13,470
that involve certain people you might

258
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,140
wanna watch them closer as well but then

259
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:20,200
on the infrastructure side we can look

260
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,689
at stuff like legacy software because I

261
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,209
mean who doesn't have legacy software in

262
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,240
the network at some point where do we

263
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,739
get all this information and we've got a

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,130
really look deep inside ourselves to

265
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:36,579
find it and Rob Darnell did an awesome

266
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:41,290
job about talking about knowing yourself

267
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:44,199
and you really want to understand where

268
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,870
you're I guess not i sir just for your

269
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,720
weak points are but where your important

270
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:54,520
parts are so for your information all

271
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,930
that is and to do this you know first

272
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,810
you want to start for with people

273
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,140
talking to your HR folks or your HR

274
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:04,899
systems something like that to help get

275
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,760
groups of people or release names of

276
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,339
stuff that's important your risk

277
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,630
management folks might be a good place

278
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:15,250
to start as well they'll probably have

279
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:18,310
ideas with different ideas than you

280
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,350
about what is riskier to the company and

281
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,910
if you're fortunate to have something

282
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,579
like a governance risk and compliance

283
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,790
platform a lot of that information might

284
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:31,829
already be out there for you fun fact

285
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:34,599
I'm in that picture somewhere an

286
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:36,430
infrastructure side so if you've got to

287
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,980
change management database or an

288
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,420
application database those are good

289
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,490
places to start grabbing information

290
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,279
about what might be sensitive or what

291
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,630
might be critical and again going back

292
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,730
and talking to the risk management

293
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:53,920
people they might have different ideas

294
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:57,339
of locations or applications that they

295
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,689
see is risky and one thing we're keeping

296
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,370
in mind while you're searching for all

297
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,540
this information

298
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,279
and it's equally important as the

299
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,199
information you're looking for is where

300
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,870
you are finding it because this isn't

301
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,160
going to be a one-time exercise you're

302
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,260
going to want to make sure that you do

303
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,860
this constantly I mean it might start

304
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:18,880
out as a once-a-year exercise but as

305
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,220
time goes on things change so you know

306
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,880
executives are going to come executives

307
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,070
are going to go it's the same with you

308
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,510
know engineers helpdesk all the stuff

309
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,080
has turnover and applications as well

310
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,750
applications will be deployed

311
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:39,490
applications sometimes you actually just

312
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:41,560
commit disc commissioned but you want to

313
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,920
start paring down the cadence as much as

314
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:49,630
you can so from a year we exercise but

315
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,860
maybe quarterly maybe to monthly it's

316
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,420
really something that you know the

317
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,990
fresher information you get the better

318
00:13:52,420 --> 00:14:02,469
off you are so now this is the idea of

319
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:04,540
heightened monitoring what we're going

320
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,000
to do is now that we have some sort of

321
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,319
tears and our pyramid of importance you

322
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,140
want to take indicators and assign them

323
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,500
to them so are most here is going to be

324
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,300
our baseline and I was talking to

325
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,400
somebody and they gave me the idea of

326
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,560
talking about fantasy football and they

327
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,470
gave me get the terms of floaters and

328
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,760
flyers i think it was i don't know i'm

329
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,520
absolutely terrible at fantasy football

330
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,370
we did a league last year and the only

331
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,930
reasons that i exceeded the expectations

332
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:35,080
was because the expectation was i was

333
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:39,520
going to come in dead last i came in 11

334
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,500
which is second to last anyways so with

335
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,660
floaters it's something that's going to

336
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,279
provide you a little bit of value or a

337
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,319
little bit of points in fantasy football

338
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,500
isn't planned and it's going to be a

339
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,610
consistently it something consistent but

340
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,290
not necessarily going to be

341
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,880
groundbreaking then you've got your

342
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,839
flyers which are going to give you

343
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,910
something to us often but it's gonna be

344
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,810
more groundbreaking when it does and so

345
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,709
those are the ones that you want to

346
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,510
stick in your higher tiers that way it's

347
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:10,209
you're having to deal with less overall

348
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,830
noise in the system and there are some

349
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,030
tools that can help you out with this

350
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,800
so if you have a threat intelligence

351
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,370
platform something you can stick these

352
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,349
indicators in and like Robbie was saying

353
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,900
this morning you want to have some

354
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,300
context if you just stick a domain in

355
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,390
and say this is bad not really worth

356
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,380
doing but beyond just the context

357
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,650
they'll help you keep track of the

358
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,110
confidence or the severity of the actual

359
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,550
indicator then when it comes time to

360
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,520
actually doing a lot of this action

361
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,079
having a sim and I realize I'm probably

362
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,600
preaching to the choir here a sim is

363
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,450
pretty much essential to do this and

364
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,100
then a case management system something

365
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,100
that we can use to keep track of our

366
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,380
notes I know we had to talk today on

367
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,540
notes and keeping track of all the

368
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,340
information for incidents this is

369
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,050
actually a real good place to keep track

370
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,870
of it it's something you know hopefully

371
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,670
you can do some searching but more than

372
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:11,990
just that you can keep metrics on the

373
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:18,949
indicators as you see them so what does

374
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:20,600
this look like in practice and it's like

375
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,130
a quick example I'm going to say that

376
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,760
we've got three different ilcs or three

377
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,920
rules we've got a high fidelity domain

378
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,200
we've got some an idea through its now I

379
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,390
quit all the road to fidelity we've got

380
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,400
a sim rule that sometimes heald's us

381
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,920
really good results but most of the time

382
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,840
it falls kind of flat and we're going to

383
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,969
say that there's three tiers in our

384
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,100
pyramid of importance so you've got your

385
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,620
general users or you know with the

386
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,930
baseline then we're going to glom admins

387
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,090
and product designers together and then

388
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:54,170
at the very top we're going to put our

389
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:55,850
executives and I'm going to apologize

390
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,120
because while I like to consider myself

391
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,030
a good photographer I'm not good at

392
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,850
PowerPoint and design and graphs so if

393
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:08,050
anybody afterwards has a better way of

394
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,040
diagramming this please let me know it

395
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,948
what I was really trying to go for it

396
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:18,409
was as the value of an asset goes down

397
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:20,720
there watched by less rules and yeah we

398
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,150
read a joke in our inner socks that for

399
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,860
every Power Point skill you learn you

400
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,650
lose a technical skill

401
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,889
and and the guy who told me this is

402
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,929
going for an MBA so nothing else

403
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,120
business majors but I just want him to

404
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,290
know that I made that joke while he

405
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,428
wasn't here when he watches the player

406
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,350
anyways we're going to take our high

407
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,150
fidelity domain and we're going to stick

408
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,290
it at the very bottom so it's going to

409
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,970
be our floater it can be the thing that

410
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:52,200
gives us consistent value and it's

411
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,090
really the thing that everybody is going

412
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,510
to be watched by so we're going to take

413
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,159
our medium fidelity that IDs rule and

414
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,990
we're going to ignore your general users

415
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,070
we're going to watch our product

416
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,510
designers and our executives with it so

417
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,189
then we're going to take that low value

418
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,890
sim rule or not well valuable fidelity

419
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,410
and because we want to make sure that

420
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,730
it's the one of us can always possible

421
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:20,100
we're going to stick that at the very

422
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:22,010
top so I'll just talk about indicators

423
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,909
it was prior worth mentioning that

424
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:29,129
there's going to be some sort of life

425
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:30,990
cycle of fees and this is Isle of Skye

426
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,390
walking back from the ferry pools at

427
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,100
about sunset on the finger of any I'll

428
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:39,650
sky amazing you should go at least twice

429
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:43,189
but whenever you get an indicator in

430
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,750
ideal you want to do some testing and

431
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,520
what we've done in the past is we've

432
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,870
taken indicators and we've throw them

433
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,389
against our own walks like we'll look

434
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,820
back about 30 days see how often it

435
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,620
shows up and if it's below a certain

436
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,590
number and that number can really vary

437
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,899
depending on your environment if it's

438
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,110
both at certain number we say okay this

439
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,820
is this is uncommon enough if somebody

440
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,678
else is saying it's bad it's prior worth

441
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,330
always did investigation if it's

442
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,910
something above that magic number we go

443
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,460
back in and do some work we actually go

444
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:17,640
and see is this going to be an indicator

445
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,280
that's valid or an indicator that's just

446
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,690
going to be noise and I think a good

447
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,520
example of why do you would want to test

448
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,710
indicators would be the Grizzlies step

449
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,620
report like how many people just threw

450
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,940
that in near sim and said fire and see

451
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,178
what's come you know give me give me

452
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,480
what you got I know we did and it kind

453
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,480
of sucked

454
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,700
but live and learn right so had we done

455
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,830
testing on that we've been able to tell

456
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,050
that you know there's there's gonna be

457
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:50,770
some stuff that might be good some stuff

458
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,210
that might be bad and the next step you

459
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,889
throw in production you watch for it

460
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,000
this is probably most boring bullet

461
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,390
point I've got nothing else will say

462
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,070
about pad but while you're while it's in

463
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,560
production you want to make sure you're

464
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,860
tracking the trek in the fidelity of the

465
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,270
indicator or the rule so is it is

466
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,189
something that's given you values at

467
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,500
higher fidelity is at lower fidelity and

468
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,470
you can use this as a way of gauging

469
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,660
where it should sit in your cheers and

470
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,930
then how long do you actually want to

471
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:24,130
keep it so IP addresses can change

472
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:28,570
domains can change well get going you

473
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,160
know our domain but if an indica tan up

474
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,560
an IP addressing it was you were told

475
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,020
this was bad last year obviously it's

476
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,810
not going to be good now or it's likely

477
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,410
a good indicator now and not not to beat

478
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,340
up on a dead bear but grizzly stuff some

479
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,650
of those might have been valid

480
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:50,790
indicators at the time and if you know

481
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:53,920
how long they were being used for

482
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,620
basically the main point here keep

483
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,480
indicators for as long as they're useful

484
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,979
what we've done in the past is if we've

485
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,160
seen it if we've got indicators that

486
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,500
like an IP address is bad if we see it

487
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,080
we hold on to them if we don't see it in

488
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:12,970
30 days we assume okay this is probably

489
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,409
a dead IP and to keep Hilda's going

490
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:18,160
there's going to be some maintenance

491
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:20,320
involved there's you're going to have

492
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,050
new indicators to bring in and how you

493
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,510
manage that is going to vary do you want

494
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,850
to start from the bottom bottom tier and

495
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,350
your baseline and graduate indicators up

496
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,840
or do you want to stick indicators that

497
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,990
you're very top and bring them down as

498
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,870
time goes on and there's pros and cons

499
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,610
of both with both approaches if you

500
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,530
start from the bottom up there could be

501
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,560
some temporary noise or something you

502
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:47,530
have to deal with until you get it to

503
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,820
the right level if you start from the

504
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,600
top down you're missing

505
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,970
opportunity to detect things and it's a

506
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,939
harder question of when to move it down

507
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,490
least in my opinion so my personal

508
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,409
suggestion and this is my belief is I

509
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,029
was always I was always start from the

510
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:06,190
bottom up and just deal with the

511
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:09,159
temporary noise it probably a lot easier

512
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,720
to do that doesn't explain why you why

513
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,130
this particular indicator didn't

514
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,899
actually fire when it was actually your

515
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:19,120
environment but I brought up before you

516
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:21,008
know keeping track of previous

517
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,739
indicators and the fidelity of those and

518
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:27,029
we need to make maintain the older

519
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,710
indicators as well so as time goes on

520
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:34,269
the fidelity or the confidence level

521
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:36,639
might change IPS might switch from bad

522
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,820
to good especially if it's in like some

523
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:42,789
sort of hosting environment like GoDaddy

524
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:45,850
and assets can change too so as I

525
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:48,210
mentioned previously something like you

526
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,959
know people get fired people get hired

527
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,110
applications come and go that sort of

528
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,559
thing and automation is to be one of

529
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:59,620
those areas that really helps out so the

530
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,629
more automation you can do the less like

531
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,860
a leg work or monkey and you have to do

532
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:11,049
yourself the better what life will be

533
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:13,299
and the next four slides I tell them

534
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,860
potential speed bumps and I honestly

535
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:18,158
really struggled with what I should

536
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:21,580
title these because these are speed

537
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,070
bumps but at the same time these are

538
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:29,408
four areas that you can really improve

539
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:31,600
your sock as a whole and I don't want to

540
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:33,279
call them means to an end I really think

541
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,000
in this case the means probably justify

542
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:40,720
themselves but the first one is missing

543
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,840
internal context so it it's partially

544
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,419
identifying information so who is behind

545
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,399
that particular IP address so if you

546
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:51,250
have a firewall log how will I know if

547
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:52,658
that's an executive device or if I see

548
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,549
some sort of av log and I want to

549
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,740
investigate that how do I know it

550
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,210
belongs to an admin I mean these are

551
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,159
things that you have to investigate your

552
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,639
logs figure out what data points you can

553
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,070
hook into and then

554
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:07,218
what data you need to feed into your sim

555
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,968
but then beyond just the information

556
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:13,070
your logs who actually is important if

557
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:15,409
you can't tell me you know what would

558
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,239
what applications are important in what

559
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:20,149
IP address is the server's might sit on

560
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:22,639
it it doesn't really help me too much I

561
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:30,639
need the tactical information to really

562
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:35,539
run with us and kind of in the same vein

563
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:37,099
is a lack of visibility so if you're

564
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,959
completely missing dog sources so if you

565
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,908
even have antivirus logs or firewall

566
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:43,099
logs in your sim you're never going to

567
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:45,139
see it and so these are things that you

568
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:47,708
know as you go through it you need to

569
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:50,508
identify and start to work to correct

570
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:52,219
otherwise like I'm not observing traffic

571
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:54,440
so if you don't have net flow data where

572
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:56,809
it would be useful you won't look into

573
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,539
trying to get that or if you've got

574
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:01,219
sensors or something where you've got an

575
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,289
IDs that's placed right outside your

576
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:05,450
border and you're not going to see

577
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:09,399
internal IP addresses that might be

578
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:12,940
something worth looking to as well and

579
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:16,059
I've said automation a few times and

580
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,409
it's it's something that I guess I

581
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:21,079
wouldn't really say it's nice it's

582
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,999
really more of a necessity because when

583
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:24,379
it comes down to it we sin the company

584
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:26,359
might sighs there's a lot of

585
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:28,668
informational or a lot of information

586
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,489
that really has to start flowing and

587
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:33,619
it's too much that you really can't just

588
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,969
do it manually if you're going to you're

589
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,458
going to burn your own people out by

590
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:41,059
just shuffling around papers or digital

591
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:43,369
papers so if you want to redo this

592
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:45,619
successfully it automates the

593
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:46,939
information gathering so when you're

594
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,529
gathering all this information the first

595
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,019
time keep track of where you're doing it

596
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:52,339
try to find opportunities or like api's

597
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:55,039
or something like that you can hook into

598
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:57,200
or if it's some sort of homegrown

599
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,519
application that's even better cuz you

600
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,469
can talk to the developers and see if

601
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:05,570
you can get api's baked in for you and

602
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:08,149
the last speed bump is not having a

603
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:11,329
feedback loop so you want to use

604
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,320
indicator metrics and tie those to the

605
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:14,840
tears

606
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,100
if you're not doing that you might have

607
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,509
a bad indicator on your baseline and I

608
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,480
mean what words they go from there you

609
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:24,889
throw it out you like you need to have

610
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,169
some sort of feedback in order to really

611
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:29,029
judge these things properly and case

612
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,490
management systems are awesome if

613
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:33,529
something helped keep track of not only

614
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:39,110
the metrics behind it but the historical

615
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:41,230
data so in conclusion or fidelity ioc's

616
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,189
can be useful when you target them

617
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,100
however there's going to be some

618
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,580
assembly that's required and maintenance

619
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:53,209
is going to be a fact of life but

620
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:55,158
automation will save you but out of

621
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,850
everything I've said if there's one

622
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,820
particular piece of knowledge or advice

623
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,230
or wisdom I can leave you with it would

624
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,330
be it's not the fidelity of the

625
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,539
indicator that matters it's how you use

626
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,539
it

627
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,679
