00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,820
[Music]

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,359
so as Mike so kindly said without a

4
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,429
guitar I am pulling on their head right

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,650
Osada this is Brian Bartholomew is my

6
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:22,900
partner in crime and we're gonna talk

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,038
about false flags today and let me take

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,959
a minute just to say you know thanks

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,599
hands and this is my first hands as well

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,979
so I'm fairly excited to be here but

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,479
also I'd like to change the tone a

12
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:34,390
little bit because I've heard everybody

13
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:40,989
be extremely encouraging over the past

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:42,879
you know take okay in a bit and no no so

15
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:44,620
it's great to bring everybody in and

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,750
especially people who are doing IR and

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,078
and differ in general who might not be

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:52,149
as familiar with red intel generation we

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,670
want you guys to come on board we want

20
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,870
everybody to get into threat until

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,629
generation as best they can and

22
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,269
consumption in a wise way and not just

23
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:02,649
data feeds but actual context and to be

24
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,379
able to understand what these operations

25
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,440
are what they're doing but there's also

26
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,490
a thorny side to that so I want to you

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,050
know kind of put a damper on the

28
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,270
optimism just a little bit in order to

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,470
get a sense of realism of some of the

30
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,170
pitfalls that are out there some of the

31
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:20,289
troubles that are there as we start this

32
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:23,020
just keep in mind there is a 22 page

33
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,450
paper I think they cut that down to ten

34
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,820
by like formatting on this so we

35
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,320
released a few months ago just in case

36
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,639
you want some more details or you want

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,369
to actually get a sense of some of the

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,500
specifics but with that for those of you

39
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,670
that might not know we're from the great

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,200
team from the global research and

41
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,950
analysis team kaspersky you may have

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,780
heard several jobs at us yesterday it's

43
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,160
all in good fun we have a lot of fun

44
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,100
with it and I'll be more than happy to

45
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,740
show you my my ruse glish accent after

46
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,630
all this is very well practiced but more

47
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,410
importantly what the great team does is

48
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,929
specifically threat Intel generation at

49
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,160
a high level and that we get to have a

50
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,350
lot of fun with it we're tracking about

51
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,300
upwards of a hundred different threat

52
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,669
actors mostly on the espionage side

53
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,139
right now so for those of you that might

54
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,630
not be familiar this is more or less a

55
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,670
tree of some of the discovery starting

56
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,250
from 2010 as you can see starts getting

57
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,280
exponentially

58
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,350
bigger and that doesn't even include

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,210
2016 or 2017 where we've added a lot of

60
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,560
new threat actors in there and some

61
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,170
fairly interesting ones that we no

62
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,880
longer publicly discuss quite as easily

63
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,230
which is a little sad for me on the

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,780
researcher but the point here is that

65
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,190
we've been on the in the right place to

66
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,170
kind of understand how attribution

67
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,850
should and shouldn't be done and we'd

68
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,489
like to be able to focus on that instead

69
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,280
of continuing to talk about the

70
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,430
possibility of false flags and this sort

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,350
of sense of you can't be sure of what

72
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,209
you might be seeing because everything

73
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,340
could be planted because everything is

74
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,350
not quite right so you never really come

75
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,580
up with an attribution claim where

76
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,290
attribution agnostic we're gonna

77
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,489
continue to be attribution agnostic for

78
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,489
reasons that I think are gonna become

79
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,620
exceedingly clear as we talk about this

80
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,690
but that's not to say that you shouldn't

81
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,980
understand the parameters within which

82
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,320
you can do a certain amount of

83
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,899
attribution what you are basing it on

84
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,120
and where those specific things fail you

85
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,130
so let's get into the specifics let's

86
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,790
get into the weeds and kind of work on

87
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,230
that a little bit so yeah let's start by

88
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,109
talking about attribution and why it's

89
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,030
an issue so it was just mentioned the

90
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,750
last two presentations actually about

91
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,299
training a lot of us come from hopefully

92
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,799
in this room governed with background

93
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:37,790
intelligence background or at least a

94
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,320
good portion of us in in that world you

95
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,109
know a lot of us have received training

96
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,019
on how to be intelligence analysts

97
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,269
unfortunately with the advent in the you

98
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,489
know the increase in private sector and

99
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,930
vendors producing intelligence we

100
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:55,940
haven't actually created a good training

101
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,590
curriculum for people on there or

102
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,350
boarding to actually understand how to

103
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,760
actually do attribution so I know that's

104
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,820
being done now but it's in its infancy

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,980
stages major problem just to go through

106
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,350
a couple other ones here reputation I

107
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,850
tend to kind of harp on a little bit

108
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,320
there's some vendors out there that feel

109
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,750
like they need to build some street cred

110
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,690
and unfortunately when they want to do

111
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,750
this they tend to go out and be a little

112
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,250
lazy with their attribution claims

113
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,650
they don't back them up because it's

114
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,650
sexy right they want they want the

115
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,750
reputation and the last one here about

116
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,169
it no be it not being a secret anymore

117
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,570
the bad guys you know back in the day we

118
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,890
never talked about this stuff you know

119
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,920
reports were produced things were

120
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,260
classified up until about 2006 2007

121
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,530
cyber espionage in general just wasn't

122
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,210
discussed in the in the open nowadays

123
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,219
it's it's commonplace to have these

124
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,500
Intel reports just published one after

125
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,030
the other and unfortunately it's great

126
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,280
information but at the same time the

127
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,229
actors are actually consuming this as

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,539
well and they're taking this information

129
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,460
and turning around and using it kind of

130
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,460
against us and to throw us for some

131
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,780
loops and you'll see that in a minute so

132
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,340
let me get a sense of the crowd a little

133
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,580
bit of a kind of trying to study who's

134
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,169
actually here over the past day but how

135
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,909
comfortable do you feel with how

136
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,650
attribution is generally done like

137
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,990
what's what it's based on how many of

138
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,729
you are maybe malware analysts or

139
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,110
reverse engineers how many of you would

140
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,060
classify yourself that way I see a

141
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,280
couple of hands going up how many of you

142
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,780
actually read some of the reports some

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,059
of the apt reports and so on

144
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,280
see a few more hands alright so I won't

145
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,470
dig too deep into any of these but just

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,830
so you have an idea anytime that you're

147
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,810
seeing a decently substantiated

148
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,060
attribution claim which is to say not

149
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,490
just some random startup or a cyber

150
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:48,530
truth or on Twitter deciding that it's

151
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:51,260
you know random person X this is what if

152
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,270
being based on to some extent you've got

153
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,700
compilation timestamps if it's Windows

154
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,030
malware you can actually see when it was

155
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,620
compiled which means that if you have a

156
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,359
decent set of samples you can actually

157
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,830
create an activity timeline and say you

158
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,140
know if these guys are working 9:00 to

159
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,349
5:00 then they're likely working 9:00 to

160
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,419
5:00 in this general geographic region

161
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,890
you've got strings which will usually

162
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,719
give you a sense of what language these

163
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,210
people might be speaking or debug path

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,790
which will ideally give you a user

165
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,440
folder or some sense of if they're very

166
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,850
organized which some developers are

167
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,469
they'll actually give you some internal

168
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,419
names for their projects and how they

169
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,090
actually go about some of these things a

170
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,370
lot of sloppy actors will leave resource

171
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,650
languages in there so you know a lot of

172
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,910
the Lazarus group malware has

173
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,258
Riaan language resources in the malware

174
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,120
if you're an appoint of good visibility

175
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,500
you will get a sense of tasking or

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,900
targeting you know who are these people

177
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,539
going after who they care to target or

178
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,388
who have they successfully victimized

179
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:51,770
with this malware and you can also look

180
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,660
at obviously command and control

181
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,849
infrastructure and how it's being reused

182
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,380
if you're in a lucky privileged position

183
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,970
you might see some back-end connections

184
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,789
how do they connect to these servers

185
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,919
from where and then things that were

186
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,169
particularly fond of malware families

187
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,289
how the code is being reused in order to

188
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,849
develop that toolkit over time or into

189
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:13,340
different malware families or in two

190
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,199
entirely different operations and every

191
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,198
so often you get some power a password

192
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,660
or encryption key reuse that might allow

193
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,070
you to tie some things together now for

194
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,650
those of you that are more familiar with

195
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,479
threat Intel and more skeptical you

196
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,479
should be very well aware that all of

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,349
these things can be manipulated or faked

198
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,300
or changed or altered that's not to say

199
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:37,820
that they always are that is a mistake

200
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,690
that is commonly made by some of the

201
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,280
armchair analysts which is yeah that

202
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,590
means that every single time stamp is

203
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,750
fake every single c2 is somebody else to

204
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,250
see to every single piece of code is

205
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,500
somebody else's code that's not the case

206
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,960
but they can be manipulated so we're

207
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,389
trying to keep some of this in mind and

208
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,280
we'd like to rather than continue to

209
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,870
discuss things in theory we want to

210
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,580
start to put some examples into common

211
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,949
parlance we want to put some examples

212
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,449
out there for people to actually be able

213
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,900
to hang their hat on this and say this

214
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,570
is an example of perhaps not entirely a

215
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,120
false flag operation not a successful

216
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,330
event of somebody being entirely fooled

217
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,430
that it was somebody else but clear

218
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,840
cases of manipulation by advanced threat

219
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,250
actors of some of the things that we've

220
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,419
been discussing or all the things that

221
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,270
we've been discussing now in order to do

222
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,650
that I need you to give me something I

223
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,529
need your help

224
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,439
we are an attribution agnostic company

225
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,120
and I fully believe that as part of our

226
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,709
research team I think that we do this on

227
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,839
purpose we do it for a good reason and

228
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:43,130
for any of you who watch this talk or

229
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,480
read the paper hopefully it'll become

230
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,040
evident why we do that

231
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,480
that said in order for me to tell you

232
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,490
that something was a false flag you also

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,000
have to allow me to say hey this is

234
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,430
believed to be a Ukrainian operation or

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,140
Colombian operation and they pulled the

236
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,640
you know they pull something over our

237
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,319
eyes and they tried to make us believe

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,939
they were from somewhere else so in

239
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,730
order to do that I'm asking you to allow

240
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,460
us to make some of these claims as of

241
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,750
their room and they're rumors they're

242
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,940
part of what you hear through the

243
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,980
Attribution grapevine and not to

244
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,240
atribute them to us directly will tell

245
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,130
you when we feel that we've got

246
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,690
something going there but we're not

247
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,800
saying that these operations come from

248
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,850
there for reasons that I think will

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,410
become exceedingly obvious okay so let's

250
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,000
get into the good stuff

251
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,920
the first apt group that we're going to

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,720
talk about is Cloud Atlas a lot of

253
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,000
people know him as Inception Blue Coat

254
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,320
wrote a fantastic paper on it and then a

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,900
few others have actually written some

256
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,330
good stuff too but just to go into a

257
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,640
couple details about them at first we

258
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,770
personally and at Kaspersky and some

259
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,750
others also believe that this is a

260
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,910
spin-off from Red October Red October

261
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,560
was traditionally considered a Russian

262
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,199
group or may be a joint effort between

263
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,459
Russia and Ukraine potentially and then

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,130
after some things started happening

265
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,080
Cloud Atlas kind of showed up these guys

266
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,610
are usually considered to be Eastern

267
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,770
European base some people will actually

268
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,770
say that this is the Ukraine half of Red

269
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,960
October potentially I'm not going to say

270
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,829
either way but again attribution

271
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,450
grapevine

272
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,030
what's cool about them is they rely on

273
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,930
cloud-based services for further situ in

274
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:21,600
their exfil and they really really enjoy

275
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,680
messing with investigators and a lot of

276
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
their malware that they've created

277
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,949
they've purposely thrown in some of

278
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,660
these false Flags that one was just

279
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,000
talking about those little tidbits that

280
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,160
can be manipulated and they are still

281
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,840
active today but not as much I've kind

282
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,209
of lost track of them a little bit we

283
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,640
found some things here and there

284
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,610
but what's really cool is I kind of

285
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,680
called them the turducken an apt it'syou

286
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,570
know it's like a onion as you peel back

287
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,569
the layers that's kind of funny

288
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,850
so just to go through a couple things

289
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,459
why why we call him that so at first

290
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,139
when the attacks were discovered the

291
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,910
documents and the wars that were used in

292
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,430
the attacks actually they had Spanish

293
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,579
metadata some of the content was in

294
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,529
Spanish language and and in general

295
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,170
things were pointing towards you know

296
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:12,709
potentially a Spanish apt looking at

297
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,829
maybe domestic targets within Spain then

298
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:16,729
as we found the mobile malware

299
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,888
specifically the blackberry and the

300
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,420
Android versions there was Arabic and

301
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:22,970
Hindi strings actually embedded inside

302
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,500
of that so we're like okay hmm middle

303
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,720
eastern actor potentially that's

304
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,529
targeting Spain maybe that doesn't

305
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,699
really fit the mold then we found this

306
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,980
and actually this was pointed out I

307
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,630
think by blue code originally but what's

308
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,279
interesting about this phrase which was

309
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,620
embedded in another piece of malware is

310
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,300
that the word does actually capitalized

311
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,800
not many people capitalize the word

312
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,189
though when you're referring to the

313
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,540
Queen except for maybe people that were

314
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,540
up here on stage right before us

315
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,440
some of their c2s so other than the

316
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,600
cloud-based exfil stuff that they were

317
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,890
doing a lot of the rest of their si twos

318
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,020
and a lot of their infrastructure they

319
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,850
were using was actually comprised of

320
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,000
home routers within South Korea that

321
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,910
were popped so again you know okay we've

322
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,020
got Korean sea twos we've got some kind

323
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,939
of UK phrase Hindi Arabic Spanish this

324
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,280
is the really cool part so they were

325
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,780
monitoring their exfil and their victims

326
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,030
and what they were doing was as the

327
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,220
exfil was happening they were deploying

328
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,110
their stage two based on the victim well

329
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,610
a lot of researchers caught when to this

330
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,680
and they started playing with the

331
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,330
malware and they started going into you

332
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,760
know the cloud-based services well what

333
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,470
this got these guys did instead was when

334
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,210
they saw a potential researcher come in

335
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,980
instead of deploying the real stage 2

336
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,200
they actually threw a piece of Chinese

337
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,820
malware out there instead so it was kind

338
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,610
of like a big fu to everybody and

339
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,370
obviously it looked like they were

340
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,450
purposely setting their system clocks

341
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,580
different every time they would compile

342
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,120
malware so that whole trend analysis of

343
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:59,220
work hours based on compiled times

344
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,960
actually went out the window on that so

345
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:06,060
yeah so that's fairly let's say that's

346
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,620
fairly simple in some ways especially

347
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,880
the things about strings you can

348
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,860
obviously put whatever strings you want

349
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,300
on a binary and switch languages and so

350
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,040
on and so forth and that's something

351
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,060
that also happened with wild Neutron I

352
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,370
don't know if any of you are familiar

353
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,920
while Neutron or more for butterfly

354
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:24,210
depending on who you follow who your

355
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,800
favorite vendor is they had in some

356
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,940
other malware they they had Romanian

357
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,370
strings for goodbye they have some

358
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,050
transliteration of Russian and that's

359
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,970
not really what's interesting about them

360
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,250
because let's get away from the strings

361
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,110
thing strings are cool but obviously

362
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,160
anybody can manipulate that instead

363
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,810
let's talk about something that

364
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,579
essentially breaks down the paradigm of

365
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,760
how we understand some of these threat

366
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,470
actors a lot of our understanding of

367
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,510
different threat actors and and how they

368
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,580
correlate the geopolitical tensions and

369
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:53,069
situations has to do with tasking and

370
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,170
targeting at the end of the day a cyber

371
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,200
operation is going to map on to some

372
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,810
tension some conflict in the real world

373
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,640
that you can't hide that you can't

374
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,390
necessarily alter and that everybody

375
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,800
most

376
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,600
like Lee knows about everybody knows

377
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,099
that there is a tension between Israel

378
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,340
and Iran and like different countries

379
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,660
that are having some sort of well some

380
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,430
bit got some skin in the game and

381
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,600
chances are cyber operations are gonna

382
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,989
become involved as well

383
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,490
so it's it feels fairly easy for certain

384
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,260
analysts especially the ones that come

385
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,620
from the real you know from the IC and

386
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,140
the Intel space to say well if we can

387
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,390
map a similar relationship between

388
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,370
attackers and victims and clearly we

389
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,750
must be seeing some organization that

390
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,840
belongs to one of these countries

391
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:39,840
carrying out that confident cyberspace

392
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,970
however there is a different kind of

393
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,830
threat actor that hasn't been discussed

394
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,180
very much that breaks an entire paradigm

395
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:49,950
down and that is the mercenary actor

396
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,060
once you look at someone like wild

397
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,370
Neutron which is actually one of my

398
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,290
favorites especially when it comes to

399
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,940
the notion of false flags these guys

400
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,430
were very intimately aware of

401
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,840
researchers they were very aware of how

402
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,880
some of these things were investigated

403
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,290
they were quite elite in their own way

404
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,320
and have some zero-days and some

405
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:11,520
interesting toolkits but beyond all of

406
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,290
that they led people on a merry chase of

407
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,500
you know who might actually be behind

408
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,390
this this operation and once you tried

409
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,770
to rely on the old method of looking at

410
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,330
some of the victimology and some of the

411
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,340
targets in order to understand who they

412
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:27,300
might be the whole thing falls apart

413
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,710
because there is a nexus of financial

414
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,209
interest I mean they were going after

415
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,800
mergers and acquisitions companies they

416
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,960
were going after a lot of IT firms

417
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,459
companies that were about to IPO so

418
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,080
obviously you can say ok well you know

419
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,490
there's some financial interests but

420
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,020
then they were also going after law

421
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,150
firms they were interested in investment

422
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,730
companies they were interested in larger

423
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:48,390
companies like Apple and Microsoft

424
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:49,830
Twitter which you know is kind of

425
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,600
interesting but doesn't quite fit the

426
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,160
mold then they were going after

427
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,540
healthcare companies and individual

428
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,130
users and then all of a sudden we find

429
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,079
that you know they were also involved in

430
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,780
operations in counterterrorism

431
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,840
operations which essentially breaks the

432
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,360
mold of just the financially motivated

433
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:13,170
attacker or just the criminal attacker

434
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,270
or just a politically motivated attacker

435
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,259
because they didn't hit any government

436
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,429
institutions or diplomat

437
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,829
institutions but they went after

438
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:23,009
counterterrorism targets so if you think

439
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:27,179
about well Neutron as a mercenary threat

440
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:28,619
actor it essentially takes the wind out

441
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,600
of your sails when considering the

442
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:32,429
possibility of just looking at tasking

443
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,769
and being able to figure out what

444
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:37,079
they're actually interested in now let's

445
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,819
move on to something different so rather

446
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,410
than just saying okay we can't quite

447
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:42,118
tell where you're coming from what

448
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,559
happens when actors start to

449
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:46,139
purposefully try to point you in the

450
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,850
wrong direction so the first example a

451
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,799
larger trend of that we want to talk

452
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,999
about and it's gonna become it's become

453
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,829
that much more important since we wrote

454
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:55,589
the paper about nine months ago is the

455
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:58,919
idea of apt actors trying to point that

456
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:59,910
lesser actors like hacktivists I think

457
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,189
you can see where I'm starting to go

458
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,189
with this when we started to write this

459
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:06,329
it was it was not well accepted in the

460
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,279
research community it was an

461
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,959
uncomfortable idea so we're gonna give

462
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,789
you a weak version of that and then the

463
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,470
strong version of that the weak version

464
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,059
of that is the Lazarus group a lot of

465
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,079
you probably know them from the infinite

466
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:22,230
and the infamous Sony hack despite many

467
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:25,378
ridiculous cyber truther claims it's a

468
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,750
fairly well established group they've

469
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:29,100
been acting since about 2008 with

470
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,360
different malware families but a lot of

471
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,059
things that you can technically trace

472
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,769
back to a giant cluster of activity they

473
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,399
didn't just pop out of nowhere however

474
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:40,379
what led some of that confusion was that

475
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:42,209
they have a sentence II to stand up fake

476
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:44,428
hacktivism groups for all of their

477
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,019
different operations now I say that this

478
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,840
is the weak version of doing this

479
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,909
because there's no pedigree they stand

480
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,220
up activist fronts that have never been

481
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:55,019
active in forums don't have a following

482
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,879
have never actually hacked a website

483
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,799
before have never leaked anything before

484
00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:01,860
and all of a sudden they conduct a

485
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,129
really large-scale notorious operation

486
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,799
with some ridiculous flimsy ransom note

487
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:09,870
from like the new Romanian cyber army

488
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,240
the new romantic cyber army the who am i

489
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,428
crew the guardians to peace which

490
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,080
confuses reporters for about you know

491
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:19,200
six hours and then everybody goes back

492
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,439
to the more obvious theory about where

493
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,230
these guys might be from the strong

494
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,250
version of that the fanciest version of

495
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,810
that

496
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:32,760
is my baby yeah so we'll talk about the

497
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,550
800-pound elephant or bear in the room

498
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,230
right now so yeah sofa see hopefully

499
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,950
everybody understands who this actor is

500
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,900
the last eight months or so have been a

501
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,050
pretty crazy wild ride especially

502
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,940
working for who we work for but yeah

503
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,800
just to go through the actor real quick

504
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,620
traditionally most people consider these

505
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,830
guys to be Russian based they've got a

506
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,739
huge amount of resources they drop o

507
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:02,250
days like a like a PEZ dispenser I've

508
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,620
never seen that an apt group just

509
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,180
carelessly tossed o days out left and

510
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,860
right I think we found three in one

511
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,660
month at one point

512
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,570
what's cool about them is their

513
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,530
targeting has expanded and it includes

514
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,280
you know domestic and foreign media

515
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,920
counterterrorism which is not

516
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,050
traditionally falls under an espionage

517
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,180
group for example as well as you know

518
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,240
the typical foreign intelligence

519
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,740
organizations and dissidents as well

520
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,720
huge infrastructure lots of resources

521
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,170
like I said the best part about these

522
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,030
guys is they love to Jack with people so

523
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,830
we've changed these slides up a little

524
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,420
bit because previously we actually went

525
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,250
through three of the different personas

526
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,250
and kind of went through in great detail

527
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,900
the way we did in the paper

528
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,990
unfortunately because of the summer and

529
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,370
all the crap that happened there's just

530
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,250
a huge amount of information we can't

531
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,080
possibly cover it all so I have three

532
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,850
slides the first one we just want to

533
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:01,189
kind of show what happened with this

534
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:05,490
group up until early 2015

535
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:08,670
that should say pre 2015 sofa C was your

536
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,620
traditional cyber espionage factor they

537
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,770
were pretty quiet they were careful with

538
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,479
their OPSEC if they thought that they

539
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,510
were being caught they would back out of

540
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,300
a system or move on to the next victim

541
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:23,310
around 2015 we started seeing some kind

542
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,659
of mess ups on their part and it made a

543
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,190
lot of us scratch our heads like why

544
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,720
would these guys that used to be pretty

545
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,090
good why are they doing this

546
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,440
they got really brazen they would

547
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,000
understand that people were watching

548
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,679
them they knew they were caught but yet

549
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,360
they would still smash and grab and

550
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,790
leave walk right out the front door they

551
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,340
just didn't care they're upset got

552
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,070
really

553
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,020
lazy so they also expanded their

554
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,450
targeting used to be government

555
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,850
traditional espionage type organizations

556
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,470
then they expanded out to the foreign

557
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,850
and domestic media they started

558
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,900
targeting dissidents they went into

559
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,840
counterterrorism

560
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:59,020
more recently they've actually hit - yes

561
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,209
- election cycles or democratic

562
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,410
elections most people understand the one

563
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,200
there was actually another one before

564
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,710
that so and their deception operations

565
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:13,180
began right around this time and early

566
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,770
2015 - June ish there was some issues

567
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,410
going on everybody's familiar with the

568
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,840
Ukraine conflict also the Russian

569
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,730
economy in particular just completely

570
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,220
tanked around June of 2015

571
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:28,140
whether or not these changes in TTP's

572
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,640
were because of that or possibly

573
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,980
operational tempo don't know but there

574
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,080
was a definite major shift right around

575
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,700
that time frame so targets what I wanted

576
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,010
to do here was a lot of people

577
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,230
understand or have heard probably most

578
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,320
of these but to see them all on one page

579
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,960
on who they've hit in the last couple

580
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,899
years it's pretty mind-blowing these

581
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,850
guys have been crazy active they've been

582
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,550
hammering anybody that they want and

583
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:00,129
basically nothing's being done so at

584
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,600
first they started with Ukraine they hit

585
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,090
the government they hit the Election

586
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,699
Committee they went after critical

587
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,620
infrastructure they hit billboards they

588
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,090
blocked cell phone calls from government

589
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,520
representatives they just basically

590
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,649
caused mass chaos within Ukraine during

591
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,870
the conflict then they turn their

592
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,790
attention to Germany they've hit

593
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,310
Bundestag and Parliament at least twice

594
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:24,629
and what's interesting is those occurred

595
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:27,700
in the last year or so maybe two years

596
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:31,720
the Germans I believe have an election

597
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,670
coming up this year in 2017 so keeping

598
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,310
the maybe in a few months we'll see

599
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,970
something different what was really cool

600
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,200
at one point was the Polish President

601
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,180
publicly said during the conflict in

602
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,060
Ukraine we're moving all of our troops

603
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,220
up to the border with Poland and Russia

604
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,690
because we're terrified about what's

605
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,580
going to happen these guys are acting

606
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,830
crazy we don't know so we're posturing

607
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,240
ourselves to try to avoid calm

608
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,230
like three days later sofas II turned

609
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,299
around and hacked the Warsaw Stock

610
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,279
Exchange and published it as cyber

611
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:04,899
caliphate and basically it was a big

612
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,299
middle finger to pull in for moving

613
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:09,059
their troops to the border then they

614
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,710
turn their attention to media outlets

615
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,529
the most important one people understand

616
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,640
I think is the tv5 monde incident where

617
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:17,740
they were actually able to go in and

618
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,929
shut down I think of us like 10 or 12

619
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,179
stations nationally or channels

620
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:24,880
nationally and actually broadcasts Isis

621
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:27,039
propaganda they they hit a few media

622
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,620
outlets in Maryland I think in Arizona

623
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,330
as well then they turned their attention

624
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,279
to CENTCOM they hit their Twitter

625
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,449
account they broadcast Isis propaganda

626
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:39,220
up on centcom's Twitter account awesome

627
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,799
Saudi ministry at foreign affairs what

628
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,740
we do know is that sofas he actually did

629
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:49,990
compromise Saudi MOFA I believe it was

630
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:51,070
February of 2015 then in June of 2015 or

631
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,289
May

632
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,299
Yemen's cyber army which we described in

633
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:57,220
the paper actually published a bunch of

634
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,980
leaked cables from Saudi ministry I

635
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,049
don't know if the two are related but I

636
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,029
will just say that sofa C definitely

637
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:06,279
compromised them three months before

638
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:09,190
this massive leak occurred through

639
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:11,919
WikiLeaks and the Saudi leaks the

640
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,750
Olympics came around Russia got hit with

641
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,970
the doping scandal

642
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,340
all of a sudden wada which is the

643
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,279
anti-doping administration and task cast

644
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,720
which is the Court of Arbitration sport

645
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,240
ended up getting targeted they were

646
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,649
targeting actually athletes to gather

647
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,389
credentials and then use those

648
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:30,699
credentials to log in and get

649
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:33,549
information to turn around and kind of

650
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,460
slander other athletes then obviously in

651
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:37,929
the summertime we had DNC DCCC Podesta

652
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,010
emails we had the Bradley Foundation

653
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:43,360
which was targeted they actually

654
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,620
modified some information to post out

655
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,570
there to make it look like Bradley

656
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,639
Foundation was contributing to the the

657
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,279
Clinton campaign in massive amounts

658
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:56,590
month so if you look at that screen

659
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:58,120
they've been busy busy little bears so

660
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,928
some of the personas real quick to go

661
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,178
through cyber Burcu this was the Ukraine

662
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:06,130
conflict as well as I think maybe

663
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:09,560
Bundestag

664
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,900
but basically this was the supposed

665
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,810
cyber arm of the secret police that was

666
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:18,080
disbanded after Yanukovych was outed out

667
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:21,379
of Ukraine they created cyber caliphate

668
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,590
this was the cyber Isis version that

669
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,350
they were using a targeted US media

670
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,850
CENTCOM all that stuff then we have YCA

671
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,709
that can be debated

672
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,530
I personally leaned towards this being

673
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,150
them some people claim it's Iranian it

674
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:40,160
could actually potentially be a combined

675
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:42,970
effort don't know goosed 42.0 DC leaks

676
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,850
was created fancy bears hacked team and

677
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,470
at anonymous polling all of these are

678
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,959
personas that they've created in the

679
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,760
last couple years it's amazing the

680
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,280
amount of resources that have to go into

681
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,080
creating this stuff and maintain it and

682
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,340
the infrastructure that's used it's

683
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,500
incredible

684
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,060
these guys are right now the best ones

685
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,060
out there for this type of information

686
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:08,000
quick note on that last one so we were

687
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,590
aware of the Wada task casting just

688
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,330
based on like domain registrations we're

689
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,060
already starting the report and then if

690
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:17,120
you can see that tiny tiny tweet at the

691
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,790
bottom one of the base they used a bunch

692
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,229
of bots to try to spread the news of

693
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,710
their leak of the Bradley Foundation

694
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,620
stuff and then the tab the task a stuff

695
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:30,050
they started tweeting at me at a bunch

696
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,330
of other researchers at Curt who works

697
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,250
with us Alex ghost of a bunch of like

698
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,199
media outlets and everything so I'm

699
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,060
honestly I'm sorry one more thing I'm

700
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,630
gonna so fuzzy list yeah this really

701
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:44,200
gets my juices flowing um we just saw

702
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,580
them two months prior or two months ago

703
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,310
taking more documents from wada

704
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,020
turning around and sending emails to

705
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,450
journalists actually in Russia and other

706
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,010
places and saying hey we've got this new

707
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,500
leak from wada we have new information

708
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,210
that we stole would you like to see it

709
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,440
and journalists are saying yeah and the

710
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,510
information they're sending to the

711
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,710
journalists is actually trojan eyes so

712
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:06,080
now they're taking that information

713
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,240
turning it around and targeting domestic

714
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,679
media with leaked information that

715
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,150
they've stolen from somebody else

716
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,100
it's pretty amazing alright so you got

717
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,050
the big bad bear I'll go through some of

718
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,270
these very quickly rather than talking

719
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,280
about an apt trying to throw

720
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,379
blame at a lower level actor like a

721
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,940
hacktivist what happens when now that

722
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,530
you know research is popular and all of

723
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,360
us are so familiar with different TTP's

724
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:29,480
for different threat actors what happens

725
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,219
when an apt acted decides to just cast

726
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,380
the blame on a different apt threat

727
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,400
actor so a really weak version of that

728
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,470
is the illest Dooku to whom we had such

729
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,970
admiration for Dooku and put out so many

730
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,250
blog posts and research the original

731
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,960
Dooku so much that they were kind enough

732
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,080
to hand deliver the second version

733
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,600
directly to our offices so we had a

734
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,399
great time researching this memory

735
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,840
resident tons you know Oh days and like

736
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,090
all this really cool Network level

737
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,340
understanding of a victim and so on but

738
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,560
if you look at the only thing that rests

739
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,500
on disk which is the kernel driver the

740
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,669
32-bit version in the 64-bit version

741
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,950
have different strings in them one of

742
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,210
them is Romanian anti hacker which I'll

743
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,190
let you guess who that might have been

744
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,920
in reference to the other one was ugly

745
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,470
gorilla which is Wang dongs handle from

746
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,380
the apt one report it is actually

747
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,180
patently ridiculous to consider that a

748
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,580
bTW one and dukey tour anyway related

749
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,550
mostly for code based reasons but also

750
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,740
for every other reason so this is like a

751
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,020
really weak version of that what's a

752
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,120
cooler version of that Tiger milk this

753
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,190
is one of my babies that has never seen

754
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,540
the light of day sadly but I will kind

755
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,690
of like lift the veil a little bit so we

756
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,730
can discuss it it's a campaign that

757
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,490
focused on targeting a single South

758
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,680
American country for six months mostly

759
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:49,430
military and government institutions the

760
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:52,790
malware sucked it was mostly it was

761
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,230
mostly meant to inject into the desktop

762
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,940
and just try to steal some credentials

763
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,770
it was really just kind of like a first

764
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,630
stage we never actually got to see the

765
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,389
next deployment so why is this

766
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:04,790
interesting at all well for any of the

767
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,350
nerds out there the true geeks does

768
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,480
anybody recognize this digital

769
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,879
certificate if you can you know look

770
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,650
look real close there anybody familiar

771
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,280
with Mike what this might be can shout

772
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:20,450
it out it is the exact same Stuxnet

773
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,520
certificate the one that was stolen from

774
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:25,580
real Tech presumably and used for

775
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,540
Stuxnet versions a and B it was stolen

776
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,030
for Stuxnet it was never made public

777
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,010
more importantly

778
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,990
it was revoked and would have expired

779
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:38,740
anyways years before this operation

780
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:42,580
Tiger milk op in 2015 so there is

781
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:44,260
literally zero technical gain from using

782
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,169
that digital certificate for them our

783
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,180
however if what you're trying to do is

784
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,430
misguide Peruvian incident responders

785
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,800
into googling some strings and thinking

786
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,380
that you know it was the big bad stucks

787
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,450
and that it was a friendly government it

788
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,770
might be worth your investment so the

789
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,370
real question here is how the hell did

790
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:05,440
they get it I have no idea so we can

791
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,850
skip through this one just real quick

792
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,410
you know Turla skipped through those

793
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,379
slides I think most people understand

794
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:14,470
Turla faking dragon was basically an

795
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,870
incident where we recognized Turla on a

796
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,690
victim machine and once Turla caught

797
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:22,449
wind that they were being looked at they

798
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,500
essentially deployed a fake TLS version

799
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:28,600
of a rare at the time a PT malware

800
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,790
called Corian so anyway long story short

801
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,040
they basically sent the researchers down

802
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,170
this huge rabbit hole to come up with

803
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,940
you know the conclusion that oh this was

804
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,590
Chinese base meanwhile they went in and

805
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,420
deleted all their crap and backed out of

806
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,280
the logs and moved on to other victims

807
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,050
so just another way of kind of

808
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,700
redirecting researchers and they're

809
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,800
actually still using this technique I

810
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,860
just found something this week they're

811
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,220
doing the exact same thing today so

812
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:56,649
moving on to the more important part so

813
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,360
why are we doing this talk if you get

814
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,820
anything from the rest of this stuff yes

815
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,679
we have three minutes okay if you get

816
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,810
anything from this take these things

817
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,810
away the first part is what level of

818
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:09,730
attribution do you need as a consumer we

819
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,620
kind of split this up into into three

820
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,270
different levels you have the government

821
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,979
you've got private sector and yes you

822
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,670
have media so if you're the government

823
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,320
you obviously need the most fidelity in

824
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,280
your attribution why because you're

825
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,409
going to turn around you're going to

826
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,270
conduct cyber operations back at say the

827
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,580
country of origin that conducted them at

828
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,710
you or you're gonna leverage sanctions

829
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,879
to Marsha's things like that indictments

830
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:35,830
if you get into private sector though

831
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,900
individual attribution the person that

832
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,480
did the attack a picture of the guy with

833
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,460
his kid riding his bicycle it's not

834
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,260
needed it's it's

835
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,680
say yes but what the hell you don't need

836
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,690
that more importantly you need country

837
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,190
level attribution you know where are

838
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,830
your resources where are you doing

839
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,480
business if you're not doing business in

840
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,850
China do you really need to worry about

841
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,340
Chinese threat actors don't know maybe

842
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:02,730
you do but something to think about the

843
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,520
last part which I kind of irritates me a

844
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,140
little bit is the media when you talk to

845
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,820
the media the first thing they ask you

846
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,520
is basically who was it I want to know

847
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,620
who it is give me a picture they ask

848
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,230
that but at the same time they don't ask

849
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,520
the why you know and as a journalist if

850
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,170
you're sitting in the audience please

851
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,629
next time that you're talking to someone

852
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,950
and you ask them who did it make sure

853
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,660
you follow up with give me some

854
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,640
information as to why you're saying this

855
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,350
it helps us all in the long run we're

856
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,760
gonna rush just through a few

857
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,250
conclusions just so you guys can have

858
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,790
some takeaways here some of those things

859
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:37,710
have been discussed over the past day

860
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:40,050
basically keep in mind threat

861
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,400
intelligence is not IT or IR I know that

862
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,750
some of this was discussed yesterday in

863
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,220
the chalet with the hot cocoa and

864
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,140
everybody was friendly and everybody was

865
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,400
cool but there is something that the red

866
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,100
intelligence is doing that these other

867
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,410
disciplines aren't necessarily doing and

868
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,240
honestly it's it's about perspective and

869
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,460
experience but more importantly it's

870
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,720
about historical context the reason that

871
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,220
you can tell that these things don't

872
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,320
really fit the mold is because you have

873
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,700
a historical awareness of the TTP's and

874
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,560
how these thread actors are functioning

875
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,150
what they do what these toolkits are

876
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,919
where they've been and where they should

877
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,300
and shouldn't be and that's something

878
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,890
that threat Intel is going to do for you

879
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,470
that other disciplines cannot do for you

880
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:15,660
also there are uniquely positioned

881
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,910
entities to do attribution we are not

882
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,850
those entities chances are you are not

883
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,230
those entities keep that in mind when

884
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,510
somebody comes and tries to sell you an

885
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,860
attribution claim also when they try to

886
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,450
tell your attribution is impossible

887
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,959
that's not necessarily the case the

888
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,510
Sigyn Giants the gods and the wires have

889
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,130
a much greater ability to do this at the

890
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,070
same time they are the cassandra's of

891
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,870
the modern age if they tell you what

892
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,100
they know nobody will believe them

893
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,459
because they can't substantiate it

894
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:47,820
publicly so keep that in mind yeah

895
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,040
finally a couple takeaways as consumers

896
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,350
for example just ask yourself a couple

897
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,250
of these questions so the first one is

898
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,840
you know hacking

899
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,880
back active defense things like that

900
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,070
what happens with that technique or that

901
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,710
thought if you really as we just showed

902
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,179
can't necessarily pinpoint your target

903
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,470
keep that in mind are you willing to

904
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,910
stick your neck out there and actually

905
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,129
do some of this stuff that some people

906
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,020
are doing again what extent do you need

907
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,540
that attribution try to remember do I

908
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,250
need country level specific things where

909
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,840
to direct my resources or do I actually

910
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,239
need individual stuff where do I need

911
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,770
attribution at all right do I just need

912
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,540
the cluster groups do I just need to

913
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,909
know that this was so fuzzy I really

914
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,540
don't care if it's GRU or if it's FSB or

915
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:29,010
whoever just that it's this group it's

916
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,529
this thread actor that people this

917
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,540
nebulous thing that people have defined

918
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,460
the last part obviously if you're

919
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,139
producing intelligence please please

920
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,149
PLEASE ask yourself what actionable

921
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,310
intelligence are you giving the consumer

922
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:42,629
if you're just going out there and

923
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,449
putting these reports on the internet

924
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:47,668
and inputting fancy pictures and awesome

925
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:50,219
claims and or just arguing for sake of

926
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:52,109
arguing and not providing any real facts

927
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,449
or any IOC s or anything that the

928
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,510
consumer can use to turn around and

929
00:34:54,449 --> 00:35:01,189
defend their stuff then you shouldn't be

930
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,190
producing it in the first place in shame

931
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,310
[Music]

932
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,310
you
