1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,869
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,179
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,116
- My name is Amy Bejtlich,

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,852
and I'm here to talk to you
about analytic tradecraft

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,253
and threat intelligence.

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,523
Little bit about my background.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,759
I'm a career intel analyst.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,930
I started in traditional intel
with United States Air Force.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,499
I was a 14-N Bravo.

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,134
I did collections.

11
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,871
My training was primarily
signals intelligence, SIGINT.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,007
And then I went and worked
at Air Intelligence Agency.

13
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,876
My first job was in the
Information Operation Center.

14
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:49,149
And then after working on
the watch floor for a while,

15
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,551
I moved over to Measures
and Signature Intelligence

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,287
Program Office, MASINT.

17
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:58,691
So that was my airforce
experience, pretty broad

18
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,860
as far as intel is concerned.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,829
Then I moved over to the FBI,

20
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,832
and I was a Counterterrorism
Analyst there.

21
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,469
And then most recently, I moved
over into Cyber threat Intel

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,172
first for a financial
institution,

23
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,342
and then for a Fortune 20
telecommunications company.

24
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,478
And as Katie said
most recently I joined

25
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,913
the Dragos Threat Intel team,

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,384
where we focus on the security
of industrial networks.

27
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,189
So why do we care about
analytic tradecraft?

28
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,958
Tradecraft is the holistic
view of the analytic process.

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,529
It's methods we use to answer
intelligence questions,

30
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,399
and tradecraft
standards are important,

31
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,468
because it provides
a common language,

32
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,870
and a common approach
to improve the quality

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,039
and utility of
intelligence analysis.

34
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,609
It also provides a baseline
for training and education

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,612
and it mitigates the
likelihood of Intel failures

36
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,048
due to insufficient analysis
or lapses in integrity.

37
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,520
But the bottom line
about that though is

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,889
my personal belief, what
we do is too important

39
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,592
for us not to have standards.

40
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,961
So today I'm going
to go over these

41
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,696
ten tradecraft standards.

42
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:14,067
They come from The
Compendium of Analytic

43
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,535
Tradecraft Notes.

44
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,770
That was a document that
the CIA Directorate of Intel

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,507
created in the 1990s.

46
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,376
And it included one note
for each of the 10 standards

47
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,512
deemed essential to
analytic tradecraft.

48
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,280
There are a lot of
different resources

49
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,617
that we can use to draw from
for analytic tradecraft,

50
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,553
but this is a really
great starting point.

51
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,054
In this presentation
I'll introduce you

52
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,990
to 10 analytic
tradecraft skills,

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,193
and how they may be applied
to threat intelligence.

54
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,231
First skill, address
consumers' interests.

55
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,834
It seems pretty
straightforward to identify

56
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,369
who you're reporting for,

57
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,872
but I can tell you working
in the corporate environment

58
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,376
and working for military and
headquarters organizations,

59
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,846
yeah sure your primary
audience or primary consumers

60
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,080
might be obvious.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,650
You have a lot more
than just that person

62
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,152
or organization that
you're writing for,

63
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,522
and in my experience that's
sometimes taken weeks or months

64
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,124
to identify all the different,

65
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,661
all the different
organizations that you,

66
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,829
all the different
organizations that you

67
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,998
might be writing for.

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,970
When I worked in a
telecommunications company,

69
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,606
we knew we were
writing for the CSO,

70
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,608
but we also took weeks
to identifying it

71
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,078
in some cases like I said
months to identify that.

72
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,080
We were also writing
for other business lines

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,482
and then who to identify
within those business lines

74
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,717
and the distribution list?

75
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,818
That takes a while so.

76
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,421
It's not trivial to identify

77
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,423
who your primary consumer is.

78
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,026
Once you know who your
primary consumers are

79
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,561
and your secondary consumers,

80
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,998
it's important to know what
their goals and values are,

81
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,632
both within the organization

82
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,569
and within their specific rules.

83
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,072
Because those values translate
to intelligence requirements

84
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,978
which are fundamental to driving
the intel analysis process.

85
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,614
And then finally, this
is more of a practical

86
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,917
consideration, but understanding
the situational awareness

87
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,686
of your users.

88
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,356
When I was at Air
Intelligence Agency,

89
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,690
we were briefing the commander.

90
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,125
I did the daily
situational awareness brief

91
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,395
and then the weekly
command brief.

92
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,698
So every day when we
produced that briefing,

93
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,734
we pulled from all the
component commands,

94
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,537
and made sure that
everything that they were

95
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,008
reporting on was represented
at the headquarters level.

96
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:39,512
But when I went over to
the corporate environment,

97
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,247
we were writing for the CSO,

98
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,017
we knew that she read
The Wall Street Journal

99
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,719
and The Washington Post and
The New York Times every day.

100
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,622
So if there was reporting,
open source reporting

101
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,859
that had even a slight
cyber flavor to it,

102
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,395
we knew that that was something
we needed to get out ahead

103
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,296
of because she was gonna
ask questions about it,

104
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,932
because she was probably
going to be asked questions

105
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,335
about it even if it didn't
affect our organization.

106
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,936
So it's important to understand
the situational awareness

107
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,572
that your consumers have

108
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,542
so that you can address
that preemptively.

109
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,682
The second tradecraft skill
is access and credibility.

110
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,258
So the questions that the
questions that we ask are,

111
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:29,027
do you have established channels
to reach your key consumers

112
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,631
and do your consumers
rely on your products

113
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,965
to make decisions?

114
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,566
And that's basically
what we see up here,

115
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,102
that comes down to trust.

116
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,638
Do your consumers
trust what you deliver?

117
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,443
Do the consumers of
your products trust

118
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,612
that the intelligence
you provide is relevant

119
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:50,083
to their concerns and
that it's reliable?

120
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,918
So how do you build trust?

121
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,221
First deliver effective
timely and succinct products.

122
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,524
Have a good product is a
really good place to start.

123
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,160
Second is to demonstrate
subject matter expertise

124
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,098
through extensive research
and first-hand knowledge.

125
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:10,203
The field of threat intel just
like the overarching field

126
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,272
of security in
general it demands,

127
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,041
but it also fosters learning,

128
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,144
and there's great
resources available to us.

129
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,613
There's a recommended
reading list,

130
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,082
cybersecurity book
clubs, Twitter accounts,

131
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,550
blogs, conferences, you name it.

132
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,886
There's no shortage of
resources for us to learn

133
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,223
as security professionals.

134
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,058
Third element of trust.

135
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,460
Do you share what you know?

136
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,496
Do you seek the expertise
of others who know

137
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,131
things that you don't?

138
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,832
Your reputation,
your relationships
and your willingness

139
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,902
to help others matters.

140
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,273
It's important that as
cybersecurity professionals

141
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,343
we not silo ourselves
in that bubble,

142
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,513
and we build relationships.

143
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:59,519
Along those lines, when I
was working with the FBI,

144
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,888
I was part of the Joint
Terrorism Task Force.

145
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,090
And that was a team
that was made up

146
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,794
of different individuals from
law enforcement community,

147
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,831
Intel community,
federal government.

148
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,401
And it was dependent on which
field office we were assigned

149
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,403
to, who was represented.

150
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,007
But we worked together side
by side, day in and day out.

151
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,744
So when we got to a
certain maybe obstacle

152
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,279
in an investigation,

153
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,381
rather than having to start
from scratch and identifying

154
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,618
who to talk to and how to
mitigate those obstacles,

155
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,320
we had somebody on
the team right away

156
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,956
who could pick up the phone
and say hey we need some help

157
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,593
and they could get it
resolved a lot quicker.

158
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,828
So how does that translate

159
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,197
to threat intel
and cybersecurity?

160
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,300
You know you don't want
your, the first time that

161
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,569
you're meeting some of
these key individuals

162
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,804
to be during a crisis.

163
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,239
So who do you call when
you have a really bad day?

164
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,043
If there's an incident, who
do you need to work with?

165
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,479
Is that the first time that
you're dealing with them?

166
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,847
I hope not.

167
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,851
So establishing
relationships with people,

168
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,688
legal, public relations,
HR whomever you might need

169
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,157
to talk to have an ongoing
relationship with them,

170
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,493
and don't wait until
the very bad day

171
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,260
that's what I like to say.

172
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:22,268
The second aspect of access and

173
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,070
credibility is credibility,

174
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,607
the importance of relationships

175
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,841
we talked about.

176
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,978
So the three aspects
of credibility.

177
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,914
Facts, conclusions, and sources.

178
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,583
How good products that emphasize
what's new or different

179
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,018
to enable decision making

180
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,789
but also as analysts and
sometimes this is hard to do,

181
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,691
but identify what we don't know.

182
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,693
That's just as important

183
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:52,698
and identify first
hand primary sources.

184
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,803
If at all possible, use direct
evidence whenever available.

185
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,906
A threat intel team, and
when I say direct evidence,

186
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,741
I mean what are you
seeing on your network.

187
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,876
That should be your
primary source.

188
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,547
So developing direct
evidence may not be possible

189
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,448
for all threat intel
teams right away.

190
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,617
It might be a maturing process,

191
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,086
but it should definitely
be the long-term goal.

192
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,355
What you see on your network
is the best source of data

193
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,357
for threat intel reporting.

194
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,861
And I was at a conference
this last week,

195
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,298
and I had somebody
walk up to me and say,

196
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,134
why do you have your
own naming convention

197
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,069
for threat activity groups?

198
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,304
It just muddies the water.

199
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,172
We should have one
standard name across

200
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,440
the whole industry.

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,310
And I have to say I
think of this comic

202
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,111
when I hear that argument.

203
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:44,116
I feel like you know
we're the individuals

204
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,086
in the picture here
trying to identify

205
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,255
are we all looking
at the same elephant?

206
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,523
I don't know.

207
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,024
Maybe we're looking
at different pieces

208
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,259
of the same elephant.

209
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,560
Maybe we're looking at
all different elephants.

210
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,661
We don't know and that's
what I think about.

211
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,631
When you have your own data,

212
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,134
you can better ascertain
what piece of the elephant

213
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,736
you're looking at.

214
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,670
Different organizations
have different telemetry.

215
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,475
They see different pieces
of an activity group.

216
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,277
So different organizations also

217
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,813
value information differently.

218
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,683
For example one analyst
may deem the activity,

219
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,286
time of activity a key factor,

220
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,686
and another analyst
might think that

221
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,857
that's not valuable at all.

222
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,593
So by assuming the data
and the naming conventions

223
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:31,597
of other organizations,
we assume their biases.

224
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,132
In reality immature
threat intel teams

225
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,102
may not have the
telemetry like I said,

226
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,804
and using common names
or vendor conventions

227
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,040
is acceptable for first step,

228
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,175
but it shouldn't be
a long-term practice.

229
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,680
Bottom line, direct
evidence is best.

230
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,784
Third tradecraft skill,
articulating assumptions.

231
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,755
Many issues in
information security

232
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,158
and in intel can't be
addressed with certainty

233
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,327
as we seldom have
complete information.

234
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,729
So articulating
assumptions is a process

235
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,299
to manage uncertainty by
identifying key variables

236
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,002
and uncertain factors
that may affect

237
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,704
a complex situation.

238
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,807
Analysts assumptions
are subject to error.

239
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,376
So assessments must
be well defended.

240
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,744
The more complex an issue,

241
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,348
the more articulation of
assumptions is required.

242
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,084
As a rule the greater
the degree of uncertainty

243
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,386
around an issue, the greater
the analysts reliance

244
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,588
on judgment rather
than evidence,

245
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,158
the greater the likelihood
of estimated error,

246
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,593
the greater prospect
for divergent views

247
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,562
and the greater
the need for sound

248
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,798
and precise critical thinking.

249
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,967
Reasoning must be logical,
that is soundly reasoned,

250
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:46,105
precise, clearly
stated and realistic

251
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,507
attuned to the
potential for error.

252
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,579
In the absence of not
clarifying the premises

253
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,281
and suppositions and
elements of critical thinking

254
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,250
that brought us to a conclusion,

255
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,820
we risk jumping to
the wrong conclusions.

256
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,955
And that brings me
to a cautionary tale

257
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:06,559
from October of 2017.

258
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,694
We had an individual on our team

259
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,298
who received some
open source reporting

260
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,834
about a nation-state
activity group

261
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,603
and they pulled some indicators
associated with that group,

262
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,805
ran it through the stack,

263
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,242
and got some hits and
got really scared.

264
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,444
And said literally
reported to management

265
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,882
that we were under
attack by a nation-state.

266
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,118
Yeah so that was on Halloween,

267
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,622
and we stood up abridge
and fortunately you know

268
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,424
it was only about
an hour and a half

269
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,925
two hours to resolve it.

270
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,429
But during that time you
could hear the frustration

271
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,964
and you could hear people's
kids crying in the background

272
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,100
because their parents
brought 'em back from going

273
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,702
trick-or-treating or
they were waiting to go

274
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,303
trick-or-treating, and
everybody on the call

275
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,906
knew that maybe
this wasn't exactly

276
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,976
what we have identified it as.

277
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:01,180
So just to pound on that point,

278
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,982
be very clear about
your assumptions

279
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,385
and make sure you walk
through before you jump

280
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,920
to a conclusion like that,

281
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,823
because that was a really bad
day for the threat intel team.

282
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,661
With outlook tradecraft, we
applied the same discipline

283
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,265
and rigor to anticipating
and predicting future events

284
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,934
as we did to receiving
the information.

285
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,637
We don't have complete certainty
about what will happen.

286
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,506
So we have to be very careful

287
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,843
about distinguishing
fact from judgment.

288
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,147
Identifying what
might happen helps

289
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,782
to mitigate the
inherent uncertainty

290
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,018
in intelligence analysis.

291
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,920
And we can do that
in three ways.

292
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,688
We address plausible
developments,

293
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:46,292
what might happen and what
mitigations we could use.

294
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,327
We use evidence-based reasoning

295
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,163
and we use estimative language.

296
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,800
Best practices for using
estimative language.

297
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,771
Avoid jargon, avoid
speculation, avoid citing

298
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,274
unrealistic odds
and avoid phrases

299
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,944
that compound
uncertainty and confusion

300
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,046
like this gentleman
in the cartoon here.

301
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:14,353
Facts and sourcing,
direct evidence is best,

302
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,155
but we don't always
have that luxury,

303
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,122
so that requires us
to have a process

304
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,626
for vetting sources
and information.

305
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:24,029
So when I was with the FBI,

306
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,999
we used to routinely
get walk-ins.

307
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,835
People who would come in and
want to offer us information

308
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,405
and one woman in
particular was extremely,

309
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,007
she was very thoughtful
and trying to be helpful.

310
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,943
She called in and said
that Osama bin Laden

311
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,912
was living in her attic.

312
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,414
And yeah that would be
great if it were that easy,

313
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,184
but, so we had a process where

314
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,353
we went and interviewed her
and investigated her house

315
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,689
and he wasn't there in fact.

316
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,925
But the corollary for
what we do is similar.

317
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,761
You have to have a
process to go through

318
00:14:55,761 --> 00:15:00,733
and say is our initial
assumption correct or not?

319
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,002
We have to vet our sources.

320
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,371
So in vetting sources
we need to distinguish

321
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:09,574
between information,
fact, and judgment.

322
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,477
And we have to take
into account the

323
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,512
substantive complexity of
what we're dealing with.

324
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,582
The more complicated an issue,

325
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,920
the greater the demand to
establish that it's factual.

326
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,289
So as a rule on
controversial matters,

327
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,025
we place the emphasis
on relevant information,

328
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,228
not the estimative conclusions.

329
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:33,198
And this is a real
sticking point for me.

330
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,300
I think it's very important.

331
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,569
Don't take part in
victim blaming or shaming

332
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,704
or naming and shaming.

333
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,675
I think we see a lot of
that on social media,

334
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,376
and I think it's
really poor form,

335
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:48,012
and I think it is the height
of lack of professionalism.

336
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,083
So when you're looking for
sources for your reporting,

337
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,385
I would say don't be
involved with that

338
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,555
and don't utilize
resources that do that.

339
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,324
Failure to properly vet
your resources and facts,

340
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,494
it leads to fear
uncertainty and doubt FUD.

341
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,799
And that's the antithesis of
the intel analyst process,

342
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,334
and this is a great example.

343
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,035
This happened September 2018,

344
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:15,040
when there were gas pipeline
explosions in the Boston area.

345
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,876
There were still
explosions going on,

346
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,278
and people were
on Twitter saying

347
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,913
that it was a cyber attack.

348
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,748
It's irresponsible.

349
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,249
So don't speculate.

350
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,152
Most consumers understand
the complexity of what we do.

351
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,356
So write to that level not
to the purveyors of FUD.

352
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,057
Never exaggerate what's known,

353
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,726
and report gaps in information

354
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,028
and relevant
information that may

355
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,497
contradict your conclusions.

356
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,897
Analytic expertise.

357
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,601
The demonstration of in-depth
substantive knowledge

358
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,137
is the key to differentiate
our products from others,

359
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:50,141
such as intel
providers, journalists,
vendors, you name it.

360
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:51,977
We are what we know.

361
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,181
So we convey analytic
expertise by citing evidence

362
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,552
of previous research,
scholarship or
personal experience.

363
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:05,089
We understand consumers
timeline and priorities

364
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,260
and by utilizing a
diverse set of skills.

365
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,963
It's essential to learn
as much as possible

366
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,065
to speak the language
of our field,

367
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,801
but it's exceedingly rare
for any single individual

368
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,070
to be an expert
across all domains.

369
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,107
It makes it very important for
us to cultivate relationships

370
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,310
and build teams that represent
a diversity of experience,

371
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,981
experience, skills,
and interests.

372
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:35,754
So in about a year
and a half ago,

373
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:41,727
there was a great hashtag on
Twitter, #unqualifiedfortech.

374
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,695
And I would encourage people
to take a look at that

375
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,998
if you hadn't followed
it at the time.

376
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,134
It's a really great
reminder that there are some

377
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,304
wonderful people in security,
who maybe came through

378
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,839
non-traditional avenues,

379
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,341
and they're doing great
things for the field.

380
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,609
That's something
to keep in mind.

381
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,345
Everybody has something
that they can offer

382
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,815
and you really want to
look for those skillsets

383
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,884
that maybe you wouldn't have
considered in the first place.

384
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,890
Number seven, effective summary.

385
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,126
That's basically the
purpose of your product,

386
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,161
why we write what we do?

387
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,563
So what are your key takeaways?

388
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,998
Does your product
specify a call to action

389
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,067
that your consumer should take?

390
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,272
Effective summary identifies
what's new and why it matters.

391
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,908
It highlights the value added
and it supports the value

392
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,712
added with subject
matter expertise.

393
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,449
We create effective summary
by fitting the writing style

394
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,384
to the audience and the purpose,

395
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,087
by concentrating on
what's new and important

396
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,923
and by making the
summary actionable.

397
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,391
So some considerations.

398
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,795
The format should be BLUF,
bottom line up front,

399
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,797
because most readers
aren't going to read past

400
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,232
your first page.

401
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,502
Your writing style, don't
assume that since your audience

402
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,805
is non-technical that
they're not smart.

403
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,108
And then also utilize
a diversity of layout,

404
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,811
text, tables, pictures to
make it easier to read,

405
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,880
especially if you have
really dense material.

406
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,088
So, number eight,
implementation analysis.

407
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,258
Presenting results of the
analytic process in a way

408
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,094
that underscores the
professional analysis.

409
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,697
We talk a lot about this
in Cyber Threat Intel.

410
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,266
We call them structured
analytic techniques,

411
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,004
but basically it's just
rigorous argumentation.

412
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,406
Structured analytic
techniques don't guarantee

413
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,110
analytic precision, but they
do improve the usefulness,

414
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,812
sophistication, and
credibility of assessments.

415
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,617
Examples include brainstorming,
alternative competing

416
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,754
hypotheses, and use
of outside experts.

417
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,656
And really the key here
is how the analysts

418
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,258
reach the evaluations
of alternatives,

419
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,828
can be just as important as
the evaluations themselves.

420
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,202
The value of structured
analytic techniques,

421
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,406
they identify alternatives,
facilitate divergent thinking,

422
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,342
and present results in a way
that underscore analysis.

423
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,480
So while I was preparing
this presentation,

424
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,083
I found this great image online

425
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,886
that's actually the watch
floor where I used to work

426
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,955
at Air Intelligence Agency.

427
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,157
Surprising what's
available on Google,

428
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,092
but that was my first
job out of tech school

429
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,461
as a second lieutenant.

430
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,430
I was briefing a
two-star general,

431
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,765
and it just so
happened I in-processed

432
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:38,170
the week that the general
was out processing.

433
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,205
That general at the
time was a two-star guy

434
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,107
named Major General Hayden.

435
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,243
So as a second lieutenant,
I would have been briefing

436
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,043
General Hayden by one week.

437
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,313
And not daunting at all.

438
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,482
We knew even then
at the time that

439
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,252
he was nowhere near being
done with his career.

440
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,821
But I talked to my boss.

441
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,923
I had a great boss at the time,

442
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,224
and said, you know
how do I go about

443
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,527
standing in front of him
and make an assessment?

444
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,830
And she said basically
what we just talked

445
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,331
about with structured
analytic techniques.

446
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,601
If you have a process
and rigorous thought

447
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,503
and you can go
through and repeat it,

448
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,107
then it's a valid conclusion.

449
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,109
So the assessment itself
wasn't necessarily

450
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,279
as important as the
critical thinking process,

451
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,648
and being repeatable
and reliable.

452
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,186
Number nine, conclusions.

453
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,822
Information rarely
speaks for itself.

454
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,758
Gaps and inconsistencies
are the rule and conclusions

455
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,497
are where the real value of
intelligence comes to bear.

456
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,132
The key events have
to be identified

457
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,034
from among the ordinary.

458
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,269
Underlying patterns have
to be identified from

459
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,139
seemingly disparate
pieces of information,

460
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,242
and the reliable sources
have to be distinguished

461
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,577
from the self-serving.

462
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,681
We also want to identify any
major shifts in conclusion.

463
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,683
If we made one conclusion
and now we're changing that

464
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,051
we want to identify that.

465
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,585
And the analyst
should also share

466
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,387
their reasonable doubts.

467
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,456
Don't project thin
information as a conclusion.

468
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,995
So number 10,
counter-intelligence.

469
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,429
I believe that
counterintelligence could be

470
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,368
a whole presentation of its own,

471
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,904
but as part of the
analytic tradecraft,

472
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,372
we will include that today.

473
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,041
Traditional counterintelligence
means trying

474
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,577
to frustrate somebody else's
intelligence operation,

475
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,746
but for the purpose
of this presentation,

476
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,917
counterintelligence means
identifying adversary deception.

477
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,319
Pretty simplistic
view of counter intel,

478
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,322
but it'll work for our
presentation today.

479
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,626
The main weapons for
protecting the integrity of...

480
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,237
The main weapons for
protecting the integrity

481
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,374
of the analytic process.

482
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,008
One, adjust for speed

483
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,912
and adjust the balance
of speed and care.

484
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,647
We want to rush to judgment.

485
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,182
We want to be quick
and there is a pressure

486
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,651
and there's a tension
to make an assessment.

487
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,653
But you don't want to
jump to conclusions

488
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,123
like we talked about previously.

489
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,657
You want to maintain skepticism

490
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,693
about the reliability
of the information

491
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,961
you're dealing with.

492
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,030
And you need to have a
readiness to challenge

493
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,966
and test even
well-established assumptions

494
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,602
about trends and patterns

495
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,338
and cause-and-effect
relationships.

496
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,875
So be aware that somebody's
trying to deceive you.

497
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:38,150
So last story, when
I was with the FBI,

498
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,318
we had a high-profile case.

499
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,487
It was a counterterrorism
case that was

500
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,724
in the Presidential Daily
Brief for a few days.

501
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,828
And the task force
was assembled.

502
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:54,199
We got to a point
where there was action

503
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,700
that needed to be taken.

504
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,702
So the investigating agent
approached the subject

505
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,338
and said hey would you be
willing to come talk to us,

506
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,941
and he was, so we all
got together and flew out

507
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,644
to support the investigation.

508
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:10,649
And I walked into the hotel.

509
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,717
I checked into the hotel,

510
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,419
and as I walked into the lobby

511
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,088
I looked and I saw the
individual standing in the lobby

512
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,191
flirting with the
front desk attendant

513
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,026
and stopped dead in my tracks,

514
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:25,564
because I had 20 years of
research on this individual

515
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:29,634
at my desk and understanding
his means and motives,

516
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:34,639
and tactics and I couldn't
believe that I was coming

517
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,609
face to face with this
person that I'd spent

518
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,477
so much time researching.

519
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,315
So fast forward, we go do the
investigation the next day

520
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:48,286
and every time the
investigator asked a question

521
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,856
that was sensitive or that
it was clear the individual

522
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,392
didn't want to answer, he
kept saying a certain phrase.

523
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,262
The investigator didn't
didn't speak the subject's

524
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,732
same language, but
somebody on the team did.

525
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,101
Going back to having
a diverse skill set,

526
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,604
having a linguist on the
team was really helpful,

527
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,607
and she identified that
any time the investigator

528
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,142
asked a question
that was sensitive,

529
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,079
the subject would
give an answer,

530
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,647
and then he would
say the word lie.

531
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,749
So he was really
brazen about it,

532
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,851
because he figured nobody
spoke that same language,

533
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,319
they wouldn't know
what he was saying,

534
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,655
but fortunately we had
somebody on the team

535
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,224
that saw that immediately,

536
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,926
and that was also
really valuable to know,

537
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,263
okay that's where we want to
focus on our future questions,

538
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,631
but the key takeaway there being

539
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,901
when you're researching
a threat actor,

540
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,169
understand that
deception is part of it,

541
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,173
and it's very likely that what
you see might not be truth,

542
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:46,011
and there might be an
attempt to deceive.

543
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,248
So in conclusion, I just
wanted to give you a high-level

544
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,885
overview of some intelligence
analytic tradecraft,

545
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,955
and how it could
apply to threat intel,

546
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,258
and some of my personal
experiences with it.

547
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,728
But I want you to take away that

548
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,331
adopting high
professional standards,

549
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,033
maintaining analytic integrity,

550
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,101
and being candidly
self-critical is really helpful

551
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,873
and necessary in
professionalizing our field.

552
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,443
Great, thank you all
so much for your time.

553
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,613
(audience applauding)

554
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,917
(upbeat music)
