1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,769
(calm music)

2
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,412
(applause)

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,683
- Hi everyone,

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,786
So, not the immediate,
post lunch period,

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,254
but we're gonna
talk a little bit

6
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,789
about something that's
near and dear to my heart

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,491
for reasons that I hope will
become a little bit apparent

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,926
called threat
indications and warning,

9
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,328
so first, a little bit about me.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,797
I am a network defender
first and foremost,

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,334
so I got my start in this
field in the U.S. Navy.

12
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,469
Did that for five, six
yearsish, or whatever,

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,571
and then went over to Los
Alamos National Laboratory,

14
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,774
where I ran the
incidence response team,

15
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,676
so very much U.S.
government focused.

16
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,179
However, now I kinda
do the same thing,

17
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,647
but more or less
on my own terms,

18
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,382
so I'm working for a
company called Dragos,

19
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,518
which may be somewhat
involved with CTI summit.

20
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,220
Might have a hand in
running said organization,

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,588
so he's my boss, and
I have to be nice

22
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,190
and maybe say something
nice about the company

23
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,660
at some point, but anyway,
that's kinda where I am now,

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,030
but like I said before, my
background was a naval officer,

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,732
and he's like oh,
you're at a CTI summit.

26
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,435
You musta been a naval
intelligence officer.

27
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,336
Well, you know, not
really, actually,

28
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,138
so this is always, kind
of, what I've thought

29
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,373
about intelligence analysts.

30
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,641
Not to say that
that's a bad thing,

31
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,843
but that really wasn't
me 'cause if you look

32
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,511
at how the Navy
organizes things,

33
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,914
is that there's this overall
information dominance,

34
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,183
I don't know what the
hell they call it now,

35
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,819
anymore, actually,
community that includes

36
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,522
the weather guessers, the
information professionals,

37
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,491
and whatnot, but it also
includes intelligence

38
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,759
and then in a
separate career track,

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,328
that I was in, called
information warfare,

40
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,563
and the reason why
that's important

41
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,231
is because that
community really dealt

42
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,967
with technical information
to try and provide

43
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,170
to the war fighter, to drop
a sort of DoDish buzzword

44
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,040
immediately, as much
actionable information

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,409
as immediate as possible,
with just enough information

46
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,479
to make it actionable, so really
trying to be time sensitive

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,981
and relevant, and that's
why I'm here today,

48
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,183
because what we're
going to talk about is,

49
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,319
from an agenda perspective,
just what's the role

50
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,787
and purpose of intelligence.

51
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,689
That might seem like a
nonstarter in this crowd,

52
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,023
that well, everyone
knows what the purpose

53
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,458
of intelligence is.

54
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,627
Well, it's good to remind
ourselves what that actually is

55
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,862
to make sure that
we don't wander

56
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,930
into self-licking
ice cream cone land,

57
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,899
but then in looking
at that, let's examine

58
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,568
exactly what intelligence
operations are

59
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,270
in the state of the
now, how that's applied

60
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,272
in a CTI sense, and then
what that leaves out

61
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,274
or what that might
leave to be desired

62
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,710
as result, and then
go into an explanation

63
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,913
of what I feel to encompass
indications and warning

64
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:31,518
within a cyber defense
set or mindset,

65
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,953
and then we'll look at a
couple of recentish examples

66
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,989
for how this might be
applied in practice

67
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,324
and some recommendations,
so first off,

68
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,227
why intelligence, so everyone
makes fun of this quote,

69
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,730
but this little bit of
Heideggerian wisdom here

70
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,533
that Mr. Rumsfeld
issued once upon a time

71
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,233
really does kinda get at
the crux of the problem,

72
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,936
like okay, we know the
things that we know.

73
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,437
Fine, that's all well and good.

74
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,972
It's nice to try and
fill in those gaps

75
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,108
that we're already aware of,
but then in a longer term

76
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,676
perspective, like, well
what are the things

77
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,077
that we're not even aware of
yet that are on the horizon?

78
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,114
What are the items that are
gonna be developing over time

79
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,283
that we need to make sure
that we either develop

80
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,920
collections for or gain
some sort of visibility on.

81
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,488
Now, that's all well and good,
sort of in a frictionless,

82
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,858
spinning in the void,
vacuum sense or whatever,

83
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,626
but in order for
that to be grounded,

84
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,094
intelligence to be meaningful,

85
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,596
intelligence to
be anything other

86
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,567
than just its own, little,
self-massaging exercise,

87
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,801
you could swap
about another M word

88
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,403
for that if you
have a dirty mind,

89
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,738
is to make sure that you're
supporting operations.

90
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,440
Intelligence that
just kind of exists

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,009
for its own sake, what
does that actually do?

92
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,511
What does that actually provide?

93
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,146
Like, it might provide an
interesting book report,

94
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,547
and this is where I
make fun of the guys

95
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,115
at, like, the Office
of Naval Intelligence,

96
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,383
like oh, that's a cool report.

97
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,918
That would have
been great to see

98
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,353
about a year ago when I was
actually dealing with this.

99
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,056
It's still good stuff,
but identify who is it

100
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,792
that I'm trying to support
from the strategic level,

101
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,695
the people who are sitting
in the really high offices

102
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,863
with the fancy suits
or fancier suits

103
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,533
or lots of strips on
their things and whatnot,

104
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,236
or is it the people who are
really low down in the weeds,

105
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,769
that actually need
to act on something

106
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,406
within the next hour, maybe
even the next 15 minutes,

107
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,808
and how am I producing a product

108
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,775
that's relevant to the
needs of the audience?

109
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,979
This was brought up earlier
in Amy's discussion.

110
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,047
Know who you're communicating to

111
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,716
and why you're
communicating to them.

112
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,485
What is my customer, and
what are their needs?

113
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,721
And so as a result of that,
at each of these levels

114
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,322
of support that you're providing

115
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,358
to different types of operations
or different consumers,

116
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,693
intelligence, to be
relevant, has to be,

117
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,663
well, relevant is one
of the items up here,

118
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,032
but in addition to that, it
needs to be timely for the scope

119
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,435
and what you're trying to
discuss and accurate, of course.

120
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,471
If you start getting
crap information,

121
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,872
you're not gonna
have a very good

122
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,008
or happy consumer for very long,

123
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,143
and applying these to the
different types of intelligence,

124
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,578
so okay, strategic intelligence,

125
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,345
and I think Mitch just
did a good example

126
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,482
of talking about that
in the previous talk.

127
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,151
Let's get an idea for what's
going on in the big picture.

128
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,653
What's happening
out in the world?

129
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,088
How does this apply to my,
thinking of what I need

130
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,323
to plan out for the next year.

131
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,957
Maybe even five years from now,

132
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,295
what's the overall
thrust of events?

133
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,430
Well, then at a slightly
lower level to events

134
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,198
in question, you get
the operational level.

135
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,669
How are we gonna organize
my day-to-day battle rhythm,

136
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,506
my cycles of events, my
actions on a daily basis?

137
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,041
What sort of things do
I need to look out for?

138
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,010
What are the adversary's
tendencies, behaviors?

139
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,277
How are these emerging?

140
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,713
And then, at the lowest level,

141
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,715
and most immediate level,
at a tactical level,

142
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,051
this incident is
happening right now.

143
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,286
This event happened
five minutes ago.

144
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,855
In order to try to get
to those magic numbers

145
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,325
of minimizing
adversary dwell time

146
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,527
or getting your best
possible time to detection

147
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,564
for a malicious event, how
am I providing information

148
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,100
that's going to enable
a defender to respond

149
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,601
in the most immediate
sense in order

150
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,304
to disadvantage the adversary
and advantage the defense

151
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,306
to have, you know, be able
to win that engagement?

152
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,944
So, I think this slide comes
up in the SANS CTI class.

153
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,346
I've never taken this class.

154
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,315
Rob likes this one a lot too,
so I'll throw it in here,

155
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,651
but it's important to note
because it defines a general,

156
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,654
sort of funnel that we're
used to between raw data

157
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,589
and then magic
happens or whatever,

158
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,358
and at the very end
of this pipeline,

159
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,793
the sausage is made, and
you have intelligence.

160
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,930
When looked at from a cyber
threat intelligence perspective,

161
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,232
though, what are we really
focused on, typically?

162
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,601
We do a really
good job with data.

163
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,437
Swap out data for IOCs,
and it's an argument,

164
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,139
like, IOC is actually
an enriched data set,

165
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,440
but not the way it's used.

166
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,109
We'll talk about
that in a second,

167
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,144
and then we talk about the
pretty intelligence reports

168
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,779
that come at the end.

169
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,814
What you'll notice,
though, is that phase one,

170
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,450
collect all the
things, phase two,

171
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,187
phase three, produce intel.

172
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,789
Something happens
in the middle there,

173
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,358
and maybe we're missing
something as a result,

174
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,260
so from an intelligence
reporting standpoint,

175
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,995
I think everyone in the
room is familiar with it

176
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,297
because we see these often
in marketing attempt.

177
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,700
I'm sorry, public
intelligence reports,

178
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,569
for examples of
campaigns or intrusions,

179
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,238
and I do intelligence
work right now,

180
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,672
and I produce some
of these reports,

181
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,274
so I'm happy to call myself
out for this as well,

182
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,411
but it is what it is, but
malware analysis reports

183
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,813
and other sorts of
items that are produced

184
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,115
after an event takes
place and following

185
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,419
a not insignificant period
of analysis and production,

186
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,486
so we have lots of
headline examples,

187
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,689
and I'll let everyone guess
which one is the bad example

188
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,492
of this group of four,
but in looking at this,

189
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,295
like this seminal, APT
1 report, for example.

190
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,697
That was released
after years of work

191
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,667
into an intrusion set
and ongoing activity,

192
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,835
so it was, you know,
defined the field,

193
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,304
for lack of another
way of looking at it,

194
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,339
and so you can't
discount it at all,

195
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,675
and I don't want to in
any way, shape, or form,

196
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,076
but in the sense
of what it provided

197
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,479
for defenders, it
provided a great overview

198
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,748
of past observed activity, some
of which was still ongoing,

199
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,150
but for those who
had been impacted

200
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,585
and were out Mandiant customers
during that engagement,

201
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,987
they were kind of
left out in the breeze

202
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,024
and had to make do on their own.

203
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,792
Okay, so what about something
a little more immediate?

204
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,294
Well, we're all familiar with
indicators of compromise.

205
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,497
I think every time someone
says indicators of compromise,

206
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,332
Kevin Mandia makes $5.

207
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,202
As a result of
that, we have this,

208
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,304
in an ideal sense,
you want continuous,

209
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,440
contextual observations,
but unfortunately,

210
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,342
in practice, and I'm sure
we're all used to this,

211
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,411
a lotta times when
we see an IOC,

212
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,446
it's something that's
just sort of out there

213
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,281
on its own, absent
the sort of context

214
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,750
that we need to make
it ideally actionable.

215
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,153
While its purpose
is to facilitate

216
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,655
speedy information
exchange, which is good.

217
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,791
Timeliness could
be highly variable,

218
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,759
and that accuracy component
that we talked about

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,296
can be less than ideal,
depending upon your sources,

220
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,533
so as designed, IOCs started
out as a really great idea,

221
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,202
like, let's try and
provide an enriched means

222
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,438
of detecting and
communicating threat data,

223
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,473
organized around
technical observables.

224
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,475
Like, we can do a whole
'nother talk about this,

225
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,043
which we don't have
time for right now,

226
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,845
but there's something
to be said for that

227
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,881
as a concept, and we probably
never really explored it

228
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,781
as deeply as we
could or should have

229
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,385
because in practice, this
is what IOCs look like.

230
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,020
This is the Grizzly
Steppe report,

231
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,756
the first one, which everyone
likes to kick while it's down,

232
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,826
and as you can see here, the
enrichment is completely blank

233
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,361
for most of these items as well,

234
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,464
so you just get a bunch of
IPs, domains, hashes, etc.

235
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,431
Like, what do these do?

236
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,366
I dunno.

237
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,600
Maybe we should block 'em.

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,835
Well, the problem
is that as you start

239
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,170
getting this generation
of indicators

240
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,106
that are then passed
and forwarded around,

241
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,574
it's like well,
we wanna make sure

242
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,041
that we're acting on these
as timely as possible,

243
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,044
so let's automate our
sharing and maybe automate

244
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,946
our blocking response actions.

245
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,983
That sounds great, except
you wanna block Google,

246
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,084
that's how you block
Google, and I'm not saying

247
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,987
that that's any one
particular organization

248
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,222
is better or worse than another.

249
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,757
I've made mistakes
on this as well.

250
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,224
Like, oh, this IP popped up.

251
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,727
Like, oh, it actually hosts,
like 30,000 other sites,

252
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,963
including Catherine's
blog on cats

253
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,266
and Jim's stationary
business and whatnot

254
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,068
as well as this malicious stuff,

255
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,038
so there's a lot of scope to
have errors take place here

256
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,573
that generate both
false positives

257
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,475
and also give the sense of
a false sense of security

258
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,677
that oh, I blocked
all these hashes.

259
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,011
I'm good on that, Lee.

260
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,746
I recompiled this in a
different environment,

261
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,247
and then you used UPX on it.

262
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,716
Bye bye hash matching.

263
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,586
So, from an intelligence
coverage perspective,

264
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,021
IOCs are nice in that they
allow for quick alerting

265
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,923
and sharing but at
the cost of accuracy

266
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,258
and context in a lotta times.

267
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,359
I have a hash that's out there.

268
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,427
What does it mean?

269
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,096
Reports are thorough by design.

270
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,764
Hopefully they're
thorough by design,

271
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,232
but they're historical in nature

272
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,302
and typically arrive long
after a campaign is complete,

273
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,571
so it's nice to get a
perspective on what's going on

274
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,640
within the environment, how
these threats have evolved

275
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,408
over time, but if I'm
trying to use that

276
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,544
as the basis of my
day-to-day operations,

277
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,145
my day-to-day defense
of the network,

278
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,414
it's not gonna do me
all that much good,

279
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,583
so our current gap
is in the middle,

280
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,884
hence the title of this talk.

281
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,654
It was not simply
randomly chosen,

282
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,155
so there's this
information step,

283
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,290
where we've enriched
data to some degree,

284
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,692
but we haven't gone all the way

285
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,161
into producing a full-scale
intelligence report.

286
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,097
In this sense, we
really want to make sure

287
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,732
that we're supporting
operations.

288
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,370
In that sense, daily operations
needs intelligence feedback.

289
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,073
This is a very important
aspect of how we can insure

290
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,908
that we're not just
constantly reacting,

291
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,443
but trying to stay
on that bleeding edge

292
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,246
as attackers evolve and
adapt their capabilities

293
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,516
and specific instantiations
of behaviors over time.

294
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,218
Raw indicators are insufficient
for doing this, though,

295
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,888
and finalized intelligence
is not timely.

296
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,390
We need something
that bridges the gap

297
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,092
between the two, providing
enriched information

298
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,662
with an indication and
warning of threat behavior

299
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,864
that can be both informative
and time sensitive

300
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,465
within certain parameters.

301
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,967
That's a lotta words, isn't it?

302
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,367
Where does this even come from?

303
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,504
Well, like I said
before, I was a crypie

304
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,774
in the military sense and
not an intelligence officer

305
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,344
in the classic sense, and
in my past background,

306
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,580
indications and warning
relates to, most often,

307
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,150
time sensitive signals,
intelligence information

308
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,785
passed to tactical
units, out forward

309
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,155
in order to allow them to
react in near real time

310
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,091
to events as they unfold,
sharing just enough information

311
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:37,096
that allows for a
ship at sea, aircraft,

312
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,298
tactical unit on
the ground, etc.

313
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,500
to know that hey, this
radar at this bearing

314
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,670
in this range also is
associated to this platform,

315
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,972
and it's doing this
right here and now.

316
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,507
That doesn't say,
like, well, I know

317
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:53,478
that the, you know, pick a,
the Russian Northern Fleet

318
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,248
or whatever is currently in
the middle of an exercise.

319
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,316
Well okay, that's
all well and good.

320
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,584
That's the intelligence report,

321
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,151
but like hey, I at
least need to know,

322
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,621
or whatever, that this ship
is underway out of its port.

323
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,923
That's something that
I need to react to

324
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,624
in somewhat near real
time and not wait

325
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,094
for the final
assessment afterwards

326
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,196
'cause really what
we're trying to do is,

327
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,265
just as we talk about the
stream of alerts or warnings

328
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,300
that come into a
SOC environment,

329
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,769
is we're trying to
provide information

330
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,505
that allows defensive
teams to formulate

331
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,309
and tailor their responsive
and defensive posture,

332
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,910
towards what's going on
in their environment,

333
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,812
so that you're not
surprised by something,

334
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,148
but also to try and ensure
that you're not overreacting

335
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,950
to every little
thing, so just saying

336
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,885
that, like, oop, range
bearing signal, react.

337
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,487
Well okay, that
doesn't tell me much,

338
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,289
but if I can add a little
bit more context around that,

339
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,959
like oh, this particular
radar is associated

340
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,294
with this platform, which
happens to be the same sort

341
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,430
of platform that is capable
of flying X number of,

342
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,533
you know range, and
carrying this variety

343
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,068
of anti-ship missile.

344
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,704
Suddenly, the people down in
the combat information center,

345
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,372
they care a lot more about that
little piece of information

346
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,941
than they would if
I had just provided,

347
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,078
like, yep, we've got something
out over the water over here,

348
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,913
but how does this relate to CTI?

349
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,414
The gentleman is
in the audience,

350
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,317
and I'm gonna quote his
book, so Richard Bejtlich

351
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,853
provided in The Tao of
Network Security Monitoring,

352
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,122
which everyone in this
room has read, I'm sure.

353
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,091
If you haven't, you
should fix that,

354
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,561
but trying to relate the
concept of how I&W works

355
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,530
within the military
scope and trying to see

356
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,033
how that relates to
the practice of CTI.

357
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,169
I think this was a
initial step for it,

358
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,904
and not to criticize
him, but it's like oh,

359
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,039
there's a whole lot more
that we can talk about here,

360
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,374
which is what we're going to do,

361
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,009
so this isn't necessarily
a new concept,

362
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,311
but I think it's a
criminally underexplored one,

363
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,780
and maybe it's a little
bit too military centric,

364
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,615
but it's an idea that, I think,

365
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,417
really satisfies a glaring need

366
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,053
in how we're tailoring
intelligence operations

367
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,589
to the actual practice
of network defense

368
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,591
because if we're
differentiating indications

369
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,827
and warnings from
traditional CTI,

370
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,361
we're avoiding attribution.

371
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,463
Now we're certainly enriching
information with a little bit

372
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,400
about what a specific
indication might mean.

373
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,303
You know, that this malware
is capable of this behavior,

374
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,506
but I don't necessarily
care that it's Fancy Bear,

375
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,108
Goblin Panda, Fozzie
Bear, whatever.

376
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,878
I just care that
this is associated

377
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,112
with this sort of attack.

378
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,781
Here's where it lies
on the kill chain,

379
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,150
or because it's a
security conference,

380
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,385
it aligns to these
attack methods,

381
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,021
and how does that then allow
me to tailor my response?

382
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,958
I don't want to necessarily
get adversary intent.

383
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,860
Like, this is going
after the nuclear secrets

384
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,596
at the, you know, DOE
National Laboratory.

385
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,664
Like, maybe they are,
but at least I can orient

386
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,500
around what I'm seeing from
that technical observable,

387
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,169
what I should
maybe plan for next

388
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,670
in terms of defensive response

389
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,006
'cause what I wanna focus
on is really differentiating

390
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,440
and categorizing threats.

391
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,775
Is this something
that's wormable?

392
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,377
Is it something that
is going to require

393
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,811
interactive operation?

394
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,614
What are the next steps
that would be chained

395
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,816
to what I observed
within my environment,

396
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,218
and what other sort of
items can I relate that to

397
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,752
from a response standpoint?

398
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,923
Thus informing defenders
and enabling a more educated

399
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,158
and more tailored response
to what's being seen

400
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,027
instead of just oop,
we caught malware.

401
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,095
Wipe and rebuild the box.

402
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:56,929
Close the ticket.

403
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,163
We're good and done.

404
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,065
That's never a really
good answer, by the way,

405
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,501
but having said that,
this isn't to say

406
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,670
that CTI has no role whatsoever.

407
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,640
Rather, this is all part
of the circle of life,

408
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,375
the circle of incidence response

409
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,977
in cyber threat
intelligence, so really,

410
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,480
you could look at this
as being intelligence

411
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,282
provides that
strategic overview.

412
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,983
What is the lay of the land,

413
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,484
and where are our
adversaries going?

414
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,321
What are we observing in
adversary trade craft,

415
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,923
and communicating
that information down

416
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,026
to your SOC personnel,
your incidence responders,

417
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,295
or to a dedicated,
sort of, indications

418
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,097
and warning personnel, that
sort of technical inject

419
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,367
into the response
feed, and then insuring

420
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,402
that the day-to-day
operations are supported

421
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,571
by shaping what's observed then

422
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,640
in available telemetry
in light of what we know

423
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,509
about the broader
intelligence picture,

424
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,844
so providing that enhanced,
sort of, information,

425
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,681
so that when a raw IOC
pops up, I can orient that

426
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,349
based upon the broader
intelligence picture

427
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,917
to what that means in practice,

428
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,419
and hopefully I
can do that in less

429
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,055
than half an hour every
time every time, ideally.

430
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,723
That's never gonna
happen, but we can try,

431
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,727
so having said that, at the
same time I&W provides feedback

432
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,728
to traditional cyber threat
intelligence, though,

433
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,432
because it allows
traditional intelligence

434
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,834
to then see how the
environment is evolving,

435
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,002
what's going on in terms
of attacker trade craft

436
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,938
and behaviors, so
that it can then form

437
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,106
an iterative process.

438
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,608
That intelligence
remains broadly relevant

439
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,877
and continuously
up-to-date but then ensures

440
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,380
that it's also feeding back
down to day-to-day operations

441
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,884
so that your SOC personnel,
your incidence responder, etc.

442
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,219
doesn't have to wait six months

443
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,688
for the biannual
intelligence review

444
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,991
or well after a certain
incident is done

445
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,626
in order to incorporate
that into what they're doing

446
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,196
tactically on a
day-to-day basis,

447
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,564
so really what we're looking for

448
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,933
is this nice,
little, gooey center

449
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,103
of a overall defensive process,

450
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,904
where you have cyber
threat intelligence

451
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,340
connected to day-to-day
security operations

452
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,877
through a enrichment based
upon what operational needs

453
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:52,710
are required.

454
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,347
That makes sense
for everyone, right?

455
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,814
If it doesn't, that's okay
because we're gonna talk

456
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,751
about some examples now and
how this might look in practice

457
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,420
and where we might get
better, so to start off with,

458
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,954
I'm gonna wear the
hair shirt on something

459
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,691
that I worked on
as well as ESET.

460
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,926
Again, I don't think Rob
Lee is involved at all

461
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,230
in SANS events, so
Crashoverride Industroyer

462
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,831
is complete news for
everyone in this room,

463
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,465
but for those who don't know,

464
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,368
this was the 2016
Ukraine power event.

465
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,704
Multiple people worked on it.

466
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,740
This seems like it was
fairly well covered,

467
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,242
but if you look at
the timeline here,

468
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,711
the event itself happened
December of 2016.

469
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,212
Okay, power went out.

470
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,415
Power went out in 2015 as
well, and it ended up being

471
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,216
the result of a cyber intrusion,

472
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,784
or however you wanna phrase it.

473
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,354
Maybe this one was as well,
and as early as January,

474
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,223
we were getting hints that,
like, yep, it's cyber.

475
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,658
Like well, we need a
little bit of evidence.

476
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,126
I want someone to
prove this to me,

477
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:45,697
but it probably is cyber,
but then it wasn't until June

478
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,699
of that year that
ESET and Dragos,

479
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,769
again, disclosure, my
current employer, Dragos,

480
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,337
publicly disclosed
what happened,

481
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,772
and even then, if you
looked at what happened,

482
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,643
the information was mostly
around an ICS specific tool set,

483
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,712
so if you're orienting this
around the cyber kill chain,

484
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,948
or the ICS cyber kill
chain, specifically,

485
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,617
we got information about what
happened at the very end.

486
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,753
We didn't get any information
for how they laterally moved

487
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,288
into that environment.

488
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,957
No information about how they
got into the ICS environment,

489
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,026
let alone how the IT
environment was breached

490
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,761
and what movement
happened there.

491
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,697
That didn't happen until,
and this is only going

492
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,632
off of public reporting,
October of 2018,

493
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,369
where a white paper
was published by me

494
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,473
that went into a larger data set

495
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,541
that was made available
that accompanied

496
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,743
a lot that intrusion
information,

497
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,412
and it was really
only at that step

498
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,682
that you could really provide
any sort of threat indication

499
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,383
and warning for how
this attack took place

500
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,385
and how someone could
defend against it,

501
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,921
so from a raw data
sharing perspective,

502
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,324
if we're trying to do
this on a timely basis,

503
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,493
I'm happy to say that's
a complete failure

504
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,660
because the even
happened in December.

505
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,130
You didn't see your first IOC,

506
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,198
or meaningful IOC, until June.

507
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,667
That's a good seven
months between attack

508
00:18:55,667 --> 00:19:00,238
and identification, where
similarly situated organizations

509
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,007
where pretty much left
twisting in the wind,

510
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,309
so there was really
nothing remotely actionable

511
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,212
put out very shortly
after the event,

512
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,281
so is that a information
sharing failure?

513
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,549
Is that a lack of trust failure?

514
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,185
I don't know, but from a
immediate data sharing,

515
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,820
we didn't do a very
good job there.

516
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,955
From an indications and
warning perspective,

517
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,323
we eventually got to
a point where someone

518
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,261
could have provided
a electric utility

519
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,995
with enough information
to say that hey,

520
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,598
if you see these sorts of
items in your environment,

521
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,567
it might relate to this,
therefore you should try

522
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,702
to orient your response
towards a potential

523
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,770
power outage event.

524
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,572
We got there, but it took over,

525
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,774
well, about a year in
order to make that happen,

526
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,010
and that also seems
unsatisfactory.

527
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,745
From a classic intelligence
perspective, though,

528
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,713
people got marketing
reports out of this.

529
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,683
We had reporting in 2017,
black out presentations.

530
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,718
Again, I took part
in all of this,

531
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,254
so this, I'm wearing
the hair shirt here.

532
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,356
We did a good thing
there, but I don't think

533
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,727
that we sufficiently armed
and augmented defenders

534
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,696
who actually had to
take care of this

535
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,064
to respond in a
meaningful way until much

536
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,000
after the event took place,
and these adversaries

537
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,136
have likely shifted to new ways

538
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,072
of operating, so not so cool.

539
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,506
Let's talk about something
a little more recently

540
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,942
that I didn't work on.

541
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,244
The Shamoon part three
because we always need things

542
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,312
to come in waves, and
Shamoon part three,

543
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,316
much like Return of the Jedi,
was kind of a skimpy knock off

544
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,018
or whatever relevant to the
earlier items in the trilogy,

545
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,788
but at the same time, it
still a destructive event

546
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,024
that hit various oil and
gas related contractors,

547
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,226
didn't hit Aramco this
time, as far as we know,

548
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,628
in the Middle East area.

549
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:34,131
Was covered fairly
extensively quite quickly.

550
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,736
Multiple vendors, so
let's see, Chronicle,

551
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,739
Semantic, McAfee,
who else is up there?

552
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,942
Talos, Unit 42 of Palo Alto,
everyone had a blood post

553
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,978
within a couple of
days of, I think,

554
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,580
the first sign, publicly,
that this was going on,

555
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,183
was a Tweet because
it has to be a Tweet,

556
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,486
and yeah, so from an immediate
response perspective,

557
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,754
like oh, this looks pretty good.

558
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,289
Like, we were getting
information out publicly

559
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,092
to defenders quite rapidly
on how this malware

560
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,960
was operating, how it
differentiated itself

561
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,829
a little bit from
earlier iterations.

562
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,030
That looks pretty good.

563
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,899
Well, then as people
started looking at this

564
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,967
a little bit deeper, its seemed
like there might have been

565
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,403
a little bit more going on here,

566
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,707
so we had multiple
vendors, McAfee, Anomoli,

567
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,409
I'm gonna get to
FireEye in a second.

568
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,846
It's like hey, there's an
APT33 link here, we think.

569
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,614
Like okay, that's interesting,

570
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,417
but at the same time, how are
we getting that information,

571
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,718
and if this is part
of a broader campaign,

572
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,122
then where was the
reporting prior to the,

573
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,890
again, the final
stage of the attack,

574
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,425
delivery of effects on target,

575
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,793
that would have
enabled defenders

576
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,029
to avoid the catastrophic
wiper situation

577
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,765
in their network, so
then we got a report,

578
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,334
and I'm not trying to
say that anyone's doing

579
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,869
a bad job here, so
someone's going to quote me

580
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,971
out of context, like,
Joe shit on FireEye.

581
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,507
No, that's not what
I'm doing here,

582
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,776
so FireEye published
a report that went

583
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,411
a little bit more in depth
for how this would have

584
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,880
played out over time,
which was really good,

585
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,782
but the question
here is, and again,

586
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,684
this is only going off
of public reporting,

587
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,252
how does this
relate, necessarily,

588
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,788
to what we observed in
how this attack developed

589
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,991
over time, and was
sufficient information given

590
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,460
to or provided to defenders
that they could have

591
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,096
taken action on this
before, after the fact,

592
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,365
saying, like, oh, all
your computers got wiped.

593
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,900
Well, here's the story
about why that happened.

594
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,037
Like, thanks, I can brief
my CSO a little better now,

595
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,574
but he's still gonna fire
me, so from that perspective,

596
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,709
did we do a good job?

597
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,243
And my answer here is maybe.

598
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,546
Like on the one hand,
we're certainly seeing

599
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,715
a greater willingness
on the part

600
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,582
of threat intelligence vendors

601
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,752
and other organizations
to really,

602
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,854
whether it's something
like Drunk Binary,

603
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,990
for example, going out
and reporting on hey,

604
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,926
this hash is related
to Fuzzy Snugly Ducks,

605
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,495
induckinator, intrusion
setter, or something like that.

606
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,864
Go look at it.

607
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,798
Well, maybe it's
verified, maybe it's not,

608
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,567
but it's something to dig into,

609
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,869
but the thing is, is that
we really need to make sure

610
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,237
that to provide that truly
actually information,

611
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,441
just finding that it, at
the end of the attack chain,

612
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,244
does very little in order to
empower and improve defense

613
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,045
throughout that entire
sequence of events.

614
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,748
You're really just
leaving organizations

615
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,750
at the mercy of,
like, well hopefully,

616
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,552
we're not the ones who're
going to be on the timer next

617
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,288
for when this wipers going
to go off in our environment,

618
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,524
so to the extent that,
could we have done better?

619
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,959
Well, it really depends
on that APT33 attribution

620
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,928
and what sort of
eyes on target we had

621
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,964
on that behavior over time.

622
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,966
If it's true that
this was part of a,

623
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,667
and it's only certainly the case

624
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,303
this was part of
someone's extensive,

625
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,472
over a period of
time, intrusion,

626
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,241
get into the environment,
figure out what to do

627
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,078
in that environment, and
then drop a cyber weapon

628
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,080
to do nasty stuff or whatever.

629
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,848
Like, yeah, there's probably
multiple touchpoints

630
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,183
that we could have identified,

631
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,918
but if it's a campaign
that we knew about

632
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,553
and that wasn't sufficiently
communicated before the fact,

633
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,756
have we empowered
defense sufficiently

634
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,191
so that they could
have taken action

635
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,394
to prevent the catastrophic
situation at the end?

636
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,863
So, overall, I'd say that
all of us could be doing

637
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,566
a better job here, but the
question is how do we get there.

638
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,901
Of course, not
everything can be public

639
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,469
because I like
paying my mortgage.

640
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,771
I'm sure some of you like
paying your mortgages too,

641
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,540
but there's gotta be
a way of doing this,

642
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,041
so what do we do then?

643
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:07,779
So to wrap this up with some
high level thoughts and etc.,

644
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,316
indications and warning
bridges a critical gap

645
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,318
between that raw data,
which may be accurate,

646
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,554
may be not, doesn't
have much context,

647
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,255
and the complete
intelligence report

648
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,658
that gives the entire
picture of what happened.

649
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,927
Security operations
benefit from this

650
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,228
by having indications
and warning built

651
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,798
into their battle
rhythm, so to speak,

652
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,534
because it allows them
to respond to things

653
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:34,039
more accurately, more
robustly, and to minimize

654
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,274
that sense of dwell
time for the adversary

655
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,210
or enhanced time to
response for the defender.

656
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,812
Unfortunately, in
a lotta respects,

657
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,049
the current CTI process, it's
not that we're deliberately

658
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,750
like, screw those
SOC guys or whatever.

659
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,185
I wanna write my
ten page book report

660
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,653
and submit it to Virus Bulletin.

661
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,455
It's not that we're
doing that necessarily.

662
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,458
It's just there's a
sense of not seeing,

663
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,162
not identifying
where the link occurs

664
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,732
between what we do from an
intelligence analyst perspective

665
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,966
and who it's
actually supporting,

666
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,236
what our audience is,
and what their needs are

667
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,071
to do their jobs
more effectively,

668
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,307
so and finally, for that
process to remain informed,

669
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,476
this isn't saying that
oh, you CTI analysts,

670
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,612
go off to your ivory
tower and do your thing

671
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,146
because it doesn't
matter for operation.

672
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,581
It's like, no, it matters
very much for operations,

673
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,684
but it has to be part of a
broader intelligence cycle

674
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,288
that's built into it a
understanding of and a need

675
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,625
to inform day-to-day
defensive operations,

676
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,129
so if we wanna apply this to
operations, what do we do?

677
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,630
So, from an analyst's
perspective,

678
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,033
whether you're a vendor or
you are an embedded analyst

679
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,302
at an organization,
demand I&W support

680
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,103
or build it out where
it doesn't exist.

681
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,972
One of the ways to do
that, and this doesn't

682
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,807
necessarily mean, you
know, I have to spend

683
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,442
the next two weeks
reversing this binary,

684
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:48,179
but if I get a domain
name, if I get a hash value

685
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,180
or something, pull the sample.

686
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,015
What's it do?

687
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,483
What's it relate to?

688
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,716
Can I enrich this in some sense
instead of just passing on,

689
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,552
like hey, this is bad.

690
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,485
It looks like Emotet.

691
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,787
Like okay, cool story, Bro.

692
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,856
It's like no, here's
a domain name,

693
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,058
and by the way, the
registration information on this

694
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,227
matches the same
tendencies that we've seen

695
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,062
in 28 for the last
three years or whatever.

696
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,930
They don't do that any more
because that got burned

697
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,233
publicly, but that
was a valid way

698
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,135
of identifying newly
registered infrastructure

699
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,437
that you couldn't be
fully confident that,

700
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,039
I know this is
related to Fancy Bear,

701
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,374
but I have some information
that makes that more useful,

702
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,376
and I can proactively
respond to it,

703
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,879
so a lotta that links
to understanding

704
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,581
at a behavioral level, and
this is where traditional

705
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,916
intelligence comes into play,
how do these adversaries

706
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,185
operate, and what do I look
for beyond just identifying

707
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,521
those atomic pieces
of information?

708
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,889
From a sharing
group perspective,

709
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,459
we privilege either
sending the TLP Red report

710
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,927
that we're not supposed to share

711
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,129
to all of our buddies,
or sending up an IOC feed

712
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,130
to move things
around between nodes.

713
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,300
That's cool, but we need
to start figuring out a way

714
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,302
to communicate not
just what we see

715
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,137
at that initial data
collection point

716
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,139
and then the after action
review of all that happened

717
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,009
but how to communicate
with our peers

718
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,111
in sharing groups,
other organizations,

719
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,814
friends, goofy Twitter
groups, and whatnot

720
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,215
what sort of
behaviors we're seeing

721
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,385
to inform that I&W
process, and finally,

722
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,886
from a vendor perspective,
which is where I'm

723
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,655
currently sitting
in most of this,

724
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,091
identify a means and
start feeling comfortable

725
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,360
with reporting items before
you get to the whole story.

726
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,863
There needs to be a
certain level of humility,

727
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,933
almost, that in
collecting information,

728
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,868
that we don't need
to wait until we know

729
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,770
the complete answer in
order to provide people

730
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,839
with some sense of
what's going on.

731
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,309
You can do that, but I think
that that disadvantages

732
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,110
defenders in light of what
the attackers are doing

733
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,612
because they're not gonna wait

734
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,814
until they have a complete
sense of what's going on

735
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,316
before delivering
effects on target

736
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,018
or stealing something
and what not.

737
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,319
They're just gonna
fulfill their mission

738
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,754
as they're able to do so.

739
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,789
We need to adapt ourselves
to that life cycle,

740
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,026
and instead of, put
ourselves in a continued,

741
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,328
backward looking format,
try and keep pace

742
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,363
with how attackers are operating
and report that information

743
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,666
in as real near
time as possible,

744
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,467
and maybe that means designing
a different kind of product.

745
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,270
Instead of delivering
things in the five page,

746
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,872
written reports,
come up with, like,

747
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,573
tippers with a standard format

748
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,242
that defines what
we're looking like.

749
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,511
For example, what would
this sort of look like?

750
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,945
And this goes back to what
we sort of talked about

751
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,013
with what intelligence
needs to do.

752
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,915
It needs to be timely.

753
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,149
If I'm getting this a week later

754
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,751
for an event that's
gonna lead to a wiper

755
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,787
within 24 hours of
install, like ha ha.

756
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,855
I better see that before
that wiper starts detonating,

757
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,323
or else I'm gonna be very upset,

758
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,558
but it also needs
to be descriptive.

759
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,326
We don't just want
the raw IOC sharing.

760
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,961
We want context around that,

761
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,999
how this observable data orients
to known attacker behavior,

762
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,568
what we can then theorize
from that behavior

763
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:27,038
in order to tailor response
and subsequent actions,

764
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,108
which is the last
part, intelligence
needs to be actionable.

765
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,676
Just saying like,
oop, here's a hash.

766
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,711
This malware's bad.

767
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,812
Our product blocks this.

768
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,312
That sucks.

769
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,982
When I was on the other side
of actually taking in reports

770
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,118
and whatnot, that
always just stunk

771
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,053
trying to read because
that doesn't really tell me

772
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,121
a whole lot to do.

773
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,522
Instead, actionable in the sense

774
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,091
of here's what the
indicator means.

775
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,892
Here's what the observed
behavior indicates,

776
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,361
and by the way, here're
different things

777
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,629
that you can do to
either look for it,

778
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,430
identify it, maybe
even kick it out,

779
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,066
and these don't need to
be necessarily written

00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,140

783
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,043

00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,244

00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,379
