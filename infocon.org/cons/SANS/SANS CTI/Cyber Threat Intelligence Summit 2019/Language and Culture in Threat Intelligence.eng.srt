1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,435
(calm music)

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,274
(logo bangs)

3
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,612
(audience claps)

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,116
- Thank you guys for comin' out.

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,485
Like she said, my name is
Mitchell, or Mitch Edwards.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,421
You might also know me
as VikingSec on Twitter,

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,424
or the homeless kid that they
keep letting into the hotel.

8
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,526
If you've seen me recently.

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,229
I'm a virtual operation
specialist with the CrowdStrike.

10
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,930
I also do DevOps work
as of a week ago,

11
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,701
and I'm also an O.G
fuzzy snuggly dog.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,970
We have a pretty good
showing here, so.

13
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,308
I got my BA in Computer Science,

14
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,678
BA in Mandarin Chinese from
the University of Mississippi.

15
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:49,715
And yes we do wear shoes,
that's commonly mistaken.

16
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,086
I spent three months

17
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,222
of intensive language
study in Shanghai.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,725
When I say intensive
language study,

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,661
I mean we had to sign
a contract stating

20
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,798
that if we spoke any
English during the trip

21
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,267
we were immediately
kicked out of the country,

22
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,768
which is a great way to learn,

23
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,704
because you've got that
constant pressure on you.

24
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,574
I did most of my senior
research in Chinese hacktivism

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:20,080
and social media censorship,
which lead to my senior thesis

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,948
in hacking the Great Firewall.

27
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:25,318
Hacking the Great Firewall was
an automatic scraping program

28
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,586
that detected censorship

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,322
on a popular Chinese
social media site.

30
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,594
Now I am a CrowdStrike
Virtual Operations Specialist,

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,964
which his a really fancy
term for a collections guy.

32
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,302
I do all of my work in
Chinese foreign language.

33
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,372
Data collection, which
is similar to human,

34
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,374
but I'm sitting behind
a computer nice and safe

35
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,009
and drinking my
coffee in my PJs.

36
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,580
I now do DevOps,
which was an easy way

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,949
to kind of move me over
to the automation side.

38
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,619
So I handled the
targeting, the collection

39
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,888
and the automation of
the targeting collection

40
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,458
of Chinese foreign
language data resources.

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,361
My trigger words are
dark and deep web

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,397
because I work
with it constantly.

43
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,666
And blockchain
because that should

44
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,935
be everybody's trigger
word at this point.

45
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,438
So here's a slide explaining
some misconceptions

46
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,206
about the job that I do.

47
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,542
I'm not 007, I
don't sow any chaos

48
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,545
as much as I would love to.

49
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,446
It's not sexy hacker stuff,

50
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,517
it's a whole lot of banging
your head on the keyboard,

51
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,019
and I very rarely look
as well-put together,

52
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,423
and I guess calm, as the guy
in the bottom left picture.

53
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,594
So we're gonna talk about
language and culture today.

54
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,662
It's not very well understood

55
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:48,668
within the kind of career path

56
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,271
that we have with
threat intelligence.

57
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,006
But it's probably
one of the most,

58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,776
if not the most
important discipline

59
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,812
to have within this
career field if you want

60
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:04,217
to move from
reactive to proactive
intelligence gathering.

61
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,085
So for me, I have to have

62
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,988
an in-depth understanding
of Chinese culture.

63
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,392
In order to interact
with sources, in
order to gather data,

64
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,761
I have to understand their
culture, their history

65
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,096
the way people work
in different regions.

66
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:20,466
And Websters has a
pretty good explanation

67
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,802
of what culture means,
but in this scope,

68
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,837
we're talking about
the rules that outline

69
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,941
how we interact with people,
both inside our own culture

70
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,810
and inside other cultures
outside of our own.

71
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,179
Language, I defined it
a little bit easier.

72
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,847
It's just the way
that we interact

73
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,316
with people, the trade means.

74
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,287
Culture is a set of rules
that defines how we interact

75
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,890
with people within our
own culture and outside

76
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,926
of our own culture,
where as language

77
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,928
is the actual medium that
we use in order to do that.

78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,333
And I think I talk
about it here.

79
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,437
So intelligence, it starts,
I didn't put the slide in,

80
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,505
I kinda wanted to just,
the intelligence cycle,

81
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,941
I figured I was talking to a
crowd that knew it well enough,

82
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:05,378
where intelligence has to
start with data collection.

83
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,179
You have to have some
kind of source of data,

84
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,182
and that data comes
in different forms.

85
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,552
With technical intelligence,

86
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,255
there's different forms, or ya
know, they're numerous ones,

87
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,625
but for me, that comes in the
form of different languages.

88
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,729
All of mine foreign
language research

89
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,399
has been through the medium
of the Chinese language,

90
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,935
so it's incredibly
important to understand

91
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,638
the format of the data
that you're gathering.

92
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,341
Cultural, ethnic
and regional nuances

93
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,709
are incredibly important

94
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,212
in just about every
language, especially Chinese.

95
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,714
If you don't quite
understand the language,

96
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,883
you're going to not just run

97
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,519
into pitfalls collecting the
data, but you're also going

98
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,421
to get some very
wrong conclusions

99
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,123
from the data that
you do collect.

100
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,492
A good example

101
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,561
of this is the 1970's
interview between Edgar Snow

102
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,897
and Mao Zedong.

103
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,167
In this interview,
Mao uttered a phrase

104
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,036
that basically said
that he was like

105
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,872
the lonely monk underneath
a leaky umbrella.

106
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,641
He has no hair,
and there's no sky.

107
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,844
Well that sounds, and it
sounded to Edgar Snow,

108
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,347
like he was basically trying
to downplay his abilities.

109
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,015
He was trying to
appear as somebody

110
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,017
who's on or below his level,

111
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,752
and trying to appear
nonthreatening.

112
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,289
That's how he reported
it to the U.S.

113
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,791
Well it turns out that,

114
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,161
that was a very common
cultural phrase in Chinese,

115
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,897
where the last part, where
he says I've no hair,

116
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,433
and there's no sky,
also translates

117
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,069
to I follow no law
and I have no God.

118
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,938
So if you translate
it the correct way,

119
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,174
and it's translated,
or it sounds

120
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,209
the exact same,
it's a homophone.

121
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,478
So if you translate
it the correct way,

122
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,913
he was actually being
very threatening,

123
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,181
and he was trying to tell him

124
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,717
that I don't follow the
normal diplomatic laws.

125
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,019
I don't follow the
norm, you know,

126
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,021
the norms that've
been set by the U.S.

127
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,991
So that was a way
that Mao was both able

128
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:03,930
to mock U.S and also
inform his domestic readers

129
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,599
of his intentions
diplomatically.

130
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,634
And it's also a
very great example

131
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,071
of why you need to
have this deep language

132
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,473
and culture understanding,

133
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,042
in order to interact
with one's sources.

134
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,145
So interacting
with sources relies

135
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,615
on a deep cultural
and lingual knowledge.

136
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,816
If you don't have knowledge

137
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,417
of the culture,
especially in Chinese,

138
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,786
you're really going
to be missing out,

139
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,987
and you can actually put

140
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,856
yourself in some pretty
dangerous situations

141
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,025
if you're creating
cover in order

142
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,659
to create personas on forums,

143
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,864
which is a lot of what I
do on a day-to-day basis.

144
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,097
If you're creating a cover

145
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,300
and you say that
you're from Shanghai,

146
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,103
and you talk with
a Beijing accent,

147
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,807
it's not going to go well,
especially or vice versa.

148
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,076
So having that deep
cultural knowledge,

149
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,446
that understanding of the
different regional dialects,

150
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,282
and that understanding of each
region's culture and history

151
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,317
is incredible important
in collections.

152
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,288
So we're gonna move into some
particular unique difficulties

153
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,157
in Chinese collection.

154
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,494
If you've read anything
about the beginnings

155
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,662
of Chinese hacker culture,

156
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,296
you know that it
started very similarly

157
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,332
to how it did in the West.

158
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,469
It was wide open, it was
occasionally invite only,

159
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,871
but you could pretty
much get access

160
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,673
to most forms pretty easily.

161
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,975
You just had to be
able to find them.

162
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,677
The memberships were open,

163
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,779
and the attacks were
easy to attribute

164
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,049
because most of the time they
ripped off Western tools.

165
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,152
They all stuck to
the same kind of TTP,

166
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,253
as they all used the
same architecture.

167
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,722
It was very easy
in the beginning.

168
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,924
When I say the beginning

169
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,359
I mean like late
90's, early 2000's.

170
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,094
It's very difficult now.

171
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,064
They've massively
changed the way they run

172
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,301
the Chinese underground
in these forums,

173
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:53,039
in that the high-value forums
have either disappeared

174
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,308
or they're very difficult
to get access to.

175
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,808
Now the reason why that matters,

176
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,846
is because if you're
not able to get access

177
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,747
to these forums as
easily as you did before,

178
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,484
you lose a lot of that
data collection ability.

179
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,685
You don't have the same sources

180
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,886
that you did back in the day,

181
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,621
and that also is kind of a sign

182
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,991
that they've imported their
operational service as well.

183
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,592
Once thing that I'll
talk about a good bit,

184
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,094
is that they've moved away

185
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:19,065
from what we kind of know as
the Eastern European standard

186
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,469
of the underground, and that
now they're all in QQ groups,

187
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,871
which his very decentralized.

188
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,840
It's much more
difficult to get access

189
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,042
to a couple dozen
different QQ groups

190
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,911
as it is an invite-only
Russian forum,

191
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,880
where all of the
data's in one place.

192
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:36,848
And that's that decentralization

193
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,184
that I was just talking about.

194
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,751
The decentralization means

195
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:43,188
that there are completely
dispersate groups

196
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,592
all in different, you
know, we chat in QQ groups,

197
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,160
that all have different aims.

198
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,228
They all have different motives.

199
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,662
They all use different tools.

200
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,999
So it can be incredibly
difficult to get access

201
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,868
to a lot of these groups,
because A you have to find them,

202
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,303
and B once you do find them,

203
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,873
there are some certain stringent
requirements for entering.

204
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,241
A lot of time they
won't let you in,

205
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,310
if you got a foreign
phone number.

206
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,646
A lot of times you
have to maintain

207
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,914
a certain level of activity

208
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,382
in these groups in
order to stay in,

209
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,651
which means that you have
to know the language.

210
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,984
It can be incredibly difficult

211
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,288
as compared to the
wide-open forums

212
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,756
that we saw in the beginning.

213
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,926
And then the
domestic hacking laws

214
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,430
have made it a lot more
difficult to get information.

215
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,632
They don't talk about
things as widely

216
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,467
as hackers do in the West,

217
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,337
because they assume that
the Chinese government

218
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,539
is watching everything
they do, because duh.

219
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,410
So now their operational
security has improved

220
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,911
to the point where, in the West,

221
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,080
you see people literally
bragging about federal crimes,

222
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,349
and it's very difficult

223
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,151
to get relatively
menial information

224
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,519
out of some of these people.

225
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,654
Now there is the
occasional exception,

226
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:52,224
but it's not nearly as
popular as you see now,

227
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,393
where people will just
spin up a Twitter profile,

228
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,996
and brag about what they
did the night before.

229
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,999
Self-censorship
is a huge problem.

230
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,370
Its gotten to the point where
they don't even bother waiting

231
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,539
for their messages to be
removed from these forums.

232
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,108
They just go ahead and
they don't talk about

233
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,143
the different political
tensions and things like that,

234
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,114
but often drives on
the attacks that we see

235
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,217
from Chinese e-crime
particularly.

236
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,519
So self-censorship
kind of cuts off

237
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,521
your collections capability
from the beginning

238
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,055
without it ever
having to be removed

239
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,359
by site administrators
or something like that.

240
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,463
And then we've got the
isolationist policies

241
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,998
of the last couple
of years, especially.

242
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,103
The Pwn2Own incident was
essentially last year.

243
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,972
China completely barred
all of the researches

244
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,141
from going to the
Pwn2Own conference

245
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,509
in Vancouver, I believe.

246
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,146
And that was
because, essentially,

247
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,382
the Chinese teams
were always winning,

248
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,251
and they were constantly
basically dumping

249
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,920
some really good
zero-days, and China wanted

250
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,454
to have complete ownership

251
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,125
over all of their talent,
all of their resources.

252
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,094
So they aren't letting
them share nearly as much.

253
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,063
We're seeing that in
other communities as well,

254
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,165
where they basically want to
keep Chinese zero-days Chinese.

255
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,103
The Great Firewall
is a huge problem,

256
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,106
especially for people
on the outside.

257
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,509
It's actually more
difficult to find a VPN

258
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,277
that gets you into China,

259
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,047
than it is to find one
that gets you out of China.

260
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,517
It kinda seems like it would
be the other way around,

261
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,219
but in order to get access
to a lot of these sites,

262
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,921
they will actually lock it down

263
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,223
to where foreigners aren't
able to visit the sites.

264
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,592
The Great Firewall
that we know of,

265
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,093
is a great firewall
that keeps all

266
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,396
of the domestic Chinese citizens

267
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,464
from visiting foreign sites.

268
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,801
Well, they also do
the exact opposite,

269
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,470
in order to maintain
ownership over

270
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,806
their own data, over
their own sites.

271
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,741
Even just normal
social media sites

272
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,711
are often times banned
from foreign views.

273
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,512
These Chinese hacker
groups that I said

274
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,047
were all in their
own WeChat groups,

275
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,751
there is a lot of crossover
between different groups,

276
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,319
but they all tend to
have their own hierarchy.

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,289
And in order to
infiltrate a group,

278
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,091
especially in a foreign language

279
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,127
with a foreign culture, it
can be incredibly difficult

280
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,628
when you're dealing
with a strict hierarchy.

281
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,532
You often times have to
march your way up the chain

282
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,403
in order to get access to the
high-value targets in a group.

283
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,739
So it can be difficult
to both understand

284
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,974
the country's culture,
the country's language,

285
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,810
but also each individual
group's culture and language.

286
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,746
So you have this
kind of tier process,

287
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,415
where you've got a cultural
and lingual understanding

288
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,218
of the country, a cultural
lingual understanding

289
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,154
of the region and a cultural
and lingual understanding

290
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,723
of the group, or
forum, that you're in.

291
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,391
Like I said, they
often congregate

292
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,627
and invite only WeChat
groups, which is difficult

293
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,897
because you have to find
the particular group itself,

294
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,700
you have to get an
invite from somebody,

295
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,236
and you have to maintain a
certain level of activity,

296
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,371
which is pretty
starkly contrasted

297
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,305
to the Eastern European
and the Western forum

298
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,909
that we know of very fondly now.

299
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,878
So the central hacking tools,

300
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,913
if you can get
access to the forums,

301
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,149
are actually a problem
in and of themselves.

302
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,052
A lot of times they're all
the exact same tools bundled

303
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,355
up into different kits.

304
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,924
Some kits are being
sold at the same time

305
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,526
as being offered for
free on the same forums,

306
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,128
and you never really know
what you're going to get.

307
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,998
These kits are just full
of just random scripts,

308
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,501
and executable, and you don't
really know what they all do,

309
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,005
and all of those kits are
being sold on different forums.

310
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,540
So the problem with that, is
it makes it very difficult

311
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,042
to attribute a
lot of these tools

312
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,878
because they're sharing
them relatively frequently

313
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,680
on a lot of different forums.

314
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,714
And you'll get groups that
have different motives,

315
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:40,319
that'd have different
procedures and techniques

316
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,122
to use those tools, and
it could be very difficult

317
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,757
to actually attribute what
you're actually looking at,

318
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,127
what kind of, which group

319
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,862
is actually carrying
out an attack?

320
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
And there are also
multiple versions,

321
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
so you'll get minor
tweaks of these programs

322
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,002
that are being
completely repackaged

323
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,772
and sold into different kits
on different forums as well.

324
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,543
So looking forward, it
can be very difficult

325
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,580
to get bogged down in
technical intelligence.

326
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,982
I think it's obviously
incredibly valuable,

327
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,183
because at the end of the day,

328
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,052
if you're blocking a
threat at the endpoint,

329
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,787
or if you're blocking
it at the firewall,

330
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,990
it can be incredibly,
that's an attack stop.

331
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,759
What I like to focus on,

332
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,896
is moving from
reactive to proactive.

333
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,665
Intelligence should be
focused on that in particular,

334
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,503
because if you can get
access to these forums,

335
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,506
and you can get access to
the attackers themselves,

336
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,443
and get access to their tools,
get access to their motives,

337
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,944
their way of thinking, and
talk to them about attacks

338
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,947
that haven't happened yet,
that's a lot more valuable

339
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:46,218
than actually blocking it
at the endpoint hopefully.

340
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,353
You can really screw
up if you're focusing

341
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,623
on reactive intelligence,
because you're never going

342
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,825
to get it 100% right.

343
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,326
If you're proactive about it,

344
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,096
if you're actually reaching
out in these environments,

345
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,832
you can stop the attack
before it ever happens.

346
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,335
But it does require that
cultural and lingo expertise.

347
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,605
It does require having
analysts and collectors

348
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,073
in these different environments,

349
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,175
and that can be incredibly
difficult and time consuming.

350
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,779
Interacting with the
sources that have access

351
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,314
to the tools, tactics,
techniques and procedures

352
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,584
before they're ever
used on a target network

353
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,486
is the best way to be proactive.

354
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,222
We're talking about before
the attack ever happens,

355
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,723
the leftest of boom that
you could possibly get,

356
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:29,061
is what we're aiming for with
foreign language collection.

357
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,930
A lot of times it doesn't
work out that way,

358
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,232
but if you focus on this lingual

359
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,601
and cultural expertise,
gaining access

360
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,604
to these forums, gaining access
to the high-value targets,

361
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,872
that can be incredibly valuable

362
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,675
before you ever see
the attack take place.

363
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,477
There are also plenty
of certifications

364
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,713
for technical capabilities.

365
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,948
Obviously we're at SANS.

366
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,549
They've got the best
technical training

367
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,217
that you could possibly ask for,

368
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,019
and that's incredibly valuable,

369
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,956
but we also need cultural
and lingual training as well.

370
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,992
Aside from going and
getting your BA like I did,

371
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,329
which I don't know that I
could even recommend that.

372
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,333
It was hell, but aside
from that and going

373
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:12,338
to federal testing, and
doing I think it's DLI,

374
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,473
there's really not a great way

375
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,407
to gain that cultural
and lingual expertise.

376
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,643
It's very difficult.

377
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,212
We're talking
about a SANS course

378
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,348
that lasted a couple
weeks, versus a BA

379
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,582
that last four years,

380
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,516
versus all of the
different foreign travel

381
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,654
that you've got to do,
which is its own problem.

382
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,189
It can be very difficult,

383
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,458
but it's something that
we should strive for.

384
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,961
A good way to kind
of bridge that gap,

385
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,497
is taking people from
different disciplines.

386
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,031
Some of my best trainers

387
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,634
and resources have
always been journalists,

388
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,036
they've been academics,

389
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,071
they've been just sources,
expats especially,

390
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,507
are great people to talk to,

391
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,909
because they have that
on-the-ground intelligence.

392
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,444
If I talk to 'em about
technical matters,

393
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,179
they have no idea what
they're talking about,

394
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,083
but they can give me that
cultural and lingual expertise,

395
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,785
that background that they have,

396
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,653
in order to help
me bridge the gap

397
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,689
between the technical and
the proactive intelligence

398
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,857
that we're looking for.

399
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,193
Until we've got those
standards though,

400
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,329
until we have this focus
on the company level

401
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,266
and the team level, we need
to promote that hiring.

402
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,669
We need to promote people
to make those collections

403
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,806
with journalists, with
expats, with academics.

404
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,976
And that's gotta happen
from an interpersonal level.

405
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,378
I can give you a pretty
decent curated list

406
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,180
of journalists that
you could talk to,

407
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,250
who each have their
own biases and you have

408
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,452
to approach them all
in different ways.

409
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,187
Same thing for academics.

410
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,357
But doing that on the
interpersonal level

411
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,459
is probably the best
way for us to bridge

412
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,594
that gap before we
get this cultural

413
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,530
and lingual, I guess standards,

414
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,299
set out for our individual
teams and companies.

415
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,802
As vendors, we need to hire

416
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,570
and equip these
cultural linguists.

417
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,206
After we've hired them,
we need to give them

418
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,974
the resources that they need

419
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,511
in order to fulfill
their position.

420
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,613
So they need that,
if they're coming

421
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,815
from a different discipline,

422
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,483
we need to give them
that technical training.

423
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,751
That needs to be
from the ground up,

424
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,453
because a lot of times
these people didn't take

425
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,754
the basic CS courses.

426
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,090
You can't expect somebody

427
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,957
who has done all of
their academic work

428
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,394
in a liberal arts area to have

429
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,663
a great technical
background as well,

430
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,698
but you also can't bar
them from a community

431
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,435
where they can do the best
work they could possibly do.

432
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,171
So we need to equip them
with the tools and training

433
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:30,976
they need to collect, and we
need to actually create teams

434
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,679
that are devoted to this
foreign language access.

435
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,448
This can't be a side job
that takes a lot of work

436
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,184
to establish these
personas, establish access

437
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,619
to a lot of these forums

438
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,455
and a lot of these QQ groups,
especially for Chinese.

439
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,357
It can be very difficult
and time consuming,

440
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,793
which is why you need a
team that's in itself,

441
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,228
in order to do this foreign
language collections.

442
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,999
As consumers, we need to
know what questions to ask.

443
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,400
That can be
incredibly difficult,

444
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,803
because coming from
the collections side,

445
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,671
and talking to a
lot of the analysts,

446
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,373
the questions that
we typically get

447
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,941
are either misinformed,

448
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,578
or our hey, what is
China doing right now?

449
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,580
It's very difficult to
answer the question of,

450
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,515
what is China doing right now?

451
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,452
Another answer, or
another question,

452
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,254
off the top of my
head I think was,

453
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,792
give us a detailed history
of the Chinese e-crime scene.

454
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,128
Okay, I can ya a book on that,

455
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,264
but it's going to
take us a while.

456
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,965
So we need to know
what questions to ask,

457
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,168
we need to establish a
really healthy relationship

458
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,169
between these cultural
and lingual experts

459
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,473
with our vendors, and
the in-house analysts

460
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,644
that we've got as well, because
that growing communication

461
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,548
and relationship is going to
train you at the same time.

462
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,882
If you know what
questions to ask,

463
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,250
you're going to be
able to teach yourself

464
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,186
about what the
problem is as well.

465
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,855
So these are a
couple of questions

466
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,391
just off the top of my head
that you could ask vendors.

467
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,194
The first one is
incredibly specific,

468
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,162
but I think it's probably
the most pertinent,

469
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,031
especially right now.

470
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,532
A lot of companies, especially

471
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,966
the larger international ones,

472
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,204
have a lot of ties in
Hong Kong and Taiwan.

473
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,240
We've seen it with a lot
of the airliners recently

474
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,309
who got in to some
pretty hot water

475
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,312
for listing Taiwan and Hong
Kong as different countries,

476
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,880
from separate
countries from China.

477
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,951
So you need to look at
the specifics there.

478
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,420
That in itself is a
very easy yes or no,

479
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,024
or small detailed question
that you can ask your analyst,

480
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,160
and that they can return back
to you relatively quickly.

481
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,163
You've got a pretty
easy return on that.

482
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,600
Are there any
opportunities for training?

483
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,270
And I listed
specifically training

484
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,606
for analysts, sales
and management.

485
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,507
This needs to be bottom to top.

486
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,676
It's incredibly
important to have

487
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,213
that expertise on
the analysts level,

488
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,716
but having sales
people and managers

489
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,083
who also have that cultural

490
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,686
and lingual expertise
is incredibly important.

491
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,188
These people who can
navigate the cultural waters,

492
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,690
especially related to China

493
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,859
and a lot of the other Middle
Eastern countries as well,

494
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:05,097
it can be very difficult
to approach their position

495
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,966
without a deep understanding
of the culture.

496
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,968
And you can also create some
pretty embarrassing gaffes

497
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,205
if you don't know
the culture as well.

498
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,606
People who walk
into a board room

499
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,109
and just say
incredibly offensive

500
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,145
or in-cultural things can
really create some issues

501
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,047
for your company as well.

502
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,649
And you need to
ask, does the vendor

503
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,316
that I currently use have

504
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:29,421
that cultural lingual expertise,
and can they help train?

505
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,590
Just simple questions like,

506
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,493
it doesn't to necessarily
need to be in the form

507
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,428
of an RFI or anything
formal like that,

508
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,030
but just send them
a message and say,

509
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,264
hey, what do I need to know

510
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,467
to better navigate
these waters right now?

511
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,902
Because it's
incredibly difficult

512
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,637
and they're going
to want to help you.

513
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,641
So I mentioned earlier
that we don't like the hey,

514
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,843
what is happening
in China question.

515
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,479
If you can shape it a little
bit more specifically,

516
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,549
like hey, I just read
this story on a CMP,

517
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,984
what do I need to know about it?

518
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,687
Hey, this new policy
was just launched

519
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,889
in China, how does it affect me?

520
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:08,060
Just ask very general,
what-is-going-on questions,

521
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,062
and start at the
strategic level,

522
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,729
start at the cultural level,

523
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,565
because that's going
to end up finding

524
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,834
its way down to
the tactical level.

525
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,269
If we look at the development

526
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,237
of the Chinese
economy especially,

527
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,239
you could in
hindsight especially,

528
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,110
guess the areas where China
was going to focus on IP theft,

529
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,712
based on where they were trying

530
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,581
to develop their RND reforms
and their RND policy.

531
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,452
If we had looked at
that five years earlier,

532
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,021
we probably could've hardened
lot of their future targets

533
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,956
a lot sooner if we had looked

534
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,658
at it from a strategic
level instead

535
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,259
of just the tactical level.

536
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,197
So I talked about training,

537
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,032
I think that's
incredibly important.

538
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,602
I don't think we should be
sending all of our analysts

539
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:55,273
to four year BA programs for
Arabic, Russian and Chinese,

540
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:59,378
but we need to get
better at focusing

541
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:04,282
on interdisciplinary
training, as well as learning

542
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,686
how to explain a lot of the
cultural and lingual nuances

543
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,088
to other people who
haven't had that training.

544
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,393
The communications aspect
of it helps create kind

545
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,828
of an exponential learning curve

546
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,297
that helps everybody
else learn together.

547
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,266
If we're able to explain
the different things

548
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,602
that we've learned, the
different cultural nuances

549
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,670
and lingual nuances,
that can help people

550
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,240
that you're reaching
out to afterwards.

551
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,443
We need a strategic focus
on threat intelligence.

552
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,446
The tactical is really
hot, I understand it.

553
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,215
It looks really nice
to say that we blocked

554
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,185
this many threats
on this product,

555
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,854
but we need to focus on
the strategic as well.

556
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,690
We need to focus on proactive
strategic threat intelligence,

557
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,559
which sounds way too
buzz wordy for something

558
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,226
that I'm saying up on stage.

559
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,897
But if we have this
kind of cultural

560
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,434
and lingual understanding,
that is a great step

561
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,701
in becoming more proactive

562
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,504
in our collections
and analysis efforts.

563
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,010
And finally, I understand
that I just told everybody

564
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,878
that they need to
get Chinese language

565
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,514
and culture experts,
and that's not easy.

566
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,216
There are very few
of them out there,

567
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,284
and it's very difficult
to retain them

568
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,121
and to create actionable
intelligence based

569
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,490
on this cultural and
lingual understanding.

570
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,126
It's not easy and I
completely understand that,

571
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,428
but I think if we
start the focus now,

572
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,930
we're going to
regret it a lot less

573
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,164
in a couple of years

574
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,799
when we didn't have
that strategic focus,

575
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,202
when we didn't have that
proactive intelligence.

576
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,872
It takes a lot of time
to maintain personas,

577
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,142
and to create and establish
access to these groups.

578
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,977
And the sooner you start,

579
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,146
the easier it's going to
be for you in the future.

580
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,549
It becomes a lot more actionable
that the sooner you start,

581
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:49,054
and if you start focusing
your hiring processes

582
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,655
on interdisciplinary analysts,

583
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,892
and on interdisciplinary
researchers especially,

584
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,395
you're going to find that
once you reach that curve,

585
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,129
when you start becoming
more actionable,

586
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,699
you're really going to gather

587
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,035
some really unique and
useful intelligence.

588
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,003
Thank you guys.

589
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,772
(audience claps)

590
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,377
(calm music)
