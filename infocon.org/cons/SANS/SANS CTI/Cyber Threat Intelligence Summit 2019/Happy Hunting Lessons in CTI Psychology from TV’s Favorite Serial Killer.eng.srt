1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,836
(serene music)

2
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,946
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,517
- If you've seen
the TV show Dexter,

4
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,286
you'll probably really
enjoy this presentation.

5
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,792
I'm going to argue that Dexter
is a lot like a CTI analyst.

6
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,762
Now hear me out,
don't judge yet.

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:33,767
Dexter is driven to catch
and stop bad guys, okay.

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,836
He's a bad ass, hiding
behind a geek facade,

9
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,706
like most of us, okay.

10
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,542
And he's a bit socially awkward.

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,278
So this is one of my
favorite scenes from Dexter,

12
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,515
where he is at his
high school reunion,

13
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:53,286
and he is like awkwardly
like what is Hammertime,

14
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,255
I don't really
understand the difference

15
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,524
between Hammertime
and real time.

16
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,193
And it just reminded
me of, you know,

17
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,463
some really fun times
at DEFCON parties,

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,932
I don't know if you guys
have been to any of those,

19
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,869
but you see a lot of the,
you know, awkward dancing,

20
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,204
which I find endearing,

21
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,672
because my skills
are not much better.

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,445
So my name is Charity
Wright, I'm a CTI analyst.

23
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,847
My career started in 2005,

24
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,583
when I joined the
United States Army.

25
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,385
Do I have any Army
people in the house?

26
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,754
Cool, okay, great.

27
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,623
And I'm still serving in the
Texas Army National Guard,

28
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,425
as a Chinese linguist.

29
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,996
So in 2015, I kinda pivoted
over to cyber threat intel,

30
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,833
and now I'm, you know,
obsessed with it, I love it.

31
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,868
So it's a passion of mine.

32
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:46,439
I'm also a mother, a Dallas
Cowboy's fan, I'm from Dallas.

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,907
So you can pity me
right now, thank you.

34
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,679
And I'm a dog, I have four
dogs, and I love them to death.

35
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,716
There's a picture
of me in uniform.

36
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,285
So, like I said I was
a Chinese linguist,

37
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,889
during my active duty
days, I worked at NSA,

38
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,592
which was one of the
most fulfilling missions

39
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,594
I've done so far.

40
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,263
And I'm especially
intrigued with psychology.

41
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,135
Abnormal psychology, which is
why I love shows like Dexter,

42
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,138
and SVU, and so that's
what kind of led me

43
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,474
into the subject we're
gonna address today.

44
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,810
Is the psychology of CTI.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,245
What's going on in our heads

46
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,914
when we're analyzing
intelligence.

47
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,715
So some of our
objectives include

48
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,785
understanding our own
thought processes,

49
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,321
our bias, and how our behavior

50
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,057
affects our threat
intelligence products.

51
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,262
We're gonna learn how to
implement some new behaviors

52
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,130
that will improve our
critical thinking,

53
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,466
and then in turn, improve
our intel products.

54
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,735
And then at the end,

55
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,171
we'll have some little
take home exercises

56
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,072
that you can use in
your office, at work,

57
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,575
or just on your own,

58
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,444
to really challenge each other's
bias and thought processes.

59
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,183
Now before I start,
I have to say this.

60
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,585
You know there's always one
person that ruins the fun.

61
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,355
We are going to be talking
about what would Dexter do.

62
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,256
But I don't mean that literally.

63
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,360
So, don't be like
Dexter and kill people,

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,728
even if they're bad guys.

65
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,799
And I have to disclose also

66
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,170
that none of this presentation
is related directly to

67
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,540
or associated to Showtime
or the show Dexter.

68
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,045
So let's talk a little
bit about metacognition.

69
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,780
It's our inner monologue.

70
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,217
Now if you watch Dexter, you
know he's always in his head.

71
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,587
And lucky for us, we get to
jump in his head with him.

72
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,055
So we get to know what
he's thinking about,

73
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,359
whether it's work, as a
blood spatter analyst,

74
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,063
or about his family,
social awkward situations,

75
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,097
where he just doesn't
know how to behave.

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,001
I'm gonna argue that inner
monologues like Dexter has

77
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,804
are actually good for all of us.

78
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,607
And we're all thinking in
our heads, all the time.

79
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,410
But how often are we actually
thinking about our thinking?

80
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,847
So that's the definition
of metacognition.

81
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,716
Is thinking about your thinking.

82
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:14,187
Now the prefix meta denotes
something of a higher order.

83
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,957
And then the term cognition,
or cognitive thinking,

84
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,628
refers to the use of mental
activities and skills

85
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,163
to perform tasks,
such as learning,

86
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,566
reasoning and understanding.

87
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,101
So you put them together,

88
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,471
and you're really analyzing
about how you're analyzing.

89
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,608
Now, science has discovered
there's a direct correlation

90
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:40,613
between metacognitive awareness
and cognitive performance.

91
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,784
So the more that we're thinking
about our thought processes,

92
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,721
and analysis, the better
our performance will be.

93
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,024
There's also science and
medicine that can prove

94
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,427
that this type of metacognition
can prevent diseases

95
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,030
like Alzheimers,
and loss of memory.

96
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,634
Now, I'm gonna say that
I believe metacognition

97
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,105
is vital to us as
intelligence analysts.

98
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,740
If there's anybody in the world

99
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,843
that should be using
metacognition everyday,

100
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,246
it is us that are
analyzing information.

101
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,918
So let's dig into a
little bit of psychology

102
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,753
of intelligence analysis,

103
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,423
and I wanna refer you to
this book by Richard Heuer,

104
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,957
I think it is the standard,

105
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,993
most of you have
read it or seen it,

106
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,228
if you've been in the
intelligence community.

107
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,265
And I just find it
fascinating to dig into

108
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,034
the psychology
behind what we do.

109
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:39,872
Now, there are many factors
that go into the psychology

110
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,307
of what we do.

111
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,877
We have to take into
consideration perception,

112
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:49,882
reality, intuition and
analytical judgment.

113
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,486
Perception is a way of regarding
or understanding something.

114
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,458
And as you know, we all see
things through a certain lens.

115
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,361
And that really depends on
how you were socialized.

116
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,563
How you grew up,
how you were raised,

117
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,063
what country you're from,

118
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,968
and what culture dictated
how you think about things.

119
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,738
So being aware of your
perception of things,

120
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,773
and what lens you're
looking through,

121
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,009
is very important when you're
analyzing intelligence.

122
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,511
Well then there's reality.

123
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:23,082
And that is the tangible
actual explanation for things.

124
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,984
So that is the reality.

125
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:29,989
Intuition is more
of a intangible,
biological explanation.

126
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,460
Sometimes it's something we
can't even really explain.

127
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,263
And I think that
in the CTI field,

128
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,332
that's often where people
think that CTI is an art,

129
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,069
and I've been one to
argue that in the past,

130
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,004
verses a science,
because a lot of times,

131
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,840
we have intuition,
we have a feeling

132
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,842
that leads us towards
solving a problem.

133
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:54,781
But there's actually some
explanation for intuition.

134
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:59,752
Now, many different fields
attempt to explain intuition.

135
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:05,725
Science might say that it's
an evolutionary process,

136
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,261
that helps us to
adapt and survive.

137
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,065
Spirituality, or
religion might explain it

138
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,802
as a higher power
that is giving you

139
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:19,038
knowledge or information
about your environment.

140
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,808
Either way, many analysts feel

141
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,344
that their intuition
leads them to answers,

142
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,480
or solving puzzles.

143
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,916
But we have to
check out intuition,

144
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,253
and keep it
accountable to reality.

145
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,489
Now all these factors have
to be taken into account

146
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,957
when we're analyzing
intelligence.

147
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,094
And I think that the book
Psychology of Intel Analysis

148
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,397
is a great resources for
really digging into strategies

149
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,899
for analytical judgment.

150
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,904
So this is a really fun
and interesting subject.

151
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,439
Cognitive bias.

152
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,275
Now I'm sure a lot of you
have heard of cognitive bias,

153
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,943
or explored it a little bit.

154
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,445
I'm not gonna go too in depth,

155
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,647
because there actually
is another talk

156
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,417
dedicated just to
cognitive bias.

157
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,818
But I do wanna touch on it,

158
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,919
because it's a very
important part of psychology

159
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,455
and what we do.

160
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,859
Now I wanna start with a riddle,
so everybody pay attention.

161
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,260
I know we're very
smart people in here.

162
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,262
Here is your riddle.

163
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,066
A father and his son
were in an accident.

164
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,569
The father dies at the scene.

165
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,174
The boy, badly injured, is
rushed to a local hospital.

166
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,777
In the hospital, the
operating surgeon

167
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:36,015
looks at the boy and says I
can't operate on this boy,

168
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,149
he's my son.

169
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,488
How can this be, if
the father just died?

170
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,995
Now your intuition
is working, you have,

171
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,596
your brain is thinking through

172
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,199
a certain lens or perspective.

173
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,934
Is anybody wanna
give me an answer?

174
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,869
Any suggestions?

175
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,070
Yes sir.

176
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,038
- [Man In Audience]
It's his mother.

177
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,573
- It is his mother.

178
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,075
(audience laughing)

179
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,012
He might have two dads, yeah.

180
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,948
So interesting,
about this riddle,

181
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:13,452
80% of people immediately
start thinking of alternatives

182
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:17,590
but nobody thinks of
the surgeon is his mom.

183
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,426
And that is because we
sometimes are built in

184
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,428
with bias in our culture,

185
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,264
we don't immediately
jump to the conclusion of

186
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,700
a woman can be a surgeon.

187
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,536
Or the mom is a surgeon.

188
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,339
I know when I heard this
riddle, it was at a conference

189
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,808
about unconscious bias.

190
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,312
And I'm a feminist, I believe
in equality for women,

191
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,416
and here I am thinking of
like every possible scenario

192
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,285
of how it could be his dad.

193
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,088
And it never dawned on me
that it could be his mom.

194
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,824
And when I found out it
was, my mind was blown.

195
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,693
So it just shows
you that sometimes

196
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,329
you are judging a
situation or a picture,

197
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,233
based on your past experience
or based on your culture.

198
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,803
That's something that we all
have to be very careful of.

199
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:08,207
Now bias is defined as the
quick decisions that we make

200
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,510
automatically, and
without awareness.

201
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,945
Now, sometimes people define it

202
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,083
as a logical error in thinking.

203
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,319
Now, did you know
that, oops sorry,

204
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,555
that soft, our brain,
let me go back here,

205
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:28,527
our brain is actually
software that powers,

206
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,030
that contains security
flaws that are unpatched.

207
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,167
So our brains work
much like software,

208
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,770
where they're may be a bug or
something going on in there,

209
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,305
we're not even aware of.

210
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,573
We have to patch that.

211
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,540
None of our brains
work perfectly.

212
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,944
And we're all influenced
by our socialization.

213
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,149
So as CTI analysts, we
have to work to reduce

214
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:55,121
or wholly prevent bias,
prejudice, ulterior motives,

215
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,859
and other internal
psychological factors

216
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,829
from influencing the way that
you're analyzing intelligence.

217
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,930
And coming to conclusions.

218
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,300
So if you think about it,

219
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,834
we're trying to come
up with conclusions,

220
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,338
a lot of people are
jumping to conclusions

221
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,708
about attribution, because
it's like the holy grail

222
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,942
in some organizations.

223
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,211
Everybody wants
to know who it is,

224
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,013
why they're coming after us.

225
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,715
A lot of times we see things

226
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,152
through the perspective
of our background,

227
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,620
and I'll give you an example.

228
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,925
I worked at NSA, obviously a
United States organization.

229
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,361
So I'm seeing things
through the lens

230
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,497
of an American, and who
our adversaries are.

231
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,935
However, now I work
for Ernst & Young,

232
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,804
a global organization.

233
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,706
We have offices
all over the world,

234
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,141
in almost every
country in the world.

235
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,178
And as an internal CTI analyst,

236
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,181
my job is to protect
all of EY employees,

237
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,316
no matter where they live.

238
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,553
So when it comes to
digging in on APTs,

239
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,089
I have to be very
careful and unbiased

240
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,891
not to see things through
the lens of an American,

241
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,527
but to see things through
the lens of globalization.

242
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,599
As a citizen of any
country, and every country.

243
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,736
That being said, I have
had incidents in the past

244
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,572
where on our team,
nobody considered

245
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,976
that the United States could
be attacking another country.

246
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,612
And could be responsible
for an attack.

247
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,115
So we had to address
that bias right up front

248
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,217
and say now wait a second,

249
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,651
if we're writing a report
and we're distributing it

250
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:38,324
to global leaders, how does
that look for us as Americans?

251
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,093
Pretty bias, so we have to
keep ourselves in check.

252
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,198
Bias definitely influences

253
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,634
our products end
result and attribution.

254
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,569
But there are
consequences of it too.

255
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,772
Distributing the wrong
threat intelligence,

256
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,975
like lets say you're
sharing on a platform,

257
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,077
or you're sharing
an open source,

258
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,846
distributing the wrong
attribution or information

259
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,015
is gonna hurt everybody
in the community.

260
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,151
And that's a problem
that we see today,

261
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,919
is people are jumping
to conclusions

262
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,420
because they need fast answers.

263
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,257
So we have to really
double check ourselves

264
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,958
not just for our organization,

265
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,327
but for everybody in
the intel community.

266
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay, so next I wanna say
that Dexter is really good

267
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,935
at knowing his enemy.

268
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,905
So this is a point
that we also need to

269
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,372
what would Dexter do.

270
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,476
Dexter, if you know
him, he is very thorough

271
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,879
at investigating his victims,

272
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,282
the bad guys that he goes after.

273
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:42,154
Dexter finds out who
they are, where they are,

274
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,924
their habits, their
life, their family,

275
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,492
he gets into the nitty
gritty and the details,

276
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,030
and he also tries to find
evidence of their guilt

277
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,299
before he kills them.

278
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,269
So as CTI analysts,
we also have to know

279
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,371
our enemies and adversaries.

280
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,674
And that's not just
trivial yeah I know this

281
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,843
about this APT, and I know
this about this cyber criminal,

282
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,080
or group, but really
get to know your enemy.

283
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,749
And it's kind of a cliche term.

284
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,484
But if we follow
Dexter's example,

285
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,487
we're digging in and we're
really getting to know

286
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,057
their TTPs, their
infrastructure,

287
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,825
why they behave the way they do,

288
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,863
and it's very effective
to implement psychology.

289
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,532
If you think about
it, the adversaries

290
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,337
that we're going after are
not just their infrastructure.

291
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,973
They're not just an IP
address, or a malicious domain.

292
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,408
They are human beings.

293
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,411
So we have to treat
it like human beings,

294
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,948
and find out what motivates
them, what are they going after,

295
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,983
and really get to know
them however we can,

296
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,085
to be effective.

297
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,289
The better we learn about our
adversaries ways and means,

298
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,425
the more accurate
our attribution and
assessments will be.

299
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,429
Even if you're light years
away from attribution

300
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,367
in your CTI team, threat
actors learning their ways

301
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:07,172
is going to, it's a vital
aspect of building your team,

302
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,708
building your CTI team,
and building your products.

303
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,379
Another aspect of
what would Dexter do,

304
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,980
is work within a code.

305
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,618
Dexter has been given
a code by his father,

306
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,222
with the number one rule
being never get caught.

307
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,391
Having a code to work
by keeps you focused.

308
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,762
It keep Dexter focused on
what's most important to him,

309
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,329
and his priorities.

310
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,533
And also dictates who
he's allowed to kill.

311
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,068
It gives him boundaries,

312
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,437
and it keeps his
instincts in check.

313
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,041
Now, interesting,
as CTI analysts,

314
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,110
we must also work within a code,

315
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,646
or framework to be effective.

316
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,915
This is gonna help
us to be objective,

317
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:54,053
and it's also gonna help you
to avoid analysis paralysis.

318
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,188
When you're stuck, and
you're going in the weeds,

319
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,756
and you're just going
down that rabbit hole,

320
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,525
and you don't know
where to stop,

321
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,794
working within a
framework, or a code

322
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,896
will really help
you stay focused.

323
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,034
Some examples of CTI
codes or frameworks.

324
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,937
Most of you are probably
familiar with these.

325
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,274
So we have the Lockheed
Martin Cyber Kill Chain,

326
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,410
we have the Diamond Model
of Intrusion Analysis,

327
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,879
the MITRE ATT&CK Framework,

328
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,384
and we have intelligence
priorities, or requirements.

329
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,853
Now this last one, I
think is really important,

330
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,988
so I wanna, I wanna talk

331
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,758
a little bit more about
intelligence priorities.

332
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,596
I call them priorities, and
that's kind of how I translated

333
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,532
intel requirements from
the military sector

334
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,167
into the private sector.

335
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,204
When I talk to leadership,
a lot of them have no idea

336
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,574
what this means and what
do you need from mE.

337
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,075
So, intel priorities
are defined as

338
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,713
any subject, general
or specific, upon
which there is a need

339
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,982
for the collection
of information,

340
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,785
or the production
of intelligence.

341
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,921
This is also know by some

342
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:07,059
as priority intelligence
requirements, or PIRs.

343
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,860
You'll hear that a lot.

344
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,663
And in the military,
they call it CCIRs,

345
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,134
commanders critical
intelligence requirements.

346
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,069
Or simply, intel priorities.

347
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,773
It's an example of a
professional code or framework.

348
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,776
And we know the priority
assets of your organization,

349
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,712
and what you're
working to protect.

350
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,049
Intelligence priorities
will keep you focused

351
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,117
on what comes first.

352
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,019
Where to spend your money,

353
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,622
where to put your energy
and time for your team,

354
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,024
which we know is something
Dexter struggled with

355
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,527
is his priorities.

356
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,163
He was always getting
into these messes

357
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:49,168
between his private life,
which was killing bad guys,

358
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,004
and his urge to kill people,

359
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,339
and then his job as a
blood spatter analyst,

360
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,742
and then he's jugging
roles of being a father,

361
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,378
and a husband, and a brother.

362
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,714
Sometimes it feels the
same way on our CTI teams,

363
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:06,185
and we're just getting
information from
every which way.

364
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,822
But if you have like a top
five intelligence priorities,

365
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,358
you know where to dedicate
your assets and your time.

366
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,160
And these are some examples

367
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,797
of how you can break out
those intel priorities.

368
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,174
So, before moving on,
I wanna address also

369
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:33,145
that if you don't know
if your organization

370
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,481
has intelligence requirements,

371
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,183
I would suggest that
you ask your leadership,

372
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,186
and if they don't have
anything lined out,

373
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,055
ask if you can have a
meeting or a sit down,

374
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,024
and kind of address to them,

375
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,626
this is what this is,

376
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,894
and this is how
it's going to help

377
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,830
our organization
and our CTI team.

378
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,567
And I found that most leaders
are really open to it,

379
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,736
and are encouraged
to know that okay,

380
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,907
we can prioritize our
CTI tools and people.

381
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,045
On your own, there are
some things that you can do

382
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,581
to act on what
we've learned today.

383
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,851
You can dedicate yourself
to knowing your adversaries.

384
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,521
They are humans.

385
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,822
So really dig in,
use whatever tools

386
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,124
and opportunities you can

387
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,759
to learn about the adversaries

388
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,329
that you're countering everyday.

389
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,698
I suggest taking SANS courses,

390
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,203
learn hacking, get
into deep and dark web,

391
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,373
at least news or
products when you can,

392
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:39,378
within the rules of your
organization, of course.

393
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,649
Another thing you can do
on your own is recognize

394
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,452
and address bias in your
cyber threat intelligence.

395
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,155
So really, reading
over your information

396
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,391
and going is there
anything in here

397
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,193
that I don't know for sure?

398
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,095
Am I making proper
risk assessments,

399
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,598
and is it based
on what I do know,

400
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,700
and then am I
giving a probability

401
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,403
or a likelihood of
what I don't know.

402
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,606
Really, making it very
clear to your customers

403
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,707
what they're getting.

404
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,177
And another thing you
can do on your own

405
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,213
is checking your own motives.

406
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,016
Something that I wanna
bring up is ulterior motive.

407
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,686
Now, we all work
for an organization,

408
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,889
or work for ourselves,
or CTI analysts,

409
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,961
we often are pressured
to produce products,

410
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:33,832
and to please the boss,
or create metrics,

411
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,867
which can be a challenge.

412
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:40,272
So, I challenge you
to really assess

413
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,975
what is motivating me to put
out this product right now,

414
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,377
and is it valuable intelligence.

415
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,548
A lot of times, team
leadership or management

416
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:54,519
can demand that a product comes
out looking a certain way.

417
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,857
Or they demand that no,
it has to be this APT,

418
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,026
and we're gonna talk
about it like this.

419
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,261
I challenge you

420
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,264
to really bring up some
dissent in your teams.

421
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,933
Dissent is a good thing,

422
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,535
and having a
professional argument

423
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,805
over the reality of
things, and bias,

424
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,240
and ulterior motive,

425
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,209
I think it's really important
to address those things

426
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,212
so that your intelligence
products are as
pure as possible.

427
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,515
Something you can do
back at your office

428
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,883
or with your team.

429
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,754
Practice metacognition
with your teams.

430
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,622
Host a lunchtime
discussion group.

431
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,227
I think there's murder mystery
games that you can order

432
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,795
and solve together.

433
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,397
And I think that
you're gonna find

434
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,867
when you're working as a team,
in these type of activities,

435
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,402
that it's really
interesting to see

436
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,203
how everybody
thinks differently.

437
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:51,109
I also suggest to do maybe
a lunch and learn sessions,

438
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,078
where you can teach
your team about bias

439
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,114
and how it might be affecting
your threat intel products.

440
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,818
And just bring up that awareness
of the subject to them.

441
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,522
And like I said, dissent is
good, so encourage feedback

442
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:07,192
from your mentors, from your
leadership, or from your peers.

443
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,796
I know that on the current
team, where I'm working,

444
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,232
we have peer review for every
product that we put out,

445
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,968
and it is extremely challenging,

446
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,372
but it's also very
effective to grow and learn

447
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,773
how to be a better writer,

448
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,108
how to be a better analyst,

449
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,444
and really think
outside the box.

450
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,213
Especially if you work
for a global organization,

451
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,248
where people are from
different areas of the world,

452
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,551
everyone has different
ways of thinking.

453
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,985
And I think that doing
team building exercises

454
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,490
is a great way to kind
of open your mind and see

455
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,627
is there a different way
that we can analyze this.

456
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,529
And another thing you
can do with your team

457
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,767
is to find a code or a
framework that works for you.

458
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:53,739
Now I listed a few of the
commonly used frameworks in CTI,

459
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,341
but that does not stop you
from creating your own,

460
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,310
if none of those work for you.

461
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,980
We have to constantly be
working with our teams

462
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,450
and our organization,
in its uniqueness,

463
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,186
and find okay, here's
our intel priorities,

464
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,989
or we're gonna work in
this kind of process,

465
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,692
because that works
for our organization.

466
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,062
So I challenge you to
bring this up to your team.

467
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,997
Challenge what processes
you're currently using.

468
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,200
List out the risks
and benefits of it,

469
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,670
and explore what
other frameworks you
might be able to use

470
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,107
to better analyze intelligence
in your organization.

471
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,177
Okay, great, thank
you guys so much,

472
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,011
I appreciate your time today.

473
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,181
(audience applauding)

474
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,018
(gentle music)

475
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,631
(dramatic music)
