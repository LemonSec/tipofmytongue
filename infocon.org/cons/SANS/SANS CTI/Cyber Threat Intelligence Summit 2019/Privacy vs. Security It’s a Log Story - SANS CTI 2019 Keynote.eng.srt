1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,936
(calm music)

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,346
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,118
- Thank you all
so much for coming

4
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,052
this morning to hear me talk.

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,557
Thank you so much for
Sans for having me.

6
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,526
And I apologize if my voice
is a little bit raspy,

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,462
I've been at ShmooCon
since Thursday,

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,298
and if any of you have
attended hacker cons,

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,368
it's like your voice just
disappears after a bit.

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,705
So who am I, why am I here?

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,341
Why do you care
what I have to say?

12
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,645
My name is Whitney Merrill,
I am a private attorney.

13
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:50,050
I also do data security
and incidence response.

14
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:55,655
I started my career,
unbeknownst to me,

15
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,124
when I attended DEF CON for
the first time in law school,

16
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,428
and realized this is the
community I wanna be a part of.

17
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:05,230
This is exactly what I
wanted (voice distorting)

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,800
didn't even realize
what I was missing.

19
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,004
So I went to law school at
the University of Illinois

20
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,338
(voice distorting) Champaign,

21
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,074
decided I didn't know
enough about the field

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,977
I wanted to advise
and so I stayed

23
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,579
and got my masters
in computer science

24
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,848
with a focus in
computer security

25
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:26,853
and digital forensics
right after school.

26
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,222
After that went to the
Federal Trade Commission

27
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,589
where I investigated companies

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,059
for bad security and
privacy practices

29
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,128
usually triggered
by a data breach.

30
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,163
And then ultimately
left the government

31
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,633
to go work in-house
at a company.

32
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,204
And there I do everything
from incident response,

33
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,539
data breach notification,
to privacy engineering

34
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,878
and supporting teams to answer
any questions they may have,

35
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,114
lately about the GDPR,

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,517
but one of the things
that is gonna be the theme

37
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,119
in my presentation
today is really

38
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,858
how do you properly
handle logging

39
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,694
with this new realm of GDPR

40
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,496
because I'm sure many
of you have heard,

41
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,198
how many here have
heard of GDPR?

42
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,201
Yeah, I live and breathe it.

43
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,904
I used to wake up
at 3 in the morning

44
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,972
for six months
straight before GDPR

45
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,510
went live just in a panic
that I would forget something.

46
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,012
But, today I'm
gonna kinda take you

47
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,915
on the journey as
the lumberjack.

48
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,783
I joke with some of the teams

49
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,820
that I will slice and dice
what they're collecting,

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,825
but I'll also kind of
work, walk you through

51
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,462
some of the (voice
distorting) situations

52
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:47,466
that make me feel the tensions
between privacy and security.

53
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,503
So lawyers love disclaimers.

54
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,906
I should make it very clear
that I'm not your lawyer,

55
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,175
this isn't legal advice.

56
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,244
If you work at a
company or individually

57
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,547
you should consult
with your lawyer

58
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,182
about how to handle things.

59
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,684
But hopefully this will
give you another perspective

60
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,855
of kind of GDPR, privacy
and security tensions.

61
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,024
I'm also here in my
personal capacity,

62
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,859
so I don't speak
for my employer.

63
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,197
So let me give you
some background.

64
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,266
Generally I'm going to tell
a little bit of a story

65
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,403
about the tensions between
privacy and security.

66
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,940
How many people here
do privacy work?

67
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,577
Okay, three people.

68
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,045
I think that's
really significant

69
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,180
because most of the
people when you say

70
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:38,151
oh I'm a privacy attorney
or oh I do security,

71
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,787
they assume that you
also do the other.

72
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:45,792
And so for me I have found
especially in my current role

73
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,928
that those two things conflict
with each other quite a bit

74
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,863
and how do we work
through kind of

75
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,565
the differences between the two?

76
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,501
So from the privacy standpoint,

77
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,371
it's the right to have control

78
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,106
over the information
that you use.

79
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,942
How is it when we
collect information

80
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,179
do we protect it in a
way that the consumer

81
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,781
or the person you're
collecting it about consents

82
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,618
believes that you're going to do

83
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,920
something right with their data,

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,755
that they are okay with what
you're doing with their data.

85
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,291
And security, generally,
forgive me for watering

86
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,127
this down a bit, is generally
the protection of the data.

87
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,129
What are the standards
you're gonna put around it?

88
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,897
Where are you gonna store it?

89
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,865
How are you gonna store it?

90
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,699
Et cetera.

91
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,870
But security is
necessary for privacy,

92
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,539
but privacy isn't
necessary for security.

93
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,808
And so this is where the
tensions really come about

94
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,344
with privacy and security,

95
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,514
when I talk to a
security professional

96
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,715
and I say to them,

97
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,417
I'm really concerned
about you collecting x.

98
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,388
They're going, well then we
can't detect this threat, right?

99
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,558
And so how do you work through
what you should collect

100
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,495
versus what the
consumer or the business

101
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,898
or GDPR generally
allows you to collect.

102
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,000
And so is it a full on war?

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,502
Somewhat.

104
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,804
And in some cases we're gonna
figure out what that balance

105
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,239
is gonna look like
over the next 10 years

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,977
as litigation comes about
as we really, hopefully

107
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,145
get more technical
people in government

108
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,881
and regulatory
bodies to actually

109
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,282
take a look at what
the right balance is

110
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,486
for these privacy and
security tensions.

111
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,824
And so in this talk I'm
gonna talk primarily about

112
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,327
can we have both and
what does that look like?

113
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,796
I'm gonna try to
strike a balance.

114
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,366
And as Rick said, if
you have feedback,

115
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,202
so this is the first time I've
given this particular talk,

116
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,704
and I think it's
really interesting,

117
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,139
but I am really interested
in hearing your feedback

118
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,676
and your experiences
in log retentions

119
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,647
and what you need and feel
like you need in your capacity.

120
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,852
And the tensions
of can be have both

121
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,686
comes from a legal perspective

122
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,489
that I'm gonna come
back to this slide

123
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,090
a little bit later
in the presentation.

124
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,160
But what is reasonable
security, right?

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,829
That's the balance, ultimately,

126
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,697
of privacy and data security.

127
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,766
So,

128
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,137
there we go.

129
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,272
What's going on in Europe?

130
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,477
Obviously, all of of you,
almost, have heard of the GDPR.

131
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,679
One of the biggest articles
that we really care about

132
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,783
in GDPR, which is the General
Data Protection Regulation,

133
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,017
for those who are not familiar,

134
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,120
but it sounds like
many of you are,

135
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,190
but reasonable security
is incorporated

136
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,826
into the GDPR in
article 32, right?

137
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,996
They're saying that you
have to take into account

138
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,465
the costs of the
implementation, the nature,

139
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,967
the scope, the context,
and the purposes

140
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,737
in which you're processing the
risks of varying likelihood

141
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,907
of severity of the rights and
freedoms of natural persons.

142
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,375
So what does that mean?

143
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,645
And so I'm gonna kind of break
down in this presentation

144
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,948
what that means from a very
specific point of view.

145
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,153
So reasonable security
in the United States

146
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,355
has been around for quite a bit,

147
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,557
and I gave a talk
a long time ago,

148
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,059
or I guess about a
year and a half ago

149
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,596
about what is reasonable
from a legal perspective.

150
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,300
Generally it's almost
the same as this,

151
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,336
except for just kind
of more wishy washy

152
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,006
because lawyers love gray.

153
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,842
And for how many people here
regularly talk to an attorney

154
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,378
or their in-house council?

155
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,948
So descent amount.

156
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,349
How many people have
heard it depends

157
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,019
when you talk to a lawyer?

158
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,554
Right?

159
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,357
It's, the reason being is when
we talk about legal standards

160
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,593
the law loves to
create a standard

161
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,762
that has enough flexibility

162
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,832
that allows technology to
change or the world to change

163
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,099
and then you apply
that to the standard.

164
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,138
So we don't really know
if x is going to cause y

165
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,775
until the court
basically rules on that.

166
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,710
But in giving legal
advice and legal guidance

167
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,013
we take a look at
previous examples

168
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,616
and we say okay, how
can we apply the facts?

169
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,918
How can we advise
on this situation

170
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,554
based on what we know
about that standard?

171
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,655
So reasonable security
in the United States

172
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,359
looks at the
foreseeable risk of harm

173
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,561
of the actions versus the
utility of the actions,

174
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,065
the extent of the risk created,

175
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,101
and the likelihood that that
risk will cause harm to others,

176
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,670
so that's kind of like GDPR,

177
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,806
and any alternatives
of lesser risk

178
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,808
and the cost of
those alternatives.

179
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,745
So again, super wishy
washy, what does it mean?

180
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:40,219
Under the GDPR how many people
here are familiar with PII

181
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,057
or have been freaking
out about PII under GDPR?

182
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,163
GDPR vastly increased the,

183
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,633
or broadened the
definition of PII.

184
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,703
Under the GDPR it
means any information

185
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:02,641
relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person.

186
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,411
And so this can be identified,

187
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,680
and I'm quoting this directly
'cause it's important to know,

188
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,885
directly or indirectly,
in particular by reference

189
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,923
to an identifier such as a
name, an identification number,

190
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,226
location data, an
online identifier,

191
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,329
or one or more factors
specific to the physical,

192
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,964
physiological, genetic, mental,

193
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,402
economic, cultural, or social
identity of that person.

194
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,203
Uh, that's really big.

195
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,738
What does that ultimately mean?

196
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,975
Well, IP addresses, device
IDs, external facing IDs.

197
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,444
And what I mean here
by external facing IDs

198
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,012
is if that user knows
that that identifier

199
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,482
is associated with
them it is now PII,

200
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,751
regardless of what
it is attached to,

201
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,786
that identifier is now PII.

202
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,123
So that makes a
lot of what you do

203
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,893
and a lot of incidence
response, logging, et cetera,

204
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,395
really difficult because

205
00:09:56,395 --> 00:10:01,400
there are loads of IP addresses
everywhere in a company.

206
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,569
But why do we care?

207
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,439
The reason we care what
is PII is under the GDPR

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,443
certain data subject rights
were given to individuals,

209
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,111
specifically the right to access

210
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,946
the data you have about them.

211
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,548
So if you're
collecting IP addresses

212
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,017
that are directly associated
with that individual,

213
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,220
or device IDs, you need to
be able to pull that data

214
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,123
from your systems and provide
that to the individual.

215
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,525
They have a right
to fix that data,

216
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,026
which doesn't
really come up much,

217
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,096
but more as along
the lines of Equifax

218
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,631
and some of these
other companies

219
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:36,636
that are amassing giant
hoards of data about you.

220
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,139
And then you go and look
at your credit report

221
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,842
and you realize they've looped
in the other John Smith,

222
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,211
and that John Smith doesn't
pay his credit cards

223
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,146
and now your credit
score is hurt.

224
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,281
That's generally where this
right of rectification comes in.

225
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,951
But the right to
delete your data.

226
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:56,589
So if that ID or that IP
address is associated with you,

227
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,990
you have a right
to have it deleted.

228
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,926
So how do these tensions work in

229
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,430
with being able to actually
secure your systems,

230
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,266
secure your company,
or do your job,

231
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,969
with the right of the individual

232
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,404
to have their data deleted?

233
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,306
And so thankfully under the GDPR

234
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,242
they kinda thought
about this a bit,

235
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,411
and they said monitoring
or alert purposes.

236
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,381
Well, that's not like
very, very helpful

237
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:26,419
because there are lots of other
reasons why we collect data

238
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,021
that might be useful
to keep beyond

239
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,326
what exactly the person who's

240
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,028
collecting the
data needs it for.

241
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,900
So, I also wanna touch
upon really briefly,

242
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,668
and I'm not gonna
get into it too much,

243
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,038
but there's this new
law in California

244
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,275
called the California
Consumer Privacy Act.

245
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,178
I'm only gonna touch upon it
to let you know that it exists

246
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,880
and that it is going to affect
businesses in California.

247
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,949
It's kind of like GDPR lite.

248
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,385
So a lot of those rights
that I mentioned before

249
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,787
are also going to
be a part of this.

250
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,223
But it's giving the
right for consumers

251
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,294
to have a request a record of
the data collected about them.

252
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,197
It's gonna give the
right of erasure,

253
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,266
so that right to be forgotten
that you may have heard about,

254
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,902
and so some of the companies

255
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,139
that didn't have to deal
with GDPR in the past

256
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,142
are gonna have to start
worrying about it now.

257
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,444
So now I'm gonna get to
the meat of the talk.

258
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,981
What is really,
really happening here?

259
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:30,815
So why logs?

260
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,551
So why do I care?

261
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,221
Logs demonstrate a major tension

262
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,922
between privacy and security.

263
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,658
They're absolutely necessary
for incident response,

264
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,128
to run your company,
to prevent fraud,

265
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,963
but many create privacy issues,

266
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,233
collecting too much
information for too long.

267
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,001
They violate the privacy's

268
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,004
fundamental commitment
to data minimization,

269
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,209
and so as a security and
privacy professional myself,

270
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,780
I really do feel
like I wear two hats.

271
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,749
I'm that person screaming
where are the logs

272
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,185
when an incident happens
because I need to figure out

273
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,887
what the story is to
tell to tell a regulator.

274
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,157
But I'm also that person
working with teams

275
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,691
to say what data
are you collecting?

276
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,193
Where are you collecting it?

277
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,262
Where are you storing it and
should you be keeping it?

278
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,598
So in working through
the past few years

279
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,635
I've kind of figured
out some tips and tricks

280
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,938
to actually finding
a good balance.

281
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,241
And so one of the big questions
you should ask yourself

282
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,709
is why do you log?

283
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,212
What's the purpose for
what you're doing it?

284
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,615
The number of teams or
individuals I've spoken to

285
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,117
about this topic who just,

286
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,920
there were logs that
they didn't know existed,

287
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,188
or they're just collecting it

288
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,323
'cause they think
it's a good idea.

289
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,358
We're all a little bit of
data hoarders in our life.

290
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,496
How many people here just
when they get a new computer

291
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,798
just port everything over?

292
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,768
And I still have the papers
I wrote in high school

293
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,970
on this computer
because it's documents.

294
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,238
You just toss it over.

295
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,641
We're all a little
bit of data hoarders.

296
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,611
So the other thing is is
you have a fear with data

297
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,646
that you won't need
it until you do.

298
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,282
And so we easily forget about
the data we're collecting,

299
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,918
the data we're storing,

300
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,422
and you may not need it
until you look for it.

301
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,824
And so because of
that you feel sure,

302
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,059
I'm gonna collect this.

303
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,194
If I need it, great,
then at least I have it.

304
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,964
But if I don't need it it's
not really doing any harm.

305
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,433
And so that's where GDPR
is kind of pushing back

306
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,203
against those notions of
these data hoarding companies.

307
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,540
And it's not that it's,
data collection is bad.

308
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,575
It's that it's forcing
companies to think about

309
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,846
and individuals to think about
why are they collecting it?

310
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,281
Do they need it?

311
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,784
And kind of pushing that
data minimization principles.

312
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,988
But the important thing is
is that logs tell a story.

313
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,491
They help us look and figure
out what is happening,

314
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,293
what's going wrong.

315
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,296
They help us build
and improve systems.

316
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,300
And so it's not that we
don't want to have these,

317
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,870
this ability to do this.

318
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,273
That's why under the
exceptions for GDPR

319
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,809
we have alert monitorings.

320
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,613
I think, hopefully, that gets
expanded a little bit more

321
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,852
to not just be for
alert monitoring,

322
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,187
'cause we need it for
some other good things.

323
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,658
But what's important
to realize, too,

324
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,427
is that they're not
always the same.

325
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,828
Not all logs are equal.

326
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,231
Some logs really provide
vital information

327
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,732
for the most important systems

328
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,668
and others just aren't needed

329
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,671
or they're collecting
data that is really

330
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,744
too much for the system
that it's collecting.

331
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,713
So these can be vastly cut down.

332
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,216
And so I actually work
with teams sometimes

333
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,952
and actually say pull a sample.

334
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,420
Let's walk through everything

335
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,622
that you're pulling and keeping.

336
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,490
And let's make
sure that we're not

337
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,261
logging too much.

338
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,667
But if you asked somebody
what they could log

339
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,970
they would likely
say everything.

340
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,940
So I had a conversation
with a security architect

341
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,144
and I said, what would you
design as your perfect system?

342
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,847
And he'd say I'd say log
everything for a few years.

343
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,050
And I was like, well, one, like
where would you store that?

344
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,285
And how would you store it?

345
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,820
Because that's gonna
get pretty volumeness.

346
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,090
But he's thinking from
the security perspective.

347
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,791
If there's an incident
we're gonna find it,

348
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,027
we're gonna be able to
detect what happened.

349
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,631
And then you have other teams
where security goes and says,

350
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,466
do you log?

351
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,967
And they're going nope,

352
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,870
and the system is holding
social security numbers

353
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,940
or really important PII,

354
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,641
and you're going
you have no logs

355
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,944
to who accessed the system?

356
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,978
And you wanna scream internally.

357
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,319
So the key here is to find
a balance between the two.

358
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,487
And so I'm gonna go back

359
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,223
and talk quickly
about this exception.

360
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,192
Monitoring and alert purposes.

361
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,862
It's not a magic
exception, right?

362
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,497
Everything could
be for monitoring

363
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,999
and alert purposes if
we wanted it to be.

364
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,236
But the reality is
that's not what the GDPR

365
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,704
is getting at the
heart of, right?

366
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,539
They want us to be
able to do our jobs,

367
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,474
but they don't want us
to collect everything.

368
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,148
So one of the important
questions to start evaluating

369
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,149
should you be keeping
this information,

370
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,751
is what system are logging.

371
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,654
You should prioritize
your systems,

372
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,091
figure out which ones have
the most valuable information.

373
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,460
So under the GDPR there's this
concept called data mapping.

374
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,464
Has anyone here done anything
involving data mapping?

375
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,166
Aha, no one.

376
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,269
So data mapping is a
requirement under the GDPR

377
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,706
and what you have to do is
you have to track and map

378
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,075
where all PII is
stored and processed

379
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,677
across an organization.

380
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:02,548
So that means you have to know
where the flows of data are,

381
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,552
what exactly the data is flowing
between system to system,

382
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,254
does it have a security
review, how long is it kept?

383
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,657
What's the retention
policy, et cetera?

384
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,226
And so when you start
mapping out an organization

385
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,764
you're asking questions like
what is stored in that system?

386
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,765
What is collected
by that system?

387
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,535
What data flows
through that system?

388
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,038
And then we ask that
followup question.

389
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,875
Okay, now I know about
the system, is it logging?

390
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,246
What other documents or
systems are using the data

391
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,782
that comes from that?

392
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:41,486
So when you start figuring out
what actually is being logged

393
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,524
you have a better view of
what your situation is.

394
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,026
And then you start
to dig into it.

395
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,162
Well, this was a really
great opportunity.

396
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,664
We're mapping our
entire organization.

397
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,334
You now know what
systems are logging.

398
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,969
You gotta ask what's in them?

399
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,071
What is it what we need?

400
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,173
And you start digging
into whether or not

401
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,809
it's something valuable that
you really, really need.

402
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,578
Which goes to my next slide.

403
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,412
Do you need it?

404
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,849
Someone said, I
put out on Twitter

405
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,985
some good log puns and
jokes because I thought,

406
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,855
add some humor to
a 9 a.m. keynote

407
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,858
and someone said, you know,
you can tell how old the log is

408
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,659
by how many lines are in it.

409
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,461
Which,

410
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,066
it's great when you have really,
really great robust logs,

411
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,836
but what I find is when I
really go back and need them

412
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,273
it's taking longer times
to parse through it.

413
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,608
If we collect too
much information

414
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,677
and we don't really need it,

415
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,245
when we go back to look at it

416
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,781
we're gonna be inundated
by too much data.

417
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,284
So revisiting and looking
at what you really need

418
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,554
when you're collecting
it is really valuable.

419
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,423
And my favorite
question is can we

420
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,393
just take the PII
out of the logs?

421
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,396
And this seems like kind
of an obvious example.

422
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,097
But can we truncate?

423
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,301
Do we really need
the full IP address?

424
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,303
Are you using a user's
email in that log?

425
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,573
Are you using another identifier

426
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,243
or can we maybe convert it
to an internal identifier?

427
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,711
Can we pull out

428
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:18,050
the PII and make it so that
the log is not collecting it?

429
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,419
Can you hash any of the device
IDs when you're storing it?

430
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,455
What is the purpose of the log?

431
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,326
If it's to understand
that there's a unique
event happening,

432
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,429
do you need every little
piece of information in it?

433
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,436
And then this one,
when I talk to folks

434
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,138
I say, well where
are the logs made?

435
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,673
Where are they stored?

436
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,675
Where do you keep them?

437
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,311
The big thing about it is
sometimes you have logs

438
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,678
that you have access to.

439
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,581
Sometimes you have
logs that third parties

440
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,283
are collecting for you.

441
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,718
But one of the most
difficult things under GDPR

442
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,623
is if you are using data that,

443
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,292
or data's being stored
with a third party,

444
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,927
you have to have
a legal agreement

445
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,495
called data
protection agreement,

446
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,931
or data protection, or data
processing agreement, sorry,

447
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,935
commonly referred to as a DPA.

448
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,605
So if you're storing PII on
another third party system

449
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,141
most likely, hopefully,

450
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:20,345
you have an agreement with
that system to store that PII.

451
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,348
But I've run across
instances in the past where

452
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,251
you talk to individuals
and they're throwing logs

453
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,187
on some sort of system that
isn't supposed to have them

454
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,390
or that's not the data,
that's not the system

455
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,992
that you thought they
were being stored on.

456
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,428
And so this all goes towards
that data mapping process.

457
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,864
Figure out where your data is.

458
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,432
Figure out do you need it.

459
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,067
Figure out what
the retention is,

460
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,436
and so one of my favorite things

461
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,772
and biggest headaches
about the GDPR

462
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,075
is that it forces you to
look where your data is

463
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,443
and really examine it.

464
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,745
And ultimately that's
what breaks down here.

465
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,084
So how long do you
really need it?

466
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:03,989
Personal data, if we don't
have any PII in the logs

467
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,258
you can keep it for longer.

468
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,227
You can keep those
logs because you're not

469
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:13,498
worrying about leakage or
having to pull that data,

470
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,467
having to delete that data,

471
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,571
you can,

472
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:24,141
you can work out kind of what
you're collecting specifically

473
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:28,313
and generate a risk
profile for each log

474
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:33,318
and kind of figure out when
and where you need to keep it.

475
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,622
I tell teams that 29
is a magic number.

476
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,124
Well why is that?

477
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,829
Well under the GDPR you have
to delete data within 30 days.

478
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,164
So if you're collecting data,

479
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,502
and you don't wanna build
out a system or process

480
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,071
to go through and
delete that data,

481
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,805
29 days it's gonna auto delete.

482
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,943
So if the person stops
using their system,

483
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,212
after 29 days you don't
have to worry about

484
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,214
running the deletion request

485
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,984
or deletion generally
on a system.

486
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,489
I had another thought and it,

487
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,557
I lost it so if I come
back to this slide

488
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,727
you'll know why.

489
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,796
So who watches the loggers?

490
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,266
Do you have policies
implemented?

491
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,069
Because not everything
is created equal.

492
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,572
If you're logging chat
data or access logs,

493
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:33,278
really it depends on
the purpose of the logs.

494
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,746
And this is really
gonna help when

495
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,349
you're doing data mapping
with your organization

496
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:42,187
is to help figure out what
that right balance is.

497
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,621
And so I said this before,

498
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,457
but retention
policies are a must.

499
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,325
Don't keep everything forever.

500
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,728
It's really not a good idea.

501
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,663
We don't need stale data.

502
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,832
But if you do need
to keep data longer

503
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,501
can you pull out some
of those elements of PII

504
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,870
that might create a
larger risk profile

505
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,005
for that piece of data?

506
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,776
If the IP addresses are
gonna be worthless in a while

507
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,445
or the device IDs are
gonna be worthless,

508
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,146
but you wanna keep
everything else,

509
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,383
can you strip that out and
have basically two tiers?

510
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,552
You collect a certain
set of information.

511
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,920
You keep that maybe
for six months.

512
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,024
After that you wanna use
it for some other purposes.

513
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,092
You strip out some of the
data and you keep it longer.

514
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,863
But figure out what your
retention policy looks like,

515
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,498
and that's gonna really vary

516
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,834
on the type of data
obviously collected.

517
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,003
And this is one of
my favorite points,

518
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,638
is it really a log?

519
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,577
This was one of the
first things I ask teams

520
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,414
or individuals when they
talk to me about logging,

521
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,318
because did you build
a service on top of it?

522
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,353
If you did, it's
no longer a log.

523
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,956
I think people should
stop thinking about

524
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,828
systems that build on top
of logs as actual logs

525
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,030
because if you do
the people advising

526
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,334
or the way you approach it
is gonna be very different.

527
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,872
One good example,
or as I like to say,

528
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,309
one good example of this
is that usually logs

529
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:15,013
that have systems built on
another, build another log.

530
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,582
You've built a system and then
now there's actually the log

531
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:23,588
that the system is involved
with or integrated with.

532
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,125
And one of the best
examples of this

533
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:32,063
that I think is a
GDPR situation is

534
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:37,068
on Nintendo users
notice that one year

535
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,704
after they started
playing a game

536
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,140
that the amount of time
they played in a game

537
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,844
reset to zero at one year.

538
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,981
And they were really angry

539
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,450
because they wanted
their playtime in a game.

540
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,785
And I think that's
very reasonable.

541
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,721
I like to know that
I've put in 42 hours

542
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,424
into Breath of the Wild
because I ran around a lot,

543
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,725
and that's important to me.

544
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,629
What I think happened
here is no one said

545
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,165
to whoever was working
on the retention policies

546
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,369
with this individual or
team who worked on this,

547
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,106
oh we actually put
that data user facing.

548
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,676
We actually care and
build something on this.

549
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,909
This is really valuable.

550
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,780
This isn't just internal
for us as a company

551
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,782
to know how long
people have been

552
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,449
playing in a particular game.

553
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,851
This is actually deleting.

554
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,321
And I think this is
a really good example

555
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,756
of where someone thought this
was just a log of playtime,

556
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,993
and they thought a
year seems reasonable.

557
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,562
But really, it was much
more significant than that

558
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,331
because there was a
system built upon that

559
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,366
to display it to the user.

560
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:43,935
Breach.

561
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,706
So we've talked about
the privacy aspects.

562
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,040
Cutting down the logs,

563
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,943
thinking about data minimization
principles applying,

564
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,746
caring about the GDPR,
what about a breach?

565
00:26:55,914 --> 00:27:00,185
Well, like any incident
response professional

566
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,388
or threat intelligence
professional,

567
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,793
when you talk to the
lawyers they're often

568
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,562
one of the first people to
say well where are the logs?

569
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,163
What do we have?

570
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,531
What do we know
about the incident?

571
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,066
What should I care about?

572
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,334
Do we know there's an intrusion?

573
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,103
Do we know PII was exfiltrated?

574
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,538
Do we know that
PII was accessed?

575
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,641
We're really caring about this.

576
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,879
And if you don't log,

577
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,514
how would you know that the
incident happened at all?

578
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,283
Or that there was a problem?

579
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,486
Because if you're not logging it

580
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,789
did the incident
actually happen?

581
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:42,093
And so the GDPR kind of touches
upon this in their guidance.

582
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,432
Basically they say just
because you have no evidence

583
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,100
of an intrusion
doesn't mean that

584
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,602
that intrusion or that
breach didn't happen.

585
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:55,173
And so it's important
to realize that

586
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,410
proper logging is also
required by the GDPR

587
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,746
because you're supposed to
be looking for detecting

588
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,582
and worrying about intrusions.

589
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,952
But also, breach.

590
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,288
And the reason I say
breach dot dot dot,

591
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,526
not breach excited, is you
may have seen this in the news

592
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:19,497
relatively recently so I
guess it was May of last year,

593
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:24,269
about 25 days before
GDPR went live

594
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,771
where all of a
sudden they found out

595
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,206
that they were logging
plaintext passwords.

596
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,543
My guess is that
GitHub was properly

597
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,610
data mapping their organization,

598
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,247
looking at their data
minimization principles,

599
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,416
looking at what data
they're collecting,

600
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,585
and that's how they
stumbled upon this.

601
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:44,589
So revisiting and looking at
your logs are really important,

602
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,358
but also your logs are a risk.

603
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,928
And if you're not
doing it properly

604
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,629
and you're not
storing them correctly

605
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,964
and you're not
treating them like

606
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,000
the systems that
are generating them,

607
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,002
you're gonna have an incident.

608
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,137
And here's another one.

609
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,106
Twitter, the exact same thing.

610
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:05,143
And of course, they're saying,

611
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,479
I believe both
GitHub and Twitter

612
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,748
they didn't do forced
resets of password,

613
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,550
but what they did say is
we're gonna notify everyone

614
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,552
and let them decide
whether or not

615
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,555
they want to reset
their password,

616
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,660
primarily because they were
saying they had no indication.

617
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,965
And so I think about no
indication means no logs

618
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,333
or they weren't
logging everything.

619
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,568
You can't really tell,

620
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,470
which is why I think
they did notification

621
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,739
but didn't do the forced reset.

622
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,474
It's a balance of the risk.

623
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,444
But ultimately when
you're worrying,

624
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,079
okay, the logs are breached,

625
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,782
you have logs, access
logs to the logs,

626
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,483
it's just logs all the way down.

627
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,418
And so this goes to whether or
not you're building a system

628
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,757
on top of the logs
that you're collecting

629
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,094
because if you have built
a system on access logs

630
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,696
that either provide
to the end user

631
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,399
or provide to someone internally

632
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,968
access profiles or
information about

633
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,473
whatever you can imagine,

634
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,810
are you logging access to that?

635
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,077
If you need PII,

636
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,980
if you need really raw
valuable information,

637
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,850
should you be going
one more layer down

638
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,453
and at least moving
to the next step?

639
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,490
Which is kind of crazy,

640
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,726
because we can keep going and
going and where does it stop?

641
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:33,064
And so the idea is back
to can we have both?

642
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:38,069
It's a constant balance
between privacy and security,

643
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,472
figuring out what you
really need versus

644
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,609
what you absolutely don't need,

645
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,744
and throwing that out

646
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:50,314
because not all systems
and data are the same.

647
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,585
We shouldn't be storing
email addresses in logs.

648
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,321
'Cause really, email
addresses is very easy.

649
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,090
If there is a breach
of email addresses

650
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,059
you're going to have to do
notification to regulators

651
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,995
and likely to consumers
under the GDPR.

652
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,165
If you, instead, put in
an internal identifier,

653
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,068
that's much better because
that internal identifier,

654
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,805
if leaked, we have less
notification requirements,

655
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,775
less cost, and less
risk and worry basically

656
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:22,247
to the individual whose
data is contained within.

657
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,083
And so I said this before,

658
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,618
but it's really,
really important,

659
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,687
figure out which systems are
important and prioritize.

660
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,425
There, everyone has the
two or three places,

661
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,195
or maybe six or seven or 30

662
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,931
where the most important
information is collected.

663
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,733
Sorry, I need to,

664
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,505
and so if you figure
out which are important

665
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:52,176
then you can figure out
what you need to prioritize

666
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,912
and kind of move on from there.

667
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,482
And sometimes the
answer is going to be

668
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,917
you need to log more.

669
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,451
You need to put more data in.

670
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,122
You need to have a
longer retention policy.

671
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,792
Because you're going to
need to do that in order to

672
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,062
see if there's an intrusion
and kind of act accordingly,

673
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:15,667
because having really good
data about the incident

674
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,636
and what has happened
is going to be key

675
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,272
in explaining and telling
the story to the regulator

676
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,475
about what the risks might
be to that individual,

677
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:28,178
because it's never fun
to say to a regulator,

678
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,948
well we don't really
know what happened.

679
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,883
Like, could have
been everything.

680
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:37,855
Or Equifax, who knows
to the extent to which

681
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,692
they know all of that
data was exfiltrated.

682
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,994
But if you don't know you
have to assume the worst

683
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,227
in some situations.

684
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,565
So if you can log
more and log better

685
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,334
then you can better
tell a story,

686
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:55,139
to both consumers
but also regulators.

687
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,176
And good policies are important.

688
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,512
It's important that you shape

689
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,882
what you're collecting.

690
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,185
And for everyone this is
going to be different.

691
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,953
I wish I could come
up here and say,

692
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,156
if you're doing x you
should just keep it y.

693
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,659
But the reality is is
it's a very gray balance,

694
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,528
based on the data
you're collecting

695
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,131
and what you actually
are using it for.

696
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:25,136
And so I have about
15, 10 minutes,

697
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,405
15 minutes left for question.

698
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,040
'Cause I wanted to make sure if

699
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,908
anyone had any questions
they could ask,

700
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,077
but that's pretty
much my presentation,

701
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,014
and I thank you all
again for coming.

702
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,351
(audience applauding)

703
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,254
(light music)
