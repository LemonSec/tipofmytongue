1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,320
well hello welcome everyone

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,200
thanks for joining me today to discuss

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,360
uh what we don't know and how to use

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,719
that to drive our intelligence

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,840
activities so if everyone is ready

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,199
let's get

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,320
to it

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,840
so uh

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
15 years in the marine corps gave me my

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
grounding in the

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,599
intelligence field

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,080
but later i worked in industry both on

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,079
the customer and the vendor side of

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,200
things

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
personally my life consists working on

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
endless renovations and upgrades in my

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
house my big plans for friday night will

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,079
be

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,920
installing installing a new garbage

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,640
disposal um i love to read and learn i

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
love to cook though i do enjoy

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,280
barbecuing and smoking meat i'm afraid

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,199
to save these things around our renowned

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,199
pit master mr rick holland

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,360
um but enough about that let's get

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
talking about what we know what we don't

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,078
know and why it matters

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,520
so our

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,119
presentation today i want to talk to you

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,080
about

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,960
the

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
known unknown matrix

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
the ku matrix otherwise known as the box

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
of knowledge also called the knowledge

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,799
quadrant

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,439
we'll then go on to describe in the

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
context of known unknown information

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
what exactly are

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
intelligence requirements and gaps and

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,360
how to use them

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
we also want to quickly touch on bias

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,079
bias is finally making its way into

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,920
mainstream conversation

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,439
so we'll want to discuss some of the

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,560
ways

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
major cognitive limitations

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
will influence uh how you present your

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
information and create unintended

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,600
intelligence gaps

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
and then i will present a couple of

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,439
practical examples of what you can do

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,119
starting today

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,640
where you can not only identify your

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
gaps but skillfully present that

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,240
information

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,399
and i will do my best to leave some time

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
at the end for questions and of course

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
you can always reach me in slack

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,600
following the presentation and as always

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
i'm available on linkedin

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,800
so

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,959
when we think about knowledge and what

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,080
we actually know about the topic or any

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
topic for that matter when we really

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
look at what we base our beliefs on or

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
what we made our decision off of or when

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
we make our case

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
we often find that the information we

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,440
swore to be solid may not be as

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,640
concrete as we hoped

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
so it's interesting

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,160
to start out writing a presentation

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
about what you don't know and it would

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
seem like it would be fairly simple and

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
short

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
um but in order to understand fully what

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
you

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
don't know the converse is also true you

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
have to understand what you do know

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
and that's not easy either as we all

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,959
know

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,040
when my children were young they used to

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,879
ask me such zen like questions like

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,920
daddy how much do you know um and when

85
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,680
you really think about that try sitting

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,159
with that one over coffee one morning

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
so when we talk about intelligence gaps

88
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,599
we're talking about the intelligence

89
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
information gaps the gaps in

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
understanding uh something the decision

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
maker finds lacking right but before we

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
can identify

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
what information we're missing we need

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159
to look at what we have

95
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,120
um

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,879
there's a common misconception uh in

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,680
general in our industry specifically

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
that admitting you don't know something

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,840
um is somehow like admitting failure um

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
you know that's always better just to

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
nod your head and smile don't ask

102
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
questions and just pretend it's all good

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,760
um

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
and somehow that's supposed to show that

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
you're still the expert that you're

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
supposed to be well that's um

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,799
silly honestly

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,920
because true experts in my opinion know

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
the limits of their understanding and

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
are comfortable talking about them

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,959
um after all it's those uh limits of

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,239
understanding

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,120
um

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,439
the outer boundaries of our knowledge

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,840
that really serve as our guideposts and

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
define our goals

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,358
but that only happens if you truly

118
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,759
understand what you know so i will ask

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,880
you what do you know

120
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
so we're going to look at the known

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,759
unknown matrix the box of knowledge not

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
to be co-mingled with the triangle of

123
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
irritation pyramid of pain circular

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
redundancy

125
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
um as you can see it's fairly simple

126
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,240
right

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
intelligence information and value will

128
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
fall into one of these categories and

129
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
think of these for the paradigm set as

130
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
lands that intelligence people are

131
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
working within and are trying to move

132
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
about

133
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,080
you have your known knowns known unknown

134
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
unknown known and the horrible unknown

135
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,440
unknown

136
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,479
this is not a new concept

137
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,759
in fact the

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
knowledge quadrant

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
received a lot of attention in the early

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
2000s when the us was entering

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,600
the war with iraq secretary of state

142
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
and secretary of defense we're both uh

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,639
very keen on using this terminology um i

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,479
saw it surface recently i think or

145
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
actually put out something only did not

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,440
too long ago about the uh unknown known

147
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,039
but i want to get into these different

148
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,360
lands to show you how this type of

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
information can impact

150
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,919
your presenting

151
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,800
so

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
we go into

153
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
unknown unknown

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,360
this is the worst place to be

155
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
a cti team you can waste a lot of time

156
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
in this place you

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
cannot think of everything that you

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,639
don't know

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
the technical side of the house those

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,320
folks will often first want to figure

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,240
out some way to download the internet

162
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,680
and then they'll figure out the filters

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
later first we have to get all the data

164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
in the system we have to get our tip

165
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
with all eight million iocs and then

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,039
we'll worry about what we're looking for

167
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,960
later on the flip side of that you have

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,039
your more traditional analytical folk

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
that came from the intel community

170
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
and they want to sit in a cloistered

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
room and think of every possible

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,960
question they might encounter and then

173
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,639
build requirements off of that before

174
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
ever writing a single product

175
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,759
this land of unknown unknown is always

176
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,720
going to be

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,639
magnitudes larger than the other lambs

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,800
and every time you gay ground gain

179
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
ground and no known

180
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,880
um it's exponentially increasing in what

181
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
you don't know about that topic

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,840
so try not to spend too much time here

183
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
in unknown

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
known this is

185
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,960
where

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
you can

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
save money really this is where the cti

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,360
team can find a

189
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
change in accounts cushions if you will

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,400
somewhere a very lonely knowledge

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
management professional is stirring in

192
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
their sleep because i'm telling you that

193
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
your organization

194
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
all the different parts that make up

195
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,520
your company that sit around your team

196
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
they have a lot of knowledge sitting

197
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
there uncataloged unfiltered unused

198
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,039
um

199
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,759
but it's usually very accessible if you

200
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,000
only knew that it existed

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
if you have

202
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
questions about

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,639
um potential impact of a ddos a specific

204
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,039
ddos attack that's going to you know

205
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,880
that could impact your organization

206
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
before you write that assessment for the

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
boss you might want to talk to your own

208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
ddos team um

209
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
or your ddos protection vendor they have

210
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,039
a lot of information and they're already

211
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,520
paid for before you write your cti

212
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,319
assessment for leadership um if you want

213
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,280
to know about all the truly really scary

214
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,639
vulnerabilities

215
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
um and gaps in your defenses go down and

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080
hang out in the the smoke pit the vape

217
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,599
pit next to the security operations

218
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,560
center

219
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,479
you'll learn quite a bit um spending

220
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,240
some time with the actual hands-on

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,000
keyboard defenders down there

222
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
i would say that 90 to 99

223
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
of what a good intel team

224
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,240
um actually needs to do their job

225
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
all that information already exists

226
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,919
inside the organization

227
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
they just need to find the right person

228
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,479
the right tool to get it

229
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,840
you don't need new feeds for this you

230
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,360
don't need new tools but you do need

231
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,840
process and you need awareness why would

232
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
you pay extra for something if you

233
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
already have it organic to your

234
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
organization that's money saved

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
the next land

236
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
is known unknown and this is where

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
uh we spend most of our time or you

238
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,599
should spend most of your time as an

239
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,279
intel organization

240
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
um this is where your intelligence

241
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
requirements comes from and also your

242
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
gaps are discovered this is how you

243
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,600
begin to tap into unknown knowns oh

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
that's a gap hey we know that the key to

245
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
this land is writing down what you need

246
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
to know and sharing it within your org

247
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
these requirements

248
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,959
come from a collaboration process with

249
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,560
your stakeholder i know we talked about

250
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,959
it in the last session with sherman you

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,399
have to work with your stakeholder to

252
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,640
not only define requirements but also

253
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
manage those expectations

254
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
once you have your requirements then you

255
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
can identify what you already have in

256
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
place what are the resources

257
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
um

258
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,640
and the information that you have

259
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
readily available and what do you still

260
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
need what are the gaps um where are they

261
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,880
coming from but you have to have

262
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,720
requirements tracking system underneath

263
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
all of that

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,519
this should be part of your collection

265
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,360
plan before you even go off to answer

266
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
these questions is figure out what do we

267
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
actually know and then what is out there

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,279
that we have to

269
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,240
collect now gaps are okay you don't hide

270
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
from them and you certainly don't ignore

271
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
them uh use those gaps to frame your

272
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
analysis

273
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,959
known unknowns satisfying requirements

274
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,360
filling the gaps um this should be where

275
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
you spend most of your time as an intel

276
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
person this is how you justify your

277
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,279
existence and this is how you tie your

278
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,880
value

279
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
as an intelligence professional

280
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,479
to the organization's dollars

281
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,640
the whole idea that an intelligence team

282
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
needs to be the super smartest experts

283
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,160
in the room and they know everything

284
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,440
about everything

285
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
um

286
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
really hurts the industry and there is a

287
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,040
tendency for people to shy away from the

288
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
fact that they don't know something

289
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,920
that's okay somebody in your

290
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
organization does there's a lot of smart

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,519
people in your organization that have a

292
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
lot of really good information

293
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
sometimes

294
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
it's not the role of intelligence to

295
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,399
know something

296
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
but it's their role to facilitate to

297
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,760
make sure the information that already

298
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,240
exists gets the right um decision maker

299
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
in time for them to make a confident

300
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
decision

301
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
they're even happier when the decision

302
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
maker doesn't have to write a check for

303
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
an additional tool to use the resources

304
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
that you already have by documenting

305
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
this showing where you get your

306
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
information planning out your collection

307
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,880
activities um showing how you have gaps

308
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
how you fill them that makes your

309
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,839
decision makers happy

310
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,760
all right on to the final land uh no no

311
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
this is you know intelligence nirvana

312
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,519
the promised land for all of us

313
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,320
intelligence weanings um you have the

314
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,880
right information you know you have it

315
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,519
you know where it is and you can readily

316
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,440
produce it in a timely manner to support

317
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
the decision maker so they can make that

318
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,680
confident decision

319
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
sadly

320
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,279
for all you pet lovers out there with

321
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
amazon showing up at the perfect time uh

322
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
the sun sets quickly here if you don't

323
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,279
keep at it you will find yourself in

324
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
known unknown and unknown known very

325
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,800
quickly

326
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,640
the two greatest obstacles to providing

327
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
excellent intelligence to a decision

328
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,360
maker or time and awareness

329
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
everything expires over time

330
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
and awareness you have to be aware of

331
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
not only what you're going after but

332
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
what your audience needs your

333
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
stakeholders what are they requiring

334
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,040
from you what are your customers

335
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
actually using your information for

336
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,160
you don't necessarily have to have

337
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
all the information available at any

338
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
given time to provide exceptional

339
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,880
decision support but you and your

340
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
decision maker your stakeholder whoever

341
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
you're providing intelligence to they

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
must understand what information you do

343
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
have what you don't have

344
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,639
why what is truly needed and what is

345
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,040
just a want um it all goes back to

346
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,720
managing those expectations i know

347
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
sherman touched on that in the last

348
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,240
presentation

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
so now that we've talked about the lands

350
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,440
of known and unknown

351
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,600
let's actually talk a little bit more

352
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
about how do we start using this

353
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
information and thinking about how we

354
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,959
use this information

355
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,200
sadly one of my favorite teachers and

356
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
authors passed away last week so i

357
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,399
thought i'd share a quote of his

358
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,200
we need to always be looking at

359
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,920
what we know and how why we came to know

360
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,639
it

361
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,440
um

362
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,720
there are no absolutes in the

363
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,680
intelligence world and we must maintain

364
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,079
an awareness of what we think we know

365
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,680
so our decision makers are happiest when

366
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,000
we're in the land of no knowns

367
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
decisions are made quickly because

368
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
everything that they want to know is in

369
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,440
one quick email slack or discord

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
we also know that no known is a mythical

371
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
place semi-mythical

372
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,160
and the intel unicorns are only found in

373
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,399
cti job descriptions

374
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,880
because information changes it stales

375
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
it's updated it evolves on the variables

376
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
expand and um shrink

377
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
so the reality is we're constantly in

378
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,000
the land of known unknowns we know what

379
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,639
we need to make the decision maker happy

380
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,560
and we want to cross back over into the

381
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,199
no knowns if only we just have these few

382
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,279
things right then we'd all be good and

383
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,760
of course even better once we know them

384
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
we don't ever have to worry about them

385
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,480
again

386
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,120
not so much

387
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,040
some things we'll never know and that's

388
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
okay uh some things

389
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
we can't know today tomorrow um

390
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,680
but we can with time that's okay but

391
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,279
before we run off and try to get

392
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,199
something new we always should take that

393
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,959
moment to let you know check with your

394
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,120
neighbors see what they have see what

395
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,480
they already know

396
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
um

397
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
so check within your org first

398
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
um there's lots of things to think about

399
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
when we try to operationalize

400
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
you know seeking after the unknown

401
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,399
information but that's okay it's

402
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,199
awareness right

403
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,639
there is a common uh phrase corporate

404
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,600
knowledge right so when somebody

405
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,880
leaves the team

406
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
or these organizations there's a little

407
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,959
bit of frustration that oh the corporate

408
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,959
knowledge that they took with them

409
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,519
it's all that understanding of process

410
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,560
and experience that disappears when a

411
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,839
seasoned member

412
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
of the team leaves

413
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
so when that team member leaves

414
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
there's a belief that all that knowledge

415
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
leaves with them but that's not

416
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,079
necessarily true it doesn't just

417
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,399
disappear it's just now cut off from

418
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,480
that team all that knowledge still

419
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,680
exists it just exists outside of your

420
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,360
particular silo of excellence

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
that's why it's critical to have a means

422
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
to publish your intelligence gaps

423
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,399
publish your requirements

424
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,360
before you go commit to spending time

425
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
and resources and collecting information

426
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
the information you need might already

427
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
exist inside your organization it's just

428
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,160
an unknown right just no one knows you

429
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,120
need it so if you assume that no one

430
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,800
could possibly know what you need to

431
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
know or have what you need then you're

432
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
ready for our next topic first of all

433
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,920
but um you need to remember that you

434
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,519
and your team

435
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,720
alone as just the intel folks you cannot

436
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
fill your decision makers intelligence

437
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,279
gaps you cannot satisfy the requirements

438
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
requirements all by yourself you need to

439
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,959
work

440
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
collaboratively across your organization

441
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
there are many smart people who would

442
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,800
love to share what they know

443
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
um about

444
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
their you know your organization and

445
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,920
what they do on a daily basis that has

446
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,000
relevance to you you just have to you

447
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,399
know buy them coffee write down you know

448
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,759
ask them questions and write it all down

449
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
for you pet lovers out there

450
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
um

451
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,240
so we're going to go into another topic

452
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,759
that has a huge impact on intelligence

453
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,680
gaps um

454
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
has a massive impact on how you look for

455
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,399
information how you analyze it once you

456
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
find it how you present it what you

457
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
consider as a gap and that's bias

458
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
everybody has it it cannot be helped

459
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,440
it's shaped by your experience your

460
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,839
education your general societal exposure

461
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,759
you can't

462
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
get rid of it but you can at least be

463
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
aware of it and mitigate the effects in

464
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
your intelligence reporting and

465
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
collection

466
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,599
so much like a good uh lao tzu quote

467
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,839
know thyself you know we cyber security

468
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,439
professionals we love to talk about

469
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,039
cognitive biases

470
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,720
um if you spend any time with this

471
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
subject taking any classes you'll know

472
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,599
that there are a lot um

473
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,880
there's at least

474
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
i have a list of at least 60 that came

475
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,559
out of this book and there's many more

476
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,760
on top of that if you're looking at

477
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,079
different industries um way too many to

478
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
discuss here and

479
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,679
honestly if your intelligence program is

480
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,039
not up to speed where you're ready to

481
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,840
tackle full-on structured analytical

482
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,360
techniques

483
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
just a basic understanding will suffice

484
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
but if you want to know more and since i

485
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
know that everybody has this book on

486
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,039
their desktop for easy to access

487
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,360
reference

488
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,679
i would like you to look at chapter two

489
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,080
on structured techniques uh specifically

490
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,440
2.3

491
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
on cognitive limitations um it'll give

492
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
you a good overview of how these impact

493
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
your day-to-day work

494
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,120
the authors fearson and hoyer junior

495
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,520
they provide it's a solid overview

496
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,679
um on cognitive

497
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
on cognitive biases misapplied

498
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
heuristics and intuitive traps

499
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
but the three one the three big ones

500
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
that i want to touch on are confirmation

501
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,679
bias you see that a lot in the news

502
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,799
these days

503
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,400
where you're looking for things that you

504
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,679
agree with

505
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,520
and discarding everything else

506
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,240
groupthink which is you know always

507
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,679
trust the group to make the best

508
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,440
decisions for the individual um

509
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,360
and you discard anything that individual

510
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,160
has to say or problem is groupthink also

511
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,679
encourages individuals not to say

512
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
anything and then the big one that i

513
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,480
think impacts larger organizations

514
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,919
especially is projecting past

515
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,919
experiences well this is the way we've

516
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,440
always done it well that's what happened

517
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,679
to us last year um you have to be

518
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,080
careful of those um the more you read

519
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
about them the more you study them the

520
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,760
more you'll start seeing them come out

521
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
in your work and other people's works um

522
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,240
but you know how does this impact your

523
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
intelligence gaps well

524
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,120
for starters do you actually

525
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,280
know what you think you know and just

526
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
because it was true a year ago or a

527
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
month ago or a year ago

528
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,640
doesn't mean that it's still true now

529
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,600
when you made that decision a year ago

530
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
what were your gaps at the time

531
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
what lack of resources did you have

532
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,000
different tooling systems

533
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
there's so many different variables that

534
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
might have been different so even if the

535
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,120
facts remain the same the context has

536
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,919
shifted and do you know why

537
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,039
now some of you might see the

538
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,600
implications of this so not only saying

539
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
that you have to find new information

540
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
but you have to go back and review

541
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
everything that you ever knew to be true

542
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
in the past is that what i'm saying

543
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,240
um

544
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
yeah actually but you don't have to do

545
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
it all at once so as you are

546
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,880
you know

547
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760
if all of a sudden we had iranian ddos

548
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
attacks again like abil back in 2014 13

549
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
and 14.

550
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,600
all that information is still valid but

551
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
it doesn't necessarily dictate what's

552
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,600
going to happen tomorrow in today's

553
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
crisis so

554
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,559
use

555
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,480
the past to understand how you came to

556
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
those conclusions that analysis those

557
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,799
recommendations to shape what you're

558
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,039
doing but don't rely on it as fact

559
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,880
because the threat actors might be

560
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,240
different they might be more involved

561
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,679
the techniques have changed lots of

562
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,440
things are different so what you knew to

563
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
be true is likely to be different as

564
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,039
well

565
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
and looking at the slide think about

566
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,679
those phrases

567
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,200
this is how we've always done it think

568
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,520
about where they might lead you

569
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
um or others astray

570
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,679
now

571
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
can you

572
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,640
fix all of these um in a day can you fix

573
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,240
these for yourself can you suddenly be

574
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
aware of all your biases and change that

575
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,480
um can you fix it in your team no of

576
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
course not

577
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,400
but that's okay so the path to cyber

578
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
enlightenment begins with awareness

579
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,360
right so being aware of the bias first

580
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,039
and then helping each other work through

581
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,720
that and plan for it

582
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
is the path of success

583
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,039
and so

584
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,520
we move on i don't know who actually

585
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,960
wrote the script

586
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,520
the lines for yoda but whoever that is i

587
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,960
could probably follow around the desert

588
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
for a while and learn quite a bit

589
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,559
um

590
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
and all this all this yarning aside like

591
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
how do we put this to work how do i get

592
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
to actually do this and apply my

593
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,960
intelligence gaps to my day-to-day work

594
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,240
right

595
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,880
so practical application um

596
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
here's a sample intelligence report

597
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
template

598
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,360
um or half of it at least this is

599
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,919
what we use at recfast

600
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,480
we're coaching teams if you look at any

601
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
intelligence community agency report

602
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
chances are it's going to have at least

603
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,520
the similar headings

604
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,280
format

605
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
it could be metadata that the customer

606
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,480
residency

607
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,760
really doesn't matter but i wanted to

608
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,240
highlight a couple of things uh there

609
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,760
are a couple of opportunities to not

610
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
only catch your bias but kind of refine

611
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
your requirements identify your gaps

612
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,720
refine those gaps and that's peer review

613
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,760
so in this example

614
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
you know before the analyst goes to

615
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,320
publish this report that they've written

616
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,080
not only just to check for grammar

617
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,720
spelling readability and voice

618
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,440
but we also want somebody to check the

619
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
key assumptions so key assumptions check

620
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
being one of those structured analytical

621
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,159
techniques um that's found in that book

622
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,159
that people often use

623
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,159
that can be very simple of just the

624
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,480
analysts

625
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
assuming that they know something to be

626
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,159
true the brain doesn't like missing

627
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,080
puzzle pieces and will often work

628
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,360
subconsciously to to fill in the missing

629
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,679
gaps so it takes another person ideally

630
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,960
several to help that the author identify

631
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,240
those

632
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,200
this is the opportunity for the reviewer

633
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,320
to play devil's advocate um to ask the

634
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,799
questions who the why the so what who

635
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,440
cares how do you know this cite your

636
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,720
source right

637
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,320
so that's one example

638
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,799
and then in the same report going down

639
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,520
to the next few um

640
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,000
fields

641
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,000
you actually have a section on

642
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,159
intelligence gaps this is something that

643
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,919
i was always impressed with coming out

644
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,640
of the intel community and starting in

645
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,559
the corporate side the american express

646
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,159
team was really good when they wrote

647
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,559
reports they had a actual segment in

648
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,360
there on intelligence gaps um

649
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,720
they're admitting what was still out

650
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
there and they're letting the decision

651
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,799
maker know what that person can't know

652
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,559
or won't know in time

653
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
um by highlighting the gaps you're

654
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,240
showing that a

655
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,159
you've thought about this problem right

656
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,039
you

657
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,640
you understand that there's things that

658
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,400
you can't provide and they might want to

659
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,559
know but you're you're managing those

660
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
expectations you're helping the decision

661
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,360
maker

662
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
with more accurate

663
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
information

664
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
so there you go there's two examples in

665
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,520
one report today how you can start

666
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
making a change and start checking uh

667
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080
not only your bias but start publishing

668
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,480
your gaps like i recommended um

669
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,880
yesterday gert talked about the you know

670
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,559
techniques of forecasting and brought up

671
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,760
a great point

672
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,520
you have to put in the work to get what

673
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,679
you want and there's no it's just the

674
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,480
same

675
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,159
when you're identifying intelligence

676
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,679
gaps and refining your require

677
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,919
requirements um

678
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,000
and then garrett brought up on feedback

679
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
and feedback is critical for refining

680
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
requirements um we all do it poorly but

681
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,279
it needs to be done this is this is how

682
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,000
you follow the intelligence cycle

683
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
something as simple as

684
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,720
cso asks did you see this

685
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
analyst writes a response sends it back

686
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,480
that's all current intelligence as

687
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,039
sherman allen outlined um did you see

688
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
this zero day or whatnot but there's

689
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,200
still a process there that you can apply

690
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,840
um feedback refines your requirements um

691
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,440
by sticking to this process that's how

692
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
you fight you know sherman's tyranny of

693
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
current intelligence or what i call like

694
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,000
the uh the shiny headline syndrome

695
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
it's having that process having deep

696
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,760
structure to your process

697
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,159
um that keeps you out of the shallow

698
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,799
low-impact waters um even katie and

699
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,960
melanie yesterday bringing up um the

700
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,880
type of thoughtful needs analysis should

701
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,120
go into who you hire for your program

702
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,880
it's the same process and now your

703
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,120
product is the intelligence team not

704
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
just the report you write with you know

705
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
the information

706
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,440
you've collected

707
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,360
uh so

708
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
for a quick recap

709
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
we have talked about the known unknown

710
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,919
matrix we talked about what knowledge is

711
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,240
what you know what you can know

712
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
um

713
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,120
we talked specifically how the land of

714
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
known unknowns is how you drive your

715
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,919
intelligence requirements and identify

716
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,600
your intelligence gaps

717
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,720
um

718
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
you might be able to satisfy those

719
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,360
requirements fill those gaps if you tap

720
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,440
into the land of unknown knowns

721
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,720
let people know

722
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
hey we're looking for this does anybody

723
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,919
else have this

724
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,919
um we'll also talk about how we talked

725
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,559
about how your own cognitive limitations

726
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,120
your bias has impacts what you know and

727
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,279
what you don't know um

728
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,480
even as you know your bias of

729
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
other teams couldn't possibly be as

730
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,799
smart as the intel team right

731
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,799
you may think you're in the land of no

732
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,520
known but you very well could be wrong

733
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,840
and then one key point i should probably

734
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,679
have dedicated a whole slide to is time

735
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,279
and awareness

736
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,960
time and awareness the obstacles are

737
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,360
providing great intelligence over time

738
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360
and with lack of awareness you know

739
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,440
intelligence information will suffer

740
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,400
entropy

741
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
um

742
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
there's a lot here

743
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,799
and i get it that operationally this is

744
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,679
a lot to keep track of but once again

745
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
if you have a process in place you have

746
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,360
the tools you have requirements

747
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,200
management and source management

748
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
customer management all that good stuff

749
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,760
um you can do this it's a repeatable

750
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,480
process and it is scalable as well

751
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,240
a lot of it goes into working with your

752
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
your stakeholder the recipient of your

753
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
intelligence it's a collaborative

754
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,919
process it's agile you're constantly

755
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,679
checking back in do you like me yes or

756
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,440
no check the box right

757
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
um

758
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,080
not everything can be known and that's

759
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,760
okay um

760
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,840
it's understanding why not which helps

761
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,279
the decision maker

762
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,240
and

763
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,760
sometimes that can actually add to their

764
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
confidence is understanding what they

765
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,880
can and cannot have

766
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,559
and a couple of simple techniques that

767
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,600
we talked about today um putting in uh

768
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
your intelligence gaps in your report

769
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,919
and your requirements announcing what

770
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,279
you need to know see what other people

771
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,440
can help with and that peer review

772
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,919
show your work check your work prove to

773
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,480
you know somebody before you send it out

774
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,159
for publishing you know

775
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,039
why i know this and to be true

776
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,640
um so that's something you can implement

777
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,240
today um over the next 6 12 18 months

778
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,000
you know you got to have a plan just

779
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,159
like building a team takes planning and

780
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,000
effort the same thing goes to actually

781
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,320
pushing out your intelligence work

782
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
and remember your library of

783
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,919
requirements are what it's a long list

784
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,240
of things that you need to know to for

785
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,960
decision makers to make decisions

786
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,640
if you share them they won't necessarily

787
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,559
be gaps because other people can can

788
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,600
fill in those those blanks

789
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,679
so that is

790
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,159
all i have
