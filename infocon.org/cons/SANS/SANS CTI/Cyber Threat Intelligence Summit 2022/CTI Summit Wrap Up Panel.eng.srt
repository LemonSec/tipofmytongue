1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,600
i always enjoy this final panel because

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,000
it's sort of a reflection time and a

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,480
time to hit on anything that we haven't

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
covered already yeah like

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,400
so many speakers have hit so many topics

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,000
but of course there are always things

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
that

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,400
we didn't talk about there are too many

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,160
topics in this so

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,199
um yeah i would like to welcome to the

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,199
virtual stage

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,519
uh folks from our advisory board

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,679
previous speakers so they're all going

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,920
to come on and on face mute and

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
basically this is just time if you have

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
questions for us

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,120
and sans folks maybe you can point me is

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
there a hallway channel

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
we have

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,320
is it the summit discussion or

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,160
discussion you want to make it somewhat

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
discussion let's just make it one summit

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,120
discussion so if you have things that

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,879
you want uh the panel to talk about if

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,879
you have questions just uh go to one

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,559
summit discussion we'll make it nice and

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,840
simple there

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
um so the first topic to kick off and

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,399
with my apologies i cannot remember the

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,879
person who brought this up yesterday but

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,159
someone said yesterday like there's a

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
lot of content at this summit awesome

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,159
content geared to beginners which we

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,000
want to focus on we have the new to

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
cyber threat intelligence channel that's

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
awesome but they said hey there are also

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,400
folks here who are maybe mid or you know

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
longer

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
on in their careers and so i'd love to

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
get everyone's take on what advice do we

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,960
have for those who are maybe mid or

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
senior career

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
how can they grow what are your thoughts

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,560
on what they should be doing to advance

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
their careers

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,759
who wants to start lillian raised her

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
hand oh my gosh moderator's dream

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
go for

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
this is actually a habit um that we

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
picked up at least in our company um

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,479
just to be very intentional making sure

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,079
that everybody has an opportunity to

53
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
speak so you raise your hand and you

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,439
care when you stack

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,840
um one of the things that i'm always

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,320
going to encourage people is advocate

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,799
for yourselves um again you know in my

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,600
talk and in some of the other talks

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,399
we talk about this imposter syndrome and

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
to some degree absolutely there are

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
certain identities in certain people who

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,239
have impostor syndrome but imposter

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,959
syndrome to a certain degree is also yes

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
um it's just an expectation um that is

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,840
placed on certain people to speak and

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
not speak get rid of it just speak use

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
your voice talk when you want to talk

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
um

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,239
one of the things and this is very

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
challenging for me you know i talked

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
about this in my keynote

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,480
is like speaking up for myself and

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
advocating for myself it's really

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
uncomfortable

75
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,920
but i can say that it's been

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,959
pretty successful um when i left booze

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,800
alvin i was i was a people manager with

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,319
news allen and i left and i joined the

79
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
opera as an individual contributor

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,480
i decided that you know there were just

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
some aspects of of who's alan's method

82
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,959
of people management that i was just not

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,400
a fan of

84
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,519
um

85
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,360
but when i got to yahoo i had really

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,040
intentional conversations with my

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,599
manager and my stick level manager and

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,920
talked about how hey if there's an

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
opportunity i'd like to give this a shot

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
and when i

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
um left to go out on maternity leave

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
um a job to leave my team actually

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
opened up and my manager called me on

94
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
maternity leave and said do you want

95
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,879
this and i said well we can either hire

96
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
an idiot or i can be that idiot so i put

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
my hand up and i got hired as that

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,599
manager um

99
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,000
coming out of maternity leave and so if

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you don't voice it or express it or

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,159
advocate for yourself and say this is

102
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
where i want to go in my career

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,799
oftentimes people won't know to help you

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
um they can guess but it also goes

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
towards um that platinum rule which is

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,080
treat people how they want to be treated

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
and for me to know how you want to be

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
treated you need to tell me

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,480
so that's kind of my piece of advice

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
i've got one that can build on becca

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
yesterday in systems for what i do with

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,720
the team at digital shadows i kind of

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
bucket training and development into

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,840
three different areas one is there's

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
just internal training that we can do so

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
we do lunch and learns we go we do brown

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,480
bags we might have someone that's an

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
expert on russian cyber criminal

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
tradecraft that's leveling up the teams

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
that aren't the russian linguists and

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,519
things like that so it doesn't cost me

122
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,440
any money from my budget to do that then

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,360
we also i worked with the cfo this year

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
and we got a dollar amount per employee

125
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,680
for training at their own discretion and

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
i like to talk about it like a venn

127
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
diagram there's like the needs of my

128
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
company there's the desire of the

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
employee they're never going to be 100

130
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
overlap but let's get as much as we can

131
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,639
but give someone they want to go to a

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,400
bellingham course or something like that

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
okay cool oh cent ties into what we do

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
is there and then the third one which i

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,479
try to keep separate and i've done it

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,680
this year in the budget i keep it

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
separate from the individual training

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
budget is

139
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
tooling so let's say it's on the

140
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,520
security team i'll give an example it's

141
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,039
it's z scalar or maybe it's um

142
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,120
uh passive total or whatever it is i

143
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
have product specific training for the

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
people that own those so i try to do

145
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
internal training that we just do to

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,199
lunch lunch and learns also rotations

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,720
we've done rotations on teams to

148
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
different functional areas within the

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
groups then individual headcount budget

150
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
it's not huge money but at least people

151
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,560
have a little discretion and then i have

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,120
the actual tooling specific and then we

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
have development plans there you know

154
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,919
it's a work in progress we're always

155
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,199
working towards it and things like that

156
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,880
but that's one thing that i've done and

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,039
worked with the cfo on specifically

158
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
so i think for mid and

159
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,039
more senior level cti um one of the

160
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
biggest things that i've discovered is i

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,960
have a lot more face time with a lot

162
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,800
more of my customers

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
and you know from a personal development

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
sort of angle

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,199
you know i really

166
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
start doing more presentations

167
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
and really training my sort of verbal

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,880
uh uh presentation skills right um

169
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
and that's

170
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
watching videos uh you know sometimes

171
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
talks about how you can be a better ted

172
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,000
talker right stuff like that um and it's

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
very critical because

174
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,759
you know i think one you you you have

175
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,600
this direct face time with your customer

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,199
and you want to relay critical

177
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
information as clean and concise as

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,600
possible but also being able to receive

179
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
what they're you know what they're

180
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
talking what they're relating right so

181
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
that is on the more personal growth path

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
that i'm currently still doing and uh

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,680
it's really hard to master talking in

184
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
front of a lot of people

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,400
i don't know that anyone masters it it's

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
just practice and i think that's a great

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,199
one tony what do you think on this topic

188
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,880
you know one of the biggest things that

189
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,600
i guess i would always advocate is

190
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
never stop learning from

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
your peers

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,319
um

193
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,720
cti was not something that i got to do

194
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
by default in law enforcement we had

195
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
intel analysts that did intel analyst

196
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,639
stuff

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
at private sector we had other groups

198
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
that did that and from an investigation

199
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,479
standpoint we didn't talk to the intel

200
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
folks when it came to anything i had to

201
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,680
learn this

202
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
and it's the same thing if you're in

203
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,080
intel one of the best ways to

204
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
really enhance your acumen is you know

205
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,479
what are your ir people doing what are

206
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,880
your pen testers doing what are your

207
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,360
finance people doing you know you never

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,160
know what that that linchpin could be

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,599
where you can pivot into something

210
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,360
different or use your technical

211
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
expertise to actually help

212
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
another area out that may not know what

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,240
that is uh you know case in point with a

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
lot of that cryptocurrency stuff that we

215
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
had in my presentation

216
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,000
that is something that i'm getting a lot

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,680
of forensic accountants

218
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,919
asking me about um just not like on the

219
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,840
outside world and through the network

220
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,039
like hey tony what do i got to do with

221
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,479
cryptocurrency because i'm starting to

222
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
see that you know affecting us as a

223
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,160
company

224
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,479
and if you're if you if that's your

225
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,520
niche you've got a whole other industry

226
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
that is chomping at the bid for you

227
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,560
honey as you were talking i just had a

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
thought

229
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
one of the things i'm working on in my

230
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,520
career development is better partnering

231
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
with teams across the organization

232
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,720
i think this kind of uh is reminiscent

233
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
of samara's talk right integrated

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
intelligence but what i'm learning is

235
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
that especially as i'm advancing as a

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
leader

237
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,840
um or trying to improve and and

238
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
make me my impact and my team's impact

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,360
more partnering with those across the

240
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
organization is key right i'm going out

241
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
and meeting product folks marketing

242
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,279
folks it might differ depending on your

243
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
organization but i think that's one

244
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
thing i'd recommend that especially if

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,519
you're trying to get to a leadership

246
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
level first time manager etc i think

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
talking to different teams and leaders

248
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,000
in your organization making strategic

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
partnerships

250
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,839
is something i would really recommend

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,360
brian what are your thoughts on career

252
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
development mid-senior level what do you

253
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,560
got for us

254
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,800
well i think

255
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
that

256
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,680
one thing you have to remember is it's

257
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,519
your career it's your responsibility

258
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
right so

259
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
you're waiting for somebody else to take

260
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,880
a huge interest in your career

261
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
development is not a good strategy um

262
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
and just like

263
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,680
you know

264
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,360
william said you know be mindful of what

265
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
you actually want and uh what tony

266
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,839
brought up is you know you ask questions

267
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,360
you go out and meet people even you like

268
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,800
when you're reaching out to other teams

269
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,399
find out what's out there

270
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
if you're interested in this type of

271
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
intel go figure it out when i was in the

272
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
marine corps

273
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
um

274
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
cyber intelligence still hadn't you know

275
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,959
intelligence was over here and the cyber

276
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,080
stuff was over here and they still

277
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,920
hadn't bridged the gap yet

278
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
so i spent a lot of time on my own

279
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
taking

280
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,279
sans classes and getting certifications

281
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,720
um because that's where my interest was

282
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
and eventually that's where my career

283
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
led me so a big part of it is if you're

284
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
interested in advancing your career you

285
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,399
need to invest in it and take

286
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,560
responsibility for it may not be in the

287
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
organization you're in

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,839
um and just be open to that so

289
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
jd what do you got for us you have a

290
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
slightly different perspective and i

291
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
love that right from your academic

292
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
perspective you bring what are your

293
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,200
thoughts on this

294
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
uh both from the practitioner and the

295
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
academic side the the first line would

296
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,839
be

297
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
the further forward you want to go the

298
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
deeper and further back you're going to

299
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,560
have to reach

300
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,279
um you're in order to

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
solve challenges you haven't encountered

302
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
or that your organization hasn't

303
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,399
encountered before you're going to have

304
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
to find equivalent tradecraft from other

305
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
disciplines you're going to have to find

306
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
other intelligence history and other

307
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
dynamics that you can adapt into this

308
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
environment there's nothing new under

309
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,279
the sun we just need to

310
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
understand the parallels where the

311
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,440
theory works and where it falls down

312
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
and potentially to bridge into new

313
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
theory

314
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,399
and the second piece i'll give you is

315
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
find the folks that are in equivalent

316
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
positions or were in equivalent

317
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,200
positions to you

318
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,920
as your peers and as your

319
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
support group your fellowship groups um

320
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
it's not merely a matter of finding

321
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,240
folks that can mentor you and be

322
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
this kind of senior rabbi to move you

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
through your career um the most

324
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,440
important folks you will find are the

325
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
folks that had to make it up as they

326
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,160
went along

327
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
and did so in the way you're having to

328
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
make it up as they went along

329
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
um

330
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
you know and i i can call out the folks

331
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,399
that have been important to me over the

332
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,440
years

333
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,279
you know and not all of them were core

334
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,079
cyber folks i mean jan herring um he was

335
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,200
national intelligence officer for

336
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
science and technology at one point in

337
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,320
time taught me a tremendous amount even

338
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,600
though he sits in the competitive

339
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
intelligence field

340
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,440
john mccreary uh sits up in the warning

341
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,959
field and did a lot with jay too

342
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,120
unfortunately he's passed on now um i

343
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,519
can talk about jan herring who uh

344
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,880
bluntly without him we wouldn't have

345
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,279
cynthia grabo's work i can talk about

346
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
folks like dave i tell even though he

347
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,880
worked in the pure offensive side he's

348
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,480
taught me a tremendous amount over the

349
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
years um i won't i won't name some

350
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
others because i know i would probably

351
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
embarrass them

352
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
not the folks i usually throw out there

353
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
but um there are very few folks that

354
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,040
walk the same roads that you will have

355
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,680
find them and spend the time to get to

356
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,079
know them

357
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,560
love it becca what do you think

358
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
i was just going to throw out

359
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
that

360
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
some point in your career many of you i

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,920
know i am in a little bit in the middle

362
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,560
of this um will realize that like you

363
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
have a choice and you have a say in what

364
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,040
you want to do and before you can get to

365
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,480
that point where you

366
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,720
advocate for promotions or anything like

367
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
that you should make sure you're

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
actually doing what you want

369
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,519
and so i was just going to recommend a

370
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,040
book there's a really great there's two

371
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,399
books actually one's called designing

372
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,760
your life and the other is called

373
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
designing your work life i may or may

374
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
not be reading that right now that

375
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
really helps you zero in on your

376
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
passions and your inspiration and what's

377
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
important to you um so you can kind of

378
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
refine what you want like the next stage

379
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,279
in your life to be they talk about like

380
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,279
you don't just have one

381
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,320
career

382
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,200
um

383
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
and that's it uh you can actually choose

384
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
and especially once you get towards mid

385
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
and senior level in your career i think

386
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
you have a lot more choice and a lot

387
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
more flexibility to shift um or to pull

388
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,399
in things that are important or to move

389
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,399
into some of those theoretical areas uh

390
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
that jd mentioned even if it's not a

391
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,079
real job that exists now you have some

392
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,800
power to um advocate for yourself so

393
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
take the time to figure out what you

394
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,880
want to do as well

395
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,639
that advice and becca i think i dropped

396
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,079
the right book links into the summit

397
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,360
discussion channel but you can double

398
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
check bethany we're so glad you could

399
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
join us what are your thoughts on this

400
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
perspective so i think similar to what

401
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,959
you said you know going out and learning

402
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
about different parts of your business

403
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
you know that's identity access

404
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,360
management um i.t strategy marketing you

405
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
know well into the business like

406
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,199
business strategy finance

407
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,959
and so you know if you take that a step

408
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,920
further

409
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
um i think there's some good initial

410
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
conversation in the community about like

411
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,279
should people get mbas um should people

412
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,720
start taking you know short business

413
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,959
classes online like there's a ton of

414
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,519
free or low-cost resources out there

415
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,040
you know just learning the language of

416
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
the business you know to make us more

417
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
relevant to our stakeholders and our

418
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
customers

419
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
um being able to grow

420
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
you know what we do from security you

421
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
know outward across the rest of the

422
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,360
business and then to you know

423
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
person that gives you some pivot you

424
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
know um like rebecca just said are you

425
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,880
doing what you want maybe you want a

426
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
career change and you take what you've

427
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,800
learned from here and you decide well

428
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
now i have

429
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
more job or career freedom because i

430
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
have an mba or i took a class in

431
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,560
automation strategy you know or you know

432
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,680
you've networked into your

433
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,959
organization's i.t strategy um you know

434
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,320
stakeholders

435
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,079
so you know

436
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
the sky is kind of the limit

437
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
um and honestly everything you learn you

438
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,600
still bring back here and it just makes

439
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
you a better

440
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,839
you know cyber intel practitioner

441
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
lillian what do you have to add to this

442
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
a meeting is hard sometimes

443
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,760
ah i feel ya um so a couple of points i

444
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
wanted to chime in something you

445
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,720
mentioned katie um about leadership and

446
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,320
things to do like

447
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,839
once you get higher in levels of

448
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
leadership it's actually more about

449
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
influence and talking to people and less

450
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,240
about maybe some of those tangible um

451
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
like tactical skills and then also to

452
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,199
piggyback on something rebecca just said

453
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,959
one thing that at least has helped me um

454
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
is to think of your career it's not a

455
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,199
career ladder it's a career jungle gym

456
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,639
you're allowed to go sideways you're

457
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,079
allowed to go down you're allowed to go

458
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,079
up you're allowed to go crooked

459
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,480
um it's not a straight path you get to

460
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,320
pick your path and decide how you want

461
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,759
to go there's no prescribed way you have

462
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,920
to really kind of know what you want and

463
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
know what you want to do and know where

464
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
you kind of want to be and sometimes you

465
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,800
know

466
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,519
20 you know 21 year old lillian

467
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,360
did not think she was going to be here

468
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,079
21 year old billion refused to get

469
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,839
married or have kids and i've done both

470
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,240
of those things so like your your your

471
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
goals can change things can happen in

472
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,360
life

473
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,720
um and

474
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
that's just it's about reassessing

475
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
taking a look at yourself and deciding

476
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
what you really want to do and not what

477
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,839
other people have expectations for you

478
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,839
i love that decide what you want for

479
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,639
yourself you set your own expectations

480
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
megan you gave an amazing workshop on

481
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,720
kind of getting into cti but i'm sure

482
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
you have thoughts on advancing as well

483
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
megan what are your thoughts on this i'd

484
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,519
love to hear from you sure thank you

485
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
so i would say the first thing and i

486
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
think this actually applies to anyone is

487
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
any sort of goal that you want to

488
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,639
accomplish you need to map it out so if

489
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,959
you're thinking about things quarterly

490
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,480
you know thinking about what do i want

491
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,079
to get done in quarter one quarter two

492
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,639
quarter three so be really strategic and

493
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,519
map those out incrementally um there's a

494
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
book that both has a book and a workbook

495
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,040
to it um and beck actually mentioned it

496
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,320
in her keynote atomic habits so i do

497
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
actually really recommend that book if

498
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,880
you're trying to think about what goals

499
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,920
you're setting um and working through

500
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
those um the paired workbook i think is

501
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,000
actually quite helpful if you haven't if

502
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
you haven't looked at that before as

503
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,559
well

504
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,679
and then

505
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,480
that is applicable to anyone right

506
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,240
then once you're more advanced in your

507
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,439
career

508
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,400
as we know cyber security is so vast

509
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
threat intelligence even right like you

510
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
can start as a generalist then you need

511
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,000
to decide where you want to go for

512
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
diving deeper

513
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,559
so jd was kind of talking about you know

514
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,559
who in your life has walked different

515
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,640
walks and done different things so

516
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
thinking about what really strikes your

517
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,320
interest and

518
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,120
maybe what people from different fields

519
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,039
have you worked with

520
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,679
and where are you really fascinated with

521
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,799
and or what are you really fascinated in

522
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
and where do you want to go with your

523
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
career and dive deeper and maybe it's a

524
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
sub discipline or field that doesn't

525
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,720
even exist yet and you're actually

526
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,360
pairing a couple things together i i

527
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,520
love intersectionality and kind of

528
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,960
picking at things that are really

529
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
fascinating just to me

530
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,280
and so figure out what is fascinating to

531
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,080
you and where you want to dive deep into

532
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
and i think that's where you're going to

533
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
find your passion and then surround

534
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
yourself with those people who also are

535
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,480
like yeah that's my passion too so if

536
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
you're in that mid or advanced level

537
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,320
it's figuring out where you want to go

538
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,600
deep

539
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,160
i love that negan create some subfield

540
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,000
that no one's thought of like that's

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,039
pretty inspiring go go do it

542
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
grace hopefully you've recovered from

543
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,480
your amazing talk and had a moment to

544
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
breathe

545
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,799
what are your thoughts on this i'd love

546
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,320
to love to hear from you

547
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,919
i was manically reading through the

548
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,280
channels i was like oh wait i'm supposed

549
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,720
to be on now okay i'll look later um so

550
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,640
i think here especially because i come

551
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
from a very different background and i

552
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
still do that weird sub niche that

553
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
doesn't quite exist in any job

554
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,480
description out in the threat intel

555
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
market and landscape

556
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
it's when you're entry level when you're

557
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
trying to get there they don't really

558
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,919
reward being really cross boundary and

559
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,360
doing a lot of different things you kind

560
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
of pick and you start and you build your

561
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
foundations with

562
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,320
a more simple role that's out there like

563
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,160
analysts whatever but that's when you

564
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
also can do volunteering do efforts have

565
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,880
other side hustles or start doing things

566
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
within your organization that move

567
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,120
towards what you want and that's the

568
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,640
thing that you'll be rewarded for over

569
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,000
and over versus being seen as a

570
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
commodity right doing the thing that was

571
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
expected of you only

572
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,679
um in addition to that once you move

573
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,160
into the more mid level what i see with

574
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,799
the teams that we work with is that

575
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,320
when you want to pivot so many people

576
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,679
think about that end goal and it seems

577
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,280
too far but you're building it into

578
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,520
small intermediate steps and you kind of

579
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,679
look at those lateral steps too versus

580
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,840
just trying to throw yourself into that

581
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,520
ultimate goal and that gives you a lot

582
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
of room to play and build off of things

583
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,320
that you might not have already seen

584
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,640
thank you so much grace um i think we've

585
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,080
had a lot of great recommendations on

586
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
this topic so i'd love to move on if you

587
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
have other topics you'd like us to hit

588
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,919
our time is quickly passing for the

589
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,360
panel um but this is one that um came in

590
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,840
that i i think is a good pivot from

591
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,480
grace's talk on information sharing

592
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,159
right someone asked okay what are our

593
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,320
thoughts on getting legal counsels to

594
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,440
get cti to allow that sharing

595
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,120
right you know what we've said in the

596
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,559
last two days

597
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,240
but didn't do information sharing but

598
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
sometimes we might make mistakes tell

599
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,799
people things that aren't true

600
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,240
or are wrong

601
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
there could be real repercussions of

602
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,039
this so i'm curious right legal

603
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
implications of information sharing we

604
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,760
had we had a talk on this a few years

605
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,039
ago i'll see if i can dig up the link

606
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,320
but rick you want to kick us off on this

607
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,080
one

608
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,840
i can't i'll play the the cso role like

609
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,159
i think the cso is a critical partner uh

610
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,960
here especially if you well most

611
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,720
companies or many companies have

612
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
e-commerce and things like that so for

613
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,880
me and my role i i do contract review i

614
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,280
do security addendum reviews i work very

615
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,440
closely so i already have a relationship

616
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,600
with my legal department so i think the

617
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
first thing i would say is and it may be

618
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,799
different in your organization but look

619
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,880
for allies within your business that

620
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,640
already have a relationship

621
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
with legal so you know you're not a

622
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
random coming in saying hey we want to

623
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
 you know the imagine legal like oh

624
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
my god you want to share then you know

625
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,039
the results of an investigation there's

626
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,799
all these sorts of things find out who

627
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,240
has that relationship in the

628
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,440
organization

629
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,679
for for us it would be me and aviva ciso

630
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,360
and i i talked to legal i i mean i'd

631
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
talk to legal on a weekly basis so i

632
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,679
think that's first like everything we've

633
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,360
talked about so much today

634
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,799
grace's talk with networking stuff like

635
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,280
that is get that foundation to have

636
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,799
difficult conversations not because it's

637
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
an unprofessional conversation right but

638
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,840
it could be a difficult conversation for

639
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
the legal team to have to hear so i

640
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,760
think you know i'll i'll let someone

641
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,120
else continue on there but that's my

642
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,280
first one is leverage again i look at my

643
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
notes unknown known right is there

644
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
somebody in your organization that

645
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
already has that relationship that you

646
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,080
can leverage to be your beachhead

647
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
i think that ties into our previous

648
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,679
discussion about the importance of

649
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,679
having those relationships right as a

650
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
leader building those for your team

651
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
lillian do you have thoughts on this

652
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,919
i have many thoughts but i will keep it

653
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
brief um i responded a little bit um in

654
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,799
the chat and one of the things that i

655
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,240
will say is

656
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
the team at yahoo has really interesting

657
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
position because we are a service

658
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,520
provider but yet we're a corporation so

659
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
we actually operate under different

660
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,799
legal regimes um we have a legal regime

661
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,039
where we operate with regards to user

662
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,000
content we control people's content we

663
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
don't own it so the ability to share

664
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
that information is governed by the

665
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
stroke communications act conversely on

666
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,159
our side on the corporate side our

667
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,000
information is governed by cisa which i

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,960
think most

669
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
organizations are which you know you

670
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
have some latitude under the it's the

671
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,799
cyber security information sharing act

672
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,799
not the government organization it's

673
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,320
confusing that their

674
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,000
names the same

675
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
but you do actually have a lot of

676
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,600
latitude um to share information

677
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,200
and again i think we've been hammering

678
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
this point it goes towards influence and

679
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
explaining to your legal counsel hey

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,159
it's important for me to share this

681
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,400
information because it's defensive it's

682
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
defensive for us it'll protect us from

683
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,880
litigation because it shows that we're

684
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
partnering with other organizations to

685
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
protect people or to protect the

686
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,039
industry um things like that it's just

687
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,760
finding those persuasive points um and

688
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,919
also you know again uh being friendly

689
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,960
with their legal counsel um and

690
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,799
other parts of the legal organization

691
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,919
because there's

692
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,799
other aspects um unintended effects that

693
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,400
could um come into play here um so i'll

694
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,919
stop there in case anyone else wants to

695
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,760
chime in

696
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
grace you just posted an awesome

697
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,799
takeaway from your survey do you want to

698
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,320
share that i i'm not going to read it

699
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,039
for you because it's it's your baby

700
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,279
sure yeah i was just go i have all the

701
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
raw notes and it's like 40 pages of

702
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
open-ended responses so thanks again to

703
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
everyone it's a quote from the

704
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
open-ended on what would make most

705
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,200
difference in sharing

706
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
it says when i was working in the cti

707
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
space having the support of leadership

708
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,520
to reach out to other orgs or

709
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
individuals in my network or another's

710
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,120
network would have been the best thing

711
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,400
possible

712
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,240
similarly there's a couple other ones i

713
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,840
just did a keyword search for cso it

714
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,679
says one of them said what worked

715
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,679
arciso's amazing and a part of many

716
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,919
groups he comes back with intel to build

717
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,320
detections off of recently and another

718
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,159
saying share as much as humanly possible

719
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,039
and make sure you have a good

720
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,880
relationship with your cso to get sign

721
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,120
off

722
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
thank you other thoughts on this this is

723
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,240
always a tough one and i did paste that

724
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,720
presentation in from a previous summit

725
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,760
um i think it's a tough one tony yes you

726
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
all do a lot of incident response and

727
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,640
i'm sure you deal with insurance

728
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
companies and lots of lawyers i'd love

729
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
your thoughts on this one yeah so

730
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,559
i've gotten to see this on both sides

731
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,919
private sector and then obviously

732
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,520
consultancy

733
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
private sector where it was literally

734
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,400
standing up this

735
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,400
this module of a career

736
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
a lot of it's a lot of worry uh because

737
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,360
you know to to the point that lillian

738
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
was saying they don't want to air dirty

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,880
laundry and they don't want to make it

740
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
known that something happened

741
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
um

742
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,520
what i have found across the board is

743
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
you have to find

744
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,080
what are tangible metrics

745
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
for them

746
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
if that's money if that's

747
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,880
a specific

748
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
type of threat if it's ransomware if

749
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,400
it's phishing

750
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,760
and you've got to figure out how to

751
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
tailor that

752
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,919
and working with your teams and don't

753
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,400
again it not to keep hitting on even our

754
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
talk but don't silo yourself to think

755
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,400
that it's only you that has to make this

756
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,559
get with other people like hey like i

757
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,720
have to put something together for this

758
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,080
based on

759
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
phishing can you help me with that ir

760
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,960
team can you help that you know i the

761
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,799
sock analyst digital forensics people

762
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,400
with investigations doing you know

763
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
e-discovery and litigation support can

764
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,720
you help me with this and trying to

765
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
build that out

766
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,279
and

767
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,760
i find that lawyers are a lot more

768
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,000
receptive when you come with data

769
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,720
of data for any ask you are coming with

770
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,760
grace did you have something else to

771
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,960
chime in with here before we go to

772
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,600
sherman oh no go ahead sherman cool

773
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,120
sherman go for it love your perspective

774
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
on this too thanks yeah i i straddle in

775
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,760
a very weird spot since i'm uh operating

776
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
under state and local government

777
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,080
so you we're strong a lot of different

778
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,480
sort of entities right both public um

779
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,039
federal public or private entity that

780
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,640
actually you know helps new york city

781
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,799
functions and often time you know i

782
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,279
think one of the hardest challenge

783
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,240
is to sort of convey to our legal

784
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,880
counsel or our sister you know what we

785
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
are actually sharing right like because

786
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
when we say oh we're information or

787
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,520
intelligence sharing they think we're

788
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,760
sharing everything under sun you know

789
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
every every single bit of

790
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
sensitive information about our own you

791
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,120
know internal network and so on so forth

792
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
of course it you know before sharing it

793
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000
to

794
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,919
uh uh partners

795
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,679
most of it will be since you know like

796
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,559
uh

797
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,760
sensitized sanitize sensitize sanitize

798
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,640
so that you know it it will remain under

799
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,159
a certain offset threshold or

800
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,320
operational security threshold um and

801
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
that takes a lot of back and forth to

802
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,320
sort of get get get with and

803
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,120
oftentimes um you know i think we also

804
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,320
need to sort of

805
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,559
first structure out like

806
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,159
the format in which things are being

807
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,440
shared because that's that's the best

808
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,039
way to at least start with some of the

809
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,679
more external uh partnerships that we

810
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,679
have

811
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
thank you sherman um i'd love to move on

812
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,880
to this question that came in from

813
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,679
i think it was alfredo earlier today and

814
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,039
i think it didn't get a lot of attention

815
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,880
but it's a really good one

816
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,000
um yes are there any tips for small cti

817
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,159
teams that have just been created

818
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,799
on what type of intelligence to focus on

819
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,440
right for new teams just starting out

820
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,840
so i'd love to hear from various folks

821
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,520
right what recommendations for teams for

822
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,200
just starting out especially what

823
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,640
product what can they do that's just

824
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,399
like really high impact brian you want

825
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,000
to kick us off

826
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,159
sure i love this topic because when

827
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,320
we're doing working with

828
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,480
teams we often

829
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,559
start out with this and my my first

830
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,799
suggestion is to mine your email

831
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,120
um whoever your primary stakeholder is

832
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,200
your primary intelligence customer you

833
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,919
know usually it's the cso uh just start

834
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
with the last three months or maybe six

835
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,520
months of what are all the things that

836
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,360
they have asked you for in the last six

837
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,720
months that you've actually received

838
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
feedback even if it was just a thumbs up

839
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
or a thanks got it

840
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,600
um and start there and then you can

841
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
develop some generic requirements around

842
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
that and share that with the cso and say

843
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,120
hey these are the things that we provide

844
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,880
you here's what you've asked us for in

845
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
the past what do you think

846
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,600
um

847
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
it's always good to start with what

848
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
you've already been asked for because

849
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,960
there's probably a perception of what

850
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
the intel team does

851
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,760
that may or may not be correct but it's

852
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,840
still there and so tapping into that

853
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,279
saying hey this is what we're doing so

854
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,279
far what do you think what else would

855
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,919
you want um so really just go back and

856
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,159
and mine that primary stakeholders

857
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,760
request because they're going to ask for

858
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,279
something you've done something in the

859
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,159
past

860
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,640
um make that your your standard going

861
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,960
forward and remember it's dynamic what

862
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,399
you're doing today may not be what

863
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,600
you're doing in

864
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,919
three months six months and that's okay

865
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,720
but you definitely want to develop what

866
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,399
ever products you need to develop for

867
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,880
whoever is asking for them

868
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,520
it will change over time for sure um

869
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
o'reilly i'd love to hear from you you

870
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
had such an awesome presentation earlier

871
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,720
right what thoughts do you have on

872
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,399
recommendations for teams just starting

873
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,279
out products what would you tell them

874
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,520
um there's so much information out there

875
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,679
it can get so overwhelming so quickly um

876
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,279
thankfully i had uh i had bethany and

877
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,880
then mike were also very gracious to

878
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,000
help me out

879
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,760
right before i onboarded with cargill

880
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,720
but believe it or not katie your medium

881
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,440
article where it's a self-paced cti

882
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,919
study that thing i reference that thing

883
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,279
so often it's so well put together that

884
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,200
i've used it several times for myself

885
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
and then for friends that are really

886
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,399
curious about getting into the cti field

887
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,000
that i just that's the first thing i

888
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
toss their way because it's just

889
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,600
it's so helpful and it has literally

890
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
every resource you could possibly want

891
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,399
to

892
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,520
dive into

893
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
to just at least get yourself oriented

894
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,279
mentally in that way where you know

895
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,640
you're going to try to figure out

896
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,320
exactly what you want to find what you

897
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,919
want to do

898
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,320
and then linkedin as well like linkedin

899
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,640
i know it had a rough start

900
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
back in like the early 2010s it was kind

901
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,480
of starting to

902
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
form into like a dating app for a little

903
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,440
while so i came off with that but

904
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,600
thankfully you know they they managed to

905
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,120
figure it out and

906
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,039
linkedin has worked really well for me

907
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,080
when right when i finished my degree um

908
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,760
went right back into linkedin and just

909
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,120
started adding people that i thought

910
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,039
might be either looking for

911
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,760
cti analysts um maybe looking for people

912
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
that are willing to take a chance on

913
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
somebody that's brand new into the into

914
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,360
the field um and thankfully that's

915
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,279
precisely how bethany and my leadership

916
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,200
chain found me was on linkedin so don't

917
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
be shy on linkedin definitely share your

918
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
thoughts you know share the articles and

919
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
add some stuff to it

920
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,679
i am terrible about linkedin one of our

921
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,600
sans employees stephen hart calls me out

922
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,960
he's like kate you need to work on your

923
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
profile so

924
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
two people i trust saying that uh i'll

925
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,679
listen

926
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,880
rick what are your thoughts on this

927
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,200
start with your own data i just dropped

928
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,360
into um the slack channel a presentation

929
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,200
from david uh from last year um using

930
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,039
the it actually ties back to what brian

931
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,240
said a little bit you know it was like

932
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,159
look at what the cso's been asking about

933
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,000
for the past three months look at all

934
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,519
the incidents that you've had or the

935
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,159
intrusions that you've had you can use

936
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,519
the

937
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,799
the format

938
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,480
varus format for those that know it to

939
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,320
categorize your own alerts going forward

940
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,679
and then you can start to see trends and

941
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,519
then you can do your own reporting on it

942
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,600
so before you go out and buy a

943
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,440
commercial product from a vendor or

944
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,039
anything like that if you're not you

945
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,720
know mining your own stuff you're gonna

946
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,399
waste your money i don't i would say

947
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,480
you're not mature enough for an external

948
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,559
party you might actually try with your

949
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,320
own stuff and then some open source

950
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
stuff on top maybe use something like

951
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,200
pulse dive actually that's gonna help

952
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
bring in a lot of different sources for

953
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,360
you as well let me talk to to grace

954
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,440
about that particular one but yeah if

955
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,120
you're not doing your own data i would

956
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
contend that you're going to be wasting

957
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,630
your money

958
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,760
[Music]

959
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,240
good advice and that reminds me of a

960
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,919
talk from i think with ryan kovar and

961
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,720
dave harold uh the victory garden a

962
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,480
couple years ago i'll find that one

963
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
because grow your own intel

964
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,240
megan would love your perspective on

965
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,399
this as well yeah very very similar

966
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,159
actually to what rick was saying i was

967
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,679
going to say

968
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,600
know what you have so

969
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,000
um thinking through setting up some

970
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,120
scopes

971
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,240
for

972
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,200
what parameters you want to look at um

973
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,799
and then

974
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,960
setting up your own alerting around you

975
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,679
know what domains you have

976
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,480
what code repositories you have um you

977
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,240
know making sure that you're doing

978
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,320
alerting around different things that

979
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
you have for looking for if there's any

980
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,600
sort of like typo squatting going on

981
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,480
with your own assets

982
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,840
i don't know what type of industry

983
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
they're in

984
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,880
are they in one industry are there other

985
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,559
industry verticals that they need to be

986
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
looking at is their geopole as a

987
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,480
consideration

988
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,159
that they might be needing to pay

989
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,440
attention to

990
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,720
um is there misinformation

991
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,000
disinformation that they need to pay

992
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,440
attention to so there's a lot of

993
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,360
unknowns with that question

994
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,159
um

995
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:30,960
so

996
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,320
it might just be that they're in one

997
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,600
industry it could be that they're in

998
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,120
other industries

999
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,000
um

1000
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,250
so

1001
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,440
[Music]

1002
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,120
there's a lot of

1003
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,360
unknowns to that question

1004
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,880
um

1005
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,600
but depending on that i really do think

1006
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,159
first starting though with

1007
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,480
what you have is gonna be

1008
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,159
most paramount um and then you can do

1009
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,640
some comparative analysis with

1010
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,399
what you're doing within your industry

1011
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,360
and other industry alikes are doing

1012
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,679
and i think that can be really helpful

1013
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,679
to ask around

1014
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,079
another vote for internal analysis i

1015
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,000
love it jd what are your thoughts

1016
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,800
so i take this in two directions the

1017
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,679
most

1018
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,199
small shops

1019
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,639
face a challenge by supporting the

1020
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,719
decision makers above and then some

1021
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,960
level of operational team that's doing

1022
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,480
something with that intel

1023
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,000
on the internal engagement side um

1024
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
from this a senior central intelligence

1025
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,239
agency official once said the core

1026
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,760
product of the intelligence committee is

1027
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,239
not actually an intelligence estimate or

1028
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,000
the president's daily brief it's the

1029
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,679
national intelligence officers that

1030
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,280
deliver those

1031
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,040
and it's focusing particularly on those

1032
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,119
small teams on being that intel officer

1033
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,520
that can oriental and also can engage

1034
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,839
so the the elevator pitch product to the

1035
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,000
senior executives talking about the

1036
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
things that are blowing up in the news

1037
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,400
that they might have heard about

1038
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
enriched with the incidents that are

1039
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920
happening in your organization

1040
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,640
that tied to whatever that wider threat

1041
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,720
perspective is is going to be one of the

1042
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
most valuable things you can do

1043
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,880
day-to-day um when you're very small

1044
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,720
conversely the stand-up

1045
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,560
with the operational teams whether it's

1046
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,040
shift change in a sock whether it's at

1047
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,760
some repetitive delivery cycle that fits

1048
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,839
your schedule for

1049
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,359
um another

1050
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,880
uh organization

1051
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,240
is going to be incredibly important

1052
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,359
because they're going to know what

1053
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,560
they've been dealing with what kind of

1054
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,079
incidents and tickets they've closed

1055
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,280
they're going to know what kind of

1056
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
questions have come in from a fraud team

1057
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,480
they're going to work those problems

1058
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,640
the intel analyst officer is going to be

1059
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
able to bring something to enrich that

1060
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
and going to be able to give a

1061
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,200
perspective perhaps the thing that isn't

1062
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,040
the alligator in front of the boat or

1063
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
the fire they're fighting at that moment

1064
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,960
the thing that the other organizations

1065
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
that are like theirs might be getting

1066
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,040
hit with and it's really honing in on

1067
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,119
that and allowing that to become this

1068
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,680
iterated cycle that then allows you to

1069
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,920
drive towards okay we have a type of

1070
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
current intelligence production we have

1071
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,800
interstellar intelligence production we

1072
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,680
have more strategic focus work and then

1073
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
we have the consumer outcomes meta

1074
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,640
products

1075
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,040
which we don't talk a lot about um the

1076
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,119
idea that you will have a stoplight at

1077
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,200
the end of a month or quarter

1078
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,960
uh product it says okay here are the

1079
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,040
questions that came in here the types of

1080
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
uh issues that we reacted to here's

1081
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,119
where we had knowledge and intel

1082
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,280
advantage here's where we did it

1083
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,359
and why it was a resource issue was a

1084
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,520
collection issue was it a another type

1085
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,720
of problem

1086
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,000
that's how you go from being a small

1087
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,440
team to a team that's appropriately

1088
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,040
sized to the mission that you're trying

1089
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
to solve

1090
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,880
but i'll leave it there thanks jd and

1091
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,720
tony we'll give you a final say on this

1092
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,280
topic before we move on oh joy

1093
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,640
um

1094
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,720
i would say make sure you don't bite off

1095
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,560
more than you could chew

1096
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,119
um i'm just as guilty as anybody i

1097
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,839
remember when i first took

1098
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,359
578 at sands and was like i'm gonna take

1099
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,160
over the cti world at my installation

1100
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
and got there and tried setting

1101
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,520
everything up and i just watched

1102
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,960
saturation kick in and you feel defeated

1103
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,640
you feel burnt out

1104
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,480
and it's like a bottle rocket you're

1105
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,079
going to shoot up in the air and you

1106
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,440
explode and to everybody's point

1107
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,119
it start off small internal and let it

1108
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,599
manifest and leverage your resources and

1109
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,000
your network and your leadership to help

1110
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,079
build out that team i think that that's

1111
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,480
the way to have successful prolonged

1112
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,040
growth of of the department and yourself

1113
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,359
ending on a great note tony no pressure

1114
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,440
at all ending right on a note of

1115
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,520
yourself and your team

1116
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,599
um for our final topic before we start

1117
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,520
to wrap up i wanted to shift to talking

1118
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,000
about the impact of the pandemic we had

1119
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,599
a question come in is one i've heard

1120
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,680
very commonly over the past

1121
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,960
two plus years um been a long two years

1122
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,400
huh

1123
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
how has the pandemic especially affected

1124
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,720
cyber threats and maybe we can shift to

1125
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,400
also cyber threat intelligence in

1126
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,200
general um you know this i first started

1127
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
looking at this

1128
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,760
shortly after the pandemic hit the

1129
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,079
united states and you know what i found

1130
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,640
with this is that right adversaries were

1131
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,960
sort of using the pandemic as a topic

1132
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
for phishing etc

1133
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,280
and otherwise though a lot of like

1134
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,920
malware ttps were the same um one thing

1135
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
i did find though and i think others

1136
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,880
have found this as well so i'd love

1137
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,400
other perspectives on this is that the

1138
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,160
shift to remote work

1139
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,320
actually influenced the attack surface a

1140
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,000
little bit in that i think a lot of

1141
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
networks like vpns other security

1142
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,920
appliances

1143
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,240
were set up pretty quickly facing the

1144
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,680
internet without two-factor

1145
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,040
authentication

1146
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,200
which as we know that's not a great

1147
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,880
security practice and so i think it sort

1148
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,240
of created an opportunity for

1149
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,000
adversaries more than anything so that's

1150
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
my thoughts maybe just a slightly

1151
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,960
different uh attack surface sherman what

1152
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,000
are your thoughts on this one on the

1153
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
pandemic shifts

1154
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
uh i would say there's a major shift to

1155
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,359
at least how

1156
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,160
we operationalize cti for organizations

1157
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,680
have you guys tried doing you know any

1158
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,480
sort of

1159
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,440
roundtable analytical efforts on zoom or

1160
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,720
or you know uh it is a pain um

1161
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,880
especially because normally

1162
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,480
people are usually in a room together

1163
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,520
either are

1164
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,119
shouting each other you know there's a

1165
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,480
lot of talking

1166
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,440
uh it is so much harder to sort of relay

1167
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
all these information

1168
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,920
uh

1169
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,040
within you know sort of a

1170
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,760
telecommunication uh framework so that

1171
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,359
that's a major shift

1172
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,640
um so that

1173
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,200
does cause uh some sort of uh slowdown

1174
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,480
in some of the these uh analytical uh

1175
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,280
sort of products if you will

1176
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,720
other thoughts on this one

1177
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,520
yeah lillian go for it

1178
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,760
uh so i'll comment a little bit on kind

1179
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
of like thread actor side it was kind of

1180
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,560
interesting but you because you could

1181
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,040
kind of tell uh

1182
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,920
where

1183
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,680
covid was

1184
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,400
peaking in ebbing based on certain

1185
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
activity in certain targeting

1186
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
you could tell that it would dovetail

1187
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
with you know some of our adversarial

1188
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,440
countries um so that was really an

1189
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,280
interesting additional piece of

1190
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
attribution that you could use there

1191
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,880
um

1192
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,680
the other thing um to your point is you

1193
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,880
know

1194
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,960
we always want

1195
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,880
to to think that everyone is going to be

1196
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,280
a good person and do the right thing

1197
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,520
but those of us um who have been here

1198
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
for a while and consider ourselves i

1199
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,440
actually jokingly refer to myself as the

1200
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,839
internet janitor know that there's going

1201
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,200
to be other people who are going to come

1202
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,119
and take advantage of this and so there

1203
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,359
is certainly like you eliminated

1204
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,839
a rise in people taking advantage of

1205
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,040
things like

1206
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,280
you know government's releasing pandemic

1207
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,880
money um

1208
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,960
selling you know bunk

1209
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,839
covered cures um you know

1210
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,000
the counterfeit masks and things like

1211
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,119
that so you know bad guys

1212
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,440
i should say bad people malicious actors

1213
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
are good malicious it's just the thing

1214
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,839
that's going to happen and kind of

1215
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:08,640
the

1216
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
it goes back to like the whole crux of

1217
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
cti you have to understand that there

1218
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
are humans behind this not all humans

1219
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,880
are great and so you have to kind of

1220
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
think and figure out how would i explain

1221
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,440
this and then you know how do i counter

1222
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,520
that i think that's kind of how that's

1223
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,920
changed and one just kind of pop shot

1224
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
that i threw into slack is uh working on

1225
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,800
log4j and log forge was amazing remotely

1226
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,200
um i'm sure there are a lot of companies

1227
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
that um

1228
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
kind of wish everyone were in a room

1229
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,560
could order pizza and just just get it

1230
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
done and that just wasn't the case this

1231
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,319
time

1232
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,839
let's uh go to bethany and then

1233
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,079
rebecca so um

1234
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,319
lena yesterday did a really good job of

1235
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,640
being able to take like large-scale

1236
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
strategic geopolitical concepts and then

1237
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
tie them to really specific actors and

1238
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,200
events i mean fantastic

1239
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,599
uh she did so in a way that i haven't

1240
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,240
ever really seen before and um

1241
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,680
i think when we also look at the

1242
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,319
pandemic right similar thing whether

1243
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,240
they're non-state actors like criminal

1244
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
groups you absolutely saw the effect of

1245
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,680
the covet economy and pushing people

1246
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,079
into alternative areas of revenue

1247
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,440
um

1248
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,040
and you know i think that's a larger

1249
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,720
scale picture of how to tie global

1250
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,920
economic

1251
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,960
uh

1252
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,359
issues even like sanctions to

1253
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,480
cyber actors then from the

1254
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,119
state-sponsored side the pandemic just

1255
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,760
accelerated tectonic geopolitical shifts

1256
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,839
that have been in the works for a while

1257
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,400
but it really just accelerated them

1258
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,760
and then you know when you look at

1259
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
nation states like

1260
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,079
china and russia you see some sort of

1261
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,839
divergent actions

1262
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,520
specifically and you know who's willing

1263
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,200
to take ip

1264
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,280
for their own pharmaceutical advantage

1265
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,960
during a pandemic and then those who are

1266
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,640
willing to

1267
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,400
also target ip but also so

1268
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,800
disinformation and i think to you know

1269
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,040
as a community for cyber intel we have

1270
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,560
to learn how to thread that needle of

1271
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
identifying disinformation and where

1272
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,319
that is there isn't like a corporate

1273
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,240
communications issue and how that

1274
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,640
relates to cyber intel so you have all

1275
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,560
like this perfect storm of all these

1276
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,480
geopolitical events happening and

1277
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,119
they're playing out in cyber

1278
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,000
so

1279
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,240
um i think you know the pandemic just

1280
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
accelerated things that were already

1281
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,160
happening and it also revealed things

1282
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,400
that maybe we're not getting priority

1283
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,800
attention previously

1284
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,160
so um

1285
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,839
yeah that's about it

1286
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,520
also really need to plug lena's talk

1287
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,920
again because it was fantastic

1288
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,240
it absolutely was so many amazing talks

1289
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,000
and becca will probably give you a final

1290
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,119
word here

1291
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,560
but luckily i have like a really good

1292
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,720
segue because i was gonna fall you

1293
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,520
always do really great data uh from the

1294
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,839
san cti survey that pascale and i did

1295
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,520
both last year was the first year we

1296
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,359
asked about covet impact and then this

1297
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,760
year we're actually seeing the impacts

1298
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,160
of that on teams and their ability their

1299
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,240
how they're rating their efficiency how

1300
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,040
much cti is helping them um we have a

1301
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,119
webinar coming up february 23rd so i

1302
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,800
will answer this question in much more

1303
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,480
uh depth there

1304
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,960
but my spoiler alert is that

1305
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,040
we have a ton more

1306
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,440
new folks in cti because with the

1307
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,079
expanded threat surface the expanded

1308
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,000
threats and more people going to remote

1309
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,359
work we saw a huge spike in not only

1310
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,000
brand new cti teams but brand new cti

1311
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,760
teams where they are the only analysts

1312
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,400
it is a team of one and i've been there

1313
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,040
um and i know most of us have before so

1314
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,280
if you have people from this summit or

1315
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,800
who you know reaching out to you on

1316
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,280
linkedin um which i hear is a wonderful

1317
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,560
place katie you should spend more time

1318
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,359
there or twitter or slack

1319
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,760
please reach out because we were growing

1320
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,119
as a community

1321
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,960
during a really difficult time for all

1322
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,359
of us
