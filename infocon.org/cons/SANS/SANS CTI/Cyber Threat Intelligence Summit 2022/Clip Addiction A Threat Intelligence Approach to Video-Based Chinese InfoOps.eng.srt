hello everyone uh welcome to join our

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,519
talk about china's information operation

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,400
today i'm going to

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,039
share our threat intelligence approach

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
to study the video based chinese info op

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
and uh we are the cyber threat analyst

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,680
from team d5 it's honor to join with you

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
all again in san cti summit

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
and this year we found that china's

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,440
involved has entered new era

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,239
its new capability has created a new

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,160
challenge

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,440
for all democratic societies and we hope

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
our today's

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,480
topic can

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,079
shed light on this new challenge

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,760
okay ah okay my name is chilton i'm the

research and underground market research

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
and in the past few years i've been the

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,119
invited speaker of many security

conference to talk about china's

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,479
involves

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,479

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,840
a cyberflare analyst in team t5 cti team

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
and my research interest includes osint

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,640
apt information operation and cyber

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
policy in the asia pacific countries

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,720
so

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,759
as mentioned just now i have been in

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,960
last year's cti summit and that is just

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,559
a great experience yeah

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,920
okay

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
oh sorry

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
okay

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
tnt5 is a taiwan-based security company

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,759
we dedicated to study all kinds of cyber

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,880
threats our primary focus is to help our

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,159
clients

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,880
to solve the problem created by

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
apt

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,919
in the past few years we started to use

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,640
cyber intelligence models to

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,599
study the uh this information on social

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,959
media

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,520
we apply the same mindset just like we

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
group the apt malwares we dissect and

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,280
analyze the indicators left from these

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
disinformation campaigns

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
and also intelligence

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,239
about this involved has helped our

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,879
partners to better understand and defend

57
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,200
china's involved

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,518
okay

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,800
okay

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
this is today's online uh we will have

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800
four parts first i will discuss uh why

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
using video in involved is a new trend

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
and we will share our methodologies and

64
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,480
how we adopt a certain intelligence

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,519
framework into our research

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,680
the second part will show four kinds of

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,599
video based involved and their ttps

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,560
we will see how china

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,200
pre-amplifies its preference narratives

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,560
on the chinese video sharing platforms

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,519
and in the third part sylvia will detail

72
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,200
two significant

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,599
video based campaigns one is about

74
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
xinjiang and the other is about hong

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,800
kong

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
she will provide the analyst and how we

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,319
attribute to

78
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
these campaigns to one pro china

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,480
community

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,879
and finally in our conclusion we will

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,239
provide

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,040
the key takeaways for all stakeholders

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,720
in the democratic society

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
okay

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,840
is it

86
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
working

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,159
if you click in uh click in yes sorry

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,200
okay

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
uh

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,159
first of all i want to introduce the

91
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,959
term involved involve is a show from

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,799
information operation

93
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,280
uh it is the i think it is the newest

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,080
topic for cyber security research

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
and it often called

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
influence operation or information

97
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,560
warfare on social media

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
and since 2016 we have been studying

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,519
china's information operation on social

100
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,798
media

101
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,040
and we collect and analyze multiple

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
videos on major

103
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,440
social media platforms used by china's

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,320
state media or those pro-china bond nets

105
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,960
okay

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,520
here's the example china has been

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
amplifying its voice on social media for

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
a long long time

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
and it is getting good at this for

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,479
example you can see

111
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,120
china is accusing the u.s intelligence

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
agency

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
for being the culprit of the 2019 hong

114
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,560
kong protest

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
and in the middle of the slide you can

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
see china's diplomat is amplifying a

117
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,240
conspiracy theory calling the us is

118
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
actually the origin of the kovi 19

119
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
and on the right side you can see a

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,759
typical xinjiang white watching video

121
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
i think the watching video online has

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
become a new chain you can see the

123
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,160
tiktok is the most downloaded app

124
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
and the video on the social media are

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,960
more eye-catching than text or images

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,359
so we have to use our uh

127
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,039
okay is it working yes okay

128
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,680
because i my guy can see my oh okay

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,560
okay we have our methodology is about uh

130
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
is still using the well-known diamond

131
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
model

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,000
and among the four features

133
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
yes among the four features the most

134
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
asked question is the

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
uh how we attribute one campaign a state

136
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
affiliate

137
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
and i think our answer is uh that we

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,800
cannot have uh

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
direct evidence so we divide all the

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,840
actors we categorize all the actors in

141
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,039
the campaign to two kinds of categories

142
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
one is the over actors which means these

143
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
actors can have a direct language to the

144
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
chinese government

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
and the other one is covert actor which

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
they have they don't have a direct

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,759
linkage to the

148
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,319
chinese government but they have a lot

149
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,120
of suspicious indicators and we will

150
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,440
collect these indicators such as the

151
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
timeline content geolocation and

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
to uh

153
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,360
identify these

154
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
actors as

155
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
the have any kind of state sponsor

156
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
possibility

157
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
okay and the another feature was

158
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
mentioned is the capability

159
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,680
capability in the info op is referred as

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
its assets or the artifact owned by the

161
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,599
actors such as the news website content

162
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,880
fund website

163
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,919
social media accounts and hashtags or

164
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,199
even

165
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,599
of course the videos

166
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,680
and based on the capability

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
there's a more detailed framework is

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,720
called

169
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
adversarial misinformation and influence

170
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
tactics and techniques

171
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,319
you can call it emit for short

172
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
this framework is designed by professor

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
sarah jenter

174
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,919
and this framework is based on the

175
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,520
well-known cyber

176
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,639
kill chain

177
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
and it has most important four features

178
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
is planning preparation execution and

179
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
evaluation

180
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
we have used this framework to study all

181
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
our info campaigns

182
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,680
and we will take this

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
our xinjiang and hong kong campaigns

184
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,240
with this framework

185
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,359
okay here's the ttp

186
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,440
to start with this uh china has over 900

187
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,919
million natives and who spend two hours

188
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,800
a day

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
to see the video clips so china has a

190
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,440
show video is leading the show video

191
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,199
content market

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
and

193
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,000
okay

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
and china state media has already done

195
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,319
this change to use video on social media

196
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,440
they refer this strategy as convergence

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,200
media or omni media

198
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,519
based on this strategy people's daily

199
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,640
build a smart media center the board

200
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,958
member has involved the china's telecom

201
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
company and almost all social media

202
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,000
giants

203
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
so

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
on the

205
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,200
china's version tik tok which is doing

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
chinese state media can reach impressive

207
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,480
record on its videos

208
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
on any video they post

209
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,760
you can see a slide here the two largest

210
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,760
state media people's daily and cctv

211
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
all reached 100 million followers as the

212
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,600
most follow account on doing

213
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
their videos can create massive

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
engagements

215
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,680
so without all in mind please notice

216
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,560
that

217
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
inside china these big tech companies

218
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
are standing very closely with the

219
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
chinese government

220
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,480
in our

221
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
observation bdpd which is another video

222
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
sharing platforms in china has a white

223
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
list for the chinese governmental

224
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
accounts

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
meaning that the btbd censorship

226
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,519
mechanism will not be used for the

227
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,040
videos uploaded from the governmental

228
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,399
accounts

229
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,080
and by dance

230
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
provided a supportive plan for the

231
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,000
chinese government

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
the plan is called the local government

233
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
doing growth plan

234
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,920
this plan

235
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,519
can help the

236
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,320
local government to promote their policy

237
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
and propaganda

238
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,880
so

239
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
the chinese government now is having a

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,160
strategy to post everything on weibo

241
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,959
wechat and doing it's called

242
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,959
lianghei ito in chinese

243
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,560
so

244
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
here's the overview about china's video

245
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,320
base involved with emi text

246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,800
we will have a detailed version in

247
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,279
sylvia's talk but in

248
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,760
this overview you can see that these

249
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,560
campaigns have the technique to increase

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,000
massive engagement such as using botnet

251
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
or creating and using hashtags paying

252
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,680
ads or using software in generating

253
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,519
information pollution

254
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
or leveraging legitimate legitimate

255
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
influencer and fabricating social media

256
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
comments

257
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,839
and based on all the videos we collected

258
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,640
we divide our video collection into four

259
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
kind of categories

260
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,640
first one is the we call it new news

261
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
propaganda clips

262
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,279
which are usually made by the state

263
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
media

264
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
the second one is political commentary

265
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
in chinese language

266
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,760
which is made by china's affiliate key

267
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,079
opinion leaders

268
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,560
the third one is the videos made by

269
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
foreign youtubers

270
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,040
and the last one is the low cost videos

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,760
the last one is often used google

272
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
translate voice

273
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
and are spread it by suspicious bar nets

274
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,160
okay here's an example

275
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
the first one is the

276
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
state steam state media made

277
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
video

278
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
this disinformation video is accusing

279
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
the u.s is now creating a riot in

280
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
xinjiang

281
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
you can see the watermark here

282
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
it showed it is added and translated by

283
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,719
china state media basing review

284
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,000
okay

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,760
if you can see the site here of

286
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,240
if you uh one stop one state media

287
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,480
posted and you will found that almost

288
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,959
every chinese government account

289
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,399
will repost this and trying to amplify

290
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,480
this this information video

291
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
okay

292
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,639
the next one is political commentary in

293
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
chinese language

294
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
please notice that

295
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,079
in china those political kls are usually

296
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,959
affiliated with the chinese government

297
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,839
for example the guy on the slide with a

298
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,760
mask

299
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
is actually the editor in global times

300
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,079
which is another state media so

301
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,279
in

302
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,360
in the videos posed by these chinese

303
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
klls uh

304
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
we identify lots of

305
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,600
lots of suspicious youtube bond nets

306
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
will

307
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,040
automatically repost this kind of video

308
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,480
the third one is the videos made by the

309
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
foreign youtubers

310
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,120
the guy on the slide are the most famous

311
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,839
foreign defenders such as beret and

312
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,440
cyrus

313
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
according to the western journalism we

314
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
can link this youtuber to the chinese

315
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
government

316
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
the english newspaper the times has

317
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,519
found that

318
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
the chinese government paid the rate to

319
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,839
produce pro-china propaganda videos

320
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,079
okay

321
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,440
the first one is the low cost news clips

322
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,199
these kind of videos

323
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,680
share similar patterns such as using

324
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,480
google translate voices and spreading

325
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,560
across western social media

326
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
and we have identified lots of low-cost

327
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
videos and they were used to target hong

328
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,440
kong audience

329
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
and this clips has a major thing is that

330
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
they will framing the us for being a

331
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
malicious and

332
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
chaotic country

333
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
the video on the left is accusing the

334
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
u.s for being the corpus behind

335
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,760
kazakhstan's protest

336
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
which has happened recently and the

337
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,959
video on the right side is that saying

338
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,600
the u.s citizen is now living like in

339
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,839
the hell because the u.s government is

340
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,160
failing to handle the kobe 19.

341
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
so in here you can see that this kind of

342
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,519
suspicious videos will are

343
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,040
posted by

344
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
lots of

345
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,360
suspicious facebook fan page or youtube

346
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,079
account at almost the same time and with

347
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
the same text

348
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,920
and their post will have

349
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,680
10 to 30 comments which their comments

350
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,880
are usually copied from the editorial

351
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
uh in the state media

352
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,519
and

353
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
these kind of low-cost news clips will

354
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
be uploaded to almost every

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,720
social media from

356
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,519
twitter youtube or

357
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,639
facebook

358
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,519
and you can see our example here this is

359
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,440
simple is discrediting hong kong pro

360
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,199
democratic academic activities

361
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,839
which you can find it on youtube

362
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,440
and twitter

363
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,040
okay so sylvia

364
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,160
so in the next section i'm going to talk

365
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
about two notable chinese involved in

366
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
social media over the past year

367
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,680
and they are the stops xinjiang rumors

368
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,639
and patriot governing hong kong campaign

369
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,040
so if you have been following china's

370
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,160
influence campaign you would know that

371
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
over the past two years the chinese

372
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,959
propaganda machine has been actively

373
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,240
engaged in proven 19 misinformation so

374
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
one of the recent example is when they

375
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,800
promoted speeches from a swiss biologist

376
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,959
whose existence is later denied by um

377
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,880
the swiss authority

378
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
so um because a lot of reports have been

379
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
published and discussed so today we are

380
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,839
not going to focus on that

381
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,199
part so apart from the covet 19 pandemic

382
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
um the two important issues for chinese

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,199
involved overseas are xinjiang and hong

384
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,839
kong because both of the issues are uh

385
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,880
have always been china's core strategic

386
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,240
interests

387
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,440
and also in recent years um the uyghurs

388
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
human rights abuses and china's

389
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,079
oppression on hong kong protests have

390
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,720
really taken a toll on china's global

391
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,599
image

392
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,839
so by launching the involves across

393
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
social media platforms not only that

394
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
china is trying to shape and influence

395
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,319
international perceptions of

396
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
the two issue but the regime is also

397
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,359
trying to weaken the pro-democracy

398
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,520
movement in hong kong

399
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
because as you know now the hong kong

400
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,160
people still have access to foreign

401
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,480
social media platforms like facebook and

402
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,520
youtube

403
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
and the chinese authority are really

404
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
eager to influence the hong kong public

405
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
opinion especially

406
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
targeting those young generation

407
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
but one thing is that china is facing

408
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
challenges in its overseas campaign and

409
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,799
one of the most crucial challenges is

410
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,160
that it get it gets no robust support

411
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,039
from the foreign social media giant in

412
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,440
terms of censorship and content

413
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
promotion

414
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
so as

415
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,640
watcher presented just now

416
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
the chinese authority often gets

417
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
supports and even by force

418
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,200
by forcing the cooperation from

419
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
by dance wechat and weight ball but this

420
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,120
is not what they get on foreign

421
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,678
platforms

422
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,039
so first we look at the stop xinjiang

423
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,640
rumors campaign

424
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
china has invested tons of efforts and

425
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,880
resources in promoting an alternative

426
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,039
narrative of the xinjiang human rights

427
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,320
abuses

428
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,760
so previously the australian think tank

429
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,640
the aspi has actually pinned down a

430
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,919
chinese marketing firm that operates one

431
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
of the youtube channels and further

432
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,039
analysis showed that the company is

433
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,480
linked to the xinjiang government

434
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
so

435
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
today we are going to look at

436
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,160
the videos and we found that there are

437
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,799
social media accounts dedicated in

438
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,679
promoting um the hashtag along with the

439
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,720
videos

440
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,679
and we have identified over 20 youtube

441
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,240
channels participating in this campaign

442
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
and over 180 videos being uploaded on

443
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,919
youtube

444
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,280
so the campaign was first seen in 2020

445
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
and it is ongoing

446
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
so in the following slides i will share

447
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,919
some some of the ttps and mark them with

448
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,679
tags in the admit framework

449
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,440
next slide please

450
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
so in this campaign the actors

451
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
extensively use this hashtag and all of

452
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
the videos promoting this hashtag are

453
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,080
subtitled in both chinese and english

454
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
language

455
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,520
indicating that they are targeting

456
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
chinese and english audiences

457
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
and this video would feature uyghurs

458
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
speaking in chinese and the uyghurs

459
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
they will emphasize the real life in

460
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,159
xinjiang and how grateful they are to

461
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,039
the govern of ccp

462
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,600
so although the individuals that appear

463
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
in the videos are different and there

464
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,880
are no

465
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
connection between this channel

466
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
but those video the narrative the

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
structure and the subtitle format are

468
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,200
highly identical

469
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,520
so from our observation we have seen

470
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
youtube constantly removing this kind of

471
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,799
bot channel from time to time but even

472
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,960
after some channels were banned we

473
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,200
continue to see similar channels and

474
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,919
accounts being established and continue

475
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,080
to spread similar content on a daily

476
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,559
basis

477
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,880
next slide yes so apart from the videos

478
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,120
featuring uyghurs we found that their

479
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,679
foreign influencer participated in this

480
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,440
campaign

481
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,960
so um from the news web website um the

482
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,360
only news website of xinjiang called

483
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,159
tian shan net kim sheng wang

484
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
the new site actually promoted the

485
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,280
interview videos of two foreigners and

486
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,360
one of the foreigners is noely as

487
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,000
an

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,240
internet celebrity a youtuber from

489
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,600
singapore

490
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
so like we mentioned before now that

491
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,240
this state media they like to leverage

492
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,039
foreign voices or foreign faces

493
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,799
especially those from the

494
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,760
english-speaking countries to fight back

495
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,640
against the investigation report made by

496
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
western media

497
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
so we can confirm whether this

498
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,120
influencer are hired by the chinese

499
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,480
authorities or not but in last july bbc

500
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
cited multiple sources at cgtn and they

501
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,080
reported that there are some cgtn

502
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
departments were instructed to find

503
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,840
foreigner and influencer and send them

504
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
to xinjiang to film videos

505
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,280
in

506
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,960
representing china's views

507
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,080
so as you can see noely himself is a

508
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,640
youtuber with over 13 000 followers so

509
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
although that is not a big number but he

510
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,960
has posted about 15 videos on xinjiang

511
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,640
with a pro ccp perspective so one of his

512
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,159
xinjiang video has hit over 120

513
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,880
000 views

514
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
and this interview videos were also

515
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,480
amplified by bot accounts on twitter and

516
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,799
you can even observe observe a weird

517
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,200
code following the caption in the tweets

518
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,679
indicating that the tweets are highly

519
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,120
possible operated by a mass management

520
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,320
system which allows users to batch

521
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,559
manage thousands of social media

522
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,919
accounts at once

523
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,120
so here is also the screenshot of

524
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,199
the promotion of another video

525
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,440
and we also discovered the japanese

526
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,840
version of this hashtag being amplified

527
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,880
on twitter

528
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,679
as

529
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,960
we can see

530
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
this hashtag

531
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,760
which translated into english is uyghur

532
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,039
genocide is a hoax

533
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,120
and to increase the exposure and the

534
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,600
organic engagement of the tweets this

535
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,080
twitter account will also leverage and

536
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
hijack other popular hashtag at the

537
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,799
moment so for example during the

538
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
mother's day in last may we can see that

539
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,640
this

540
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,039
twitter accounts have posted videos a

541
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
company with both genocide is a hoax as

542
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,039
well as the mother's day

543
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,600
hashtag

544
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,279
so apart from those videos featuring

545
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,080
uyghurs and influencer we also see

546
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,279
low-cost news clip in this campaign if

547
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,559
you remember

548
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,799
they are what chur mentioned in his

549
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,159
slide as the fourth type of the video so

550
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,159
this kind of video they are composed of

551
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,480
news clip and script written by state

552
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,279
media editorial and most of the videos

553
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,840
are narrated by automated dubbing

554
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,279
service

555
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,480
so

556
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,200
in the xinjiang campaign this video they

557
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
would accuse the u.s for spreading lies

558
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,640
about xinjiang in the name of human

559
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,679
rights

560
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,919
again we can see networks of bots

561
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,080
flooding youtube twitter and facebook

562
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,640
group with these videos

563
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,559
and these channels and account they tend

564
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,679
to use english name and we access that

565
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,480
this is possibly um one to describe

566
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,840
themselves as foreigners

567
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
so in the comments section you can also

568
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,520
see the comment box posting um

569
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,880
fake comments and hate speech to support

570
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
china's narrative

571
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,480
next slide

572
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
so what is most

573
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,640
noteworthy is that the videos

574
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,240
dissemination has evolved from the pure

575
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,520
machine driven flooding to organic real

576
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,760
users engagement

577
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
so because the above mentioned videos

578
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,000
they are not only disseminated and

579
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,960
amplified by bots only because now some

580
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,760
chinese diplomats the wolf warriors have

581
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
started to promote this kind of videos

582
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,039
too

583
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,120
so chinese diplomat social media

584
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
accounts typically

585
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,360
the follower ranges from hundreds to

586
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,159
thousands but as we know one of the most

587
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,679
famous wolf warrior jiao li jian he his

588
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,000
twitter accounts has already hit 1

589
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,120
million followers on twitter so um the

590
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
engagement of the video can get really

591
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,240
high

592
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
so next we are going to look at video

593
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,880
based involved targeting hong kong so we

594
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
noticed that um

595
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
after the outbreak of the protests the

596
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,480
chinese state media they started to

597
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,799
establish their official accounts on

598
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
facebook

599
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,880
next slide

600
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
and then we see that this official

601
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,440
accounts and also the bondnet has

602
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
started to promote a hashtag called

603
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,600
patriot governing hong kong

604
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,559
and this basically means that only

605
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,120
pro-china and pro-ccp candidate are

606
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,360
allowed to participate in hong kong

607
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,880
election

608
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
so

609
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,039
again low-cost video are observed in

610
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,480
this campaign

611
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,960
so background information this kind of

612
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,000
video

613
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,159
from what we observed it first appeared

614
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,080
in 2019

615
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
and they have been seen in various kind

616
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
of campaigns including the ones that

617
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,279
attack chinese businessman guo

618
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,000
for example graphica has published a

619
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,039
series of reports on this kind of

620
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,600
videos and bot network

621
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,640
so

622
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,960
our finding is that we observe like in

623
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
the xinjiang campaign

624
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
this low-cost video they actually have

625
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,159
organic engagement and exposure

626
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,720
because they are published and shared by

627
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
pro-china political figures and those

628
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,840
online influencers in hong kong

629
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,000
so from the screenshot you can see the

630
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,039
example of the low-cost video that is

631
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,640
used to

632
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,760
attack sometimes the u.s sometimes the

633
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,960
pro-democracy campaign in hong kong

634
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,159
and

635
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,200
this is

636
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
a hong kong politician

637
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,399
and then

638
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,000
we can see that

639
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,880
the identical videos were simultaneously

640
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,960
uploaded by the bot network and also

641
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
this real user

642
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,039
and the next slide

643
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,440
you can notice you can also notice that

644
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
this pro-china hong kong political

645
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,039
figures they often have over 10 000

646
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,080
followers on youtube and usually their

647
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,960
channel will share organic and authentic

648
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,679
videos made by themselves but from time

649
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,799
to time um it's very weird but they also

650
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,520
uploaded this kind of auto-generated

651
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,360
videos that promote the patriot

652
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,959
governing hong kong hashtag

653
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,960
next slide

654
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,120
so we found that one of the hong kong

655
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
politician that helped promoting this

656
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,559
video on youtube

657
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,240
is a member of the cppcc

658
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,919
herbe committee so what is

659
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,520
cppcc this is actually

660
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
a central part of the chinese communist

661
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,039
party united front system so it is part

662
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,919
of the propaganda machine

663
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,320
so take this one video for example so

664
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,399
this video it attacks the hong kong

665
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,760
alliance which is a pro-democracy organ

666
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,720
organization in hong kong so we found

667
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,880
that this single video has been

668
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,520
amplified by two political figures

669
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,399
three online influencer four youtube

670
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,479
channels and four facebook pages

671
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,080
so here's a screenshot of how they

672
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,120
upload

673
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,399
the videos

674
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,240
within a very short period of time

675
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,120
and the next slide and again the comment

676
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
section of this spot channels is being

677
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,200
flooded by the common bots

678
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,559
so this is a facebook page called the

679
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,520
rumor debunker it is one of the facebook

680
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,080
pages that is actively promoting this

681
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,799
low cost video so according to facebook

682
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,760
page transparency it has paid ads about

683
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,480
social issue election and politics

684
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,279
so of all the con content of this page

685
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,760
is mainly in chinese language it shows

686
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,080
that the admins are located in france

687
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,880
u.s and south africa so we don't know

688
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,640
how facebook identify admit location but

689
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,720
this indicates that the actor might be

690
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,279
using a vpn service to hide their real

691
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,279
location

692
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,480
so in summary back to this emit

693
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
framework so by using the framework we

694
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
can see that so far china's video based

695
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,640
campaigns are using similar technique to

696
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
increase the exposure and real user

697
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,640
engagement of their propaganda videos so

698
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,799
the tactics include the bot accounts

699
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,919
channel hashtag ads flooding

700
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,159
using influencer

701
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,679
and maybe some of you may know this that

702
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,480
i think some of the ttp is actually miss

703
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,120
out in this framework so for example

704
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,039
those low-cost news clip which has

705
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,840
just appeared in the recent years

706
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,880
or

707
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,000
how the real world political figures

708
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,080
has participated in the campaign of this

709
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,679
automated

710
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
bot channel to increase the exposure of

711
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,320
the videos

712
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,640
but nevertheless above all i still think

713
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,360
this is a very good um framework for us

714
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,840
to discuss and analyze this information

715
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
in info ops this make us can investigate

716
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,200
it like how we investigate apt campaigns

717
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,440
so last year

718
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,679
we have talked about how the actors can

719
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,080
evolve and change their ttps

720
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,320
by using this framework it could be more

721
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,919
efficient for researchers and

722
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,159
stakeholders to describe and understand

723
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,320
the incident

724
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,200
so

725
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,679
another important question is that who

726
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,000
is making this video because they look

727
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,480
alike they have same narrative and sent

728
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,279
same template so we found some clues in

729
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,399
the videos as there are watermarks can

730
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,559
be seen in several

731
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,360
videos in this campaign

732
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,840
next one

733
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,799
so as you can see in this conspiracy

734
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,840
video about the u.s fort detrick there's

735
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,559
a watermarks of sparks at the corner

736
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,840
we found that this logo actually belongs

737
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,639
to a chinese patriotic forum called

738
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,080
which can be translated to a crimson

739
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,919
patriotic league

740
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,880
so we access that this forum could be

741
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
one of the actors responsible for the

742
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,240
production of this low-cost propaganda

743
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,600
and disinformation videos

744
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,919
we also found that this patriotically

745
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,799
has official page and accounts on

746
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,279
facebook and youtube and their twitter

747
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,600
followers have reached over fifteen

748
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,080
thousand

749
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,519
so um this is the final section outlook

750
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,399
and conclusion

751
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,080
next slide

752
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,640
so what is neck for china's involves as

753
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,039
you can see currently china's video

754
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,440
based operation are using software to

755
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
generate hundreds and thousands of

756
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,640
videos that could be batch uploaded into

757
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,440
cyberspace every day but at the same

758
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
time we access that the impact of this

759
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
low-cost video is limited

760
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,519
but in the future the application of

761
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,399
advanced artificial intelligence could

762
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,519
improve the production of this

763
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,039
auto-generated videos in terms of

764
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,840
quality and quantity so the video

765
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,760
production could be faster more

766
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,120
sophisticated and more believable

767
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,440
and it is also possible we will also see

768
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,519
more and more foreign influencers around

769
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,399
the world participate in this campaign

770
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,320
and they could be either driven by

771
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,120
financial motives or it is also possible

772
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,039
they genuinely believe

773
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,600
the narrative created and promoted by

774
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,399
the chinese authority

775
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,039
so the next slide

776
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,960
so as for the governments around the

777
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,679
world this kind of information pollution

778
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,360
is posing threats to democratic society

779
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,039
in order to fight back this

780
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,080
state-sponsored info transparency is key

781
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,159
so transparent communicate we believe

782
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,399
transparent communication could help in

783
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,519
building trust in public institution and

784
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,000
provide better environment for

785
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,640
discussion

786
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
and as for the fact centers and social

787
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,079
media firm we have to acknowledge that

788
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,918
the fact checkers around the world are

789
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,800
facing challenges because those myriads

790
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,918
of video could paralyze this centers and

791
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,320
the content supervision team and the

792
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,480
fact checking is actually a complex

793
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,719
issue and it could lead to more disputes

794
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
and arguments

795
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,719
and another important thing is that so

796
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,639
far the automatic solution for

797
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,679
disinformation detection especially in

798
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,320
identifying this information in video

799
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
format and is still in its early stages

800
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,520
and this problem is slowly emerging as

801
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,679
we know that last year the facebook

802
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,320
visual blower exposed that facebook

803
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
algorithm could amplify misinformation

804
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
and the algorithm was exploited by

805
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,918
foreign adversary

806
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,960
and also according to internal documents

807
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,160
facebook ai cannot detect hate speech or

808
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,480
violence consistently

809
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,680
so

810
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,040
if this algorithm can't even detect

811
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,000
hate speech in english precisely not to

812
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,599
mention other languages like chinese

813
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,599
so collaboration with third-party

814
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,640
researcher and organization has becoming

815
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,040
exceptionally important at the moment

816
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,839
across this disciplinary study

817
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,760
approaches for example

818
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,520
the approach of threat intelligence

819
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,160
mindset could be effective in

820
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,520
identifying future and emerging threats

821
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,599
so that is that is all for our

822
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,240
presentation thank you all for tuning in

823
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
i hope it is

824
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,839
for provoking thank you
