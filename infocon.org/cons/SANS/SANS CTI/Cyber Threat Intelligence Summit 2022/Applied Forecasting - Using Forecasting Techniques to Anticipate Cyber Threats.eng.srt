1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,440
all right folks uh

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,480
welcome today um i'll be your

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,080
cyber weatherman for uh january 27th

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
2022 on this awesome summit uh we

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
already had the great keynote by rebecca

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,560
thanks as well rebecca it was awesome um

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,400
today i'm going to talk a bit about

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,560
forecasting and how does that apply in

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,359
the private sector

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,079
now usually uh people think that

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
forecasting is some abstract uh art

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,040
and in in reality it's not really that

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,280
right um the reality is that it's

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,640
actually something that is a practice

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
and something you can actually do and

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
what a cti analyst does is they don't

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,079
predict they actually forecast

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,320
somebody told that a few summits ago

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,199
right

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,800
um and

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,600
what this actually provides for you as a

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
company or as a person is that it allows

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,840
you to actually have some foresight into

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
your strategic planning process

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
and to give an example of that i'd like

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
to highlight some research by paul kobie

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,840
and mariam

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,119
where they actually

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,280
gave an example of a company who by

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,119
using these intelligence analysis

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,680
techniques who they used actually to

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
prepare themselves accordingly for the

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
beginning phases of the of the of the of

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
the pandemic i would actually allowed

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,439
them to do is they actually saved a lot

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,680
of costs in the process

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
now basically in the weather analogy you

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
know um when with a certain forecast you

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
would know what to wear

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
and in business we actually use that

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
understanding from certain futures

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
to actually prepare ourselves

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
accordingly to that

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,119
now i'm uh

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,840
give it a short tldr i'm a security

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
professional who is actually passionate

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,840
about looking at the big picture i want

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
to understand how the big picture works

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,759
and then how we can dive into each

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,600
individual topics

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,759
and and i also think it's very important

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
to share knowledge and expertise

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
and i'm also more than happy and really

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
thrilled that i see a lot of new

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
speakers for the next two days in the

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
conference i really encourage everyone

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,319
to actually

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
sign up for these as well it's really

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
awesome and i'd love to hear all of your

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,959
thoughts

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
but i actually that being said i

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
actually don't have a background within

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
the intelligence community i

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
unlike other people you see in these

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
summits in this summit specifically i

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,400
consider myself a practitioner who uses

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,360
intelligence techniques cti techniques

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,959
and actually make that work in the

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,480
private sector

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,840
that's what i'm good at that's what i

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
love to do so i'll keep doing that

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
so i basically structured my talk about

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
three things so first i'd like to

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,400
give a few basics if you will on how you

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
use forecasting in the private sector

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,239
second i'll be diving into what value it

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,879
actually adds and thirdly if you're

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,480
really up for that you know what are

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
some of the building blocks you need to

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,959
actually do this

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
let's start uh with uh some concepts uh

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
to to get the the juices flowing in

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,400
people

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,200
um obviously there's prediction right

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,920
and forecasting is actually a sub

86
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
element of prediction

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,959
prediction is basically having a

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,879
possible outcome and actually figuring

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
out what that is and forecasting

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
includes current and historic

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,560
information to actually give you more

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,799
insight into what could happen

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
usually being

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
apologies more accurate

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
now there's also the concept of super

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,239
forecasting and super forecasting

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,560
basically is have a bunch of people do

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
forecasts and analyze the forecasts and

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
analyze the forecasters that's really

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,879
awesome

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
there's a book

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,720
on that by philippe tedlock and it

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
basically emphasizes

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
their research in the so-called good

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,799
judgment project and a fun anecdote of

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,720
that research is that the average

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,920
forecast

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,319
done is no different than a completely

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
random thing and they

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,000
compare that to a dark throwing gym

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
now finally i'd like to highlight the

112
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,560
concept also sometimes referenced as now

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,798
casting and now casting basically looks

114
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,160
at the current

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,120
or

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
very close future

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
uh and and the cyber fields we sometimes

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,639
call this

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,520
dashboarding for example right

120
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
so these are a couple of of basics we

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
really need to understand now the second

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
thing we need to understand is who

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
actually does this right

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,320
so we we all have that that uncle or

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
aunt that's in the christmas period had

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
a lot of crazy ideas about what's going

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
to happen in the near future

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
however i generally think that there is

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
no one type of group or anything that

130
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
does this kind of work

131
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,600
i generally think that there are two use

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
cases people try to explore when doing

133
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,520
forecasting which is basically the

134
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,000
manual effort or the automated effort

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,639
let's dive into that one a bit further

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,680
and using an example so if we would have

137
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,400
a coin toss game and in that coin toss

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
game we would have people predict or

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
forecast forecast

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
what it will be if the coin is flipped

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
heads or tails

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,400
now what you will see

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,080
and there's actually also example from

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
the super forecasting book is that

145
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
a few people do it really badly and a

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
few people do really well but the

147
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
majority actually is is is 50 50.

148
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
and it basically creates a normal

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
distribution

150
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
and what it actually is you know you

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
think maybe you know this is a coin toss

152
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
game this could be luck

153
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,919
but the reality is is that

154
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,840
in the private sector it is actually a

155
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,639
skill you can hone and work on and that

156
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
allows you to then move more to the

157
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,600
right and more to the very good caster

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,919
area

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,160
so you have actually two main types

160
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
qualitative and quantitative

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,919
quantitative breaks down into time

162
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,000
series analysis and projection and

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
causal models

164
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,600
the time series analysis and projection

165
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
is basically full of data and the

166
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
charting we all know and love right

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,319
and the cause of more loss actually is

168
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,039
the same thing except underneath there

169
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,319
are certain relationships noted

170
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,639
this basically allows them to predict

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
when something will happen like rain is

172
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
going to fall if that happens if the

173
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,039
cloud is coming here

174
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,880
now finally you have the qualitative

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,759
aspect focusing on the human judgment on

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,639
that

177
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
and this is regularly used if you don't

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
have sufficient data or if you for

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
example need to

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,759
fill in some gaps

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,759
um

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,560
so

183
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
let me now also so you now got got the

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,479
gist of it right um and now let me also

185
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
dive a bit deeper into this topic and

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,560
actually see you know what actually is

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
useful in the private sector

188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
as you can see on this this visual is

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,199
that

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
you can see the three types

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
i defined but you can also already

192
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,400
notice that the more on the right is

193
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
actually more technically oriented

194
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
whereas on the left it's more people

195
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,479
oriented

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
um i generally think that that

197
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
i obviously have an opinion on that and

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
my practical take is actually that a lot

199
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
of people want to have the more

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,759
technologically oriented solution

201
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,599
but the reality is it comes with some

202
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,440
challenges you need to have your data

203
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
correctly clean data relationships

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,080
defined

205
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
that's a lot of work right

206
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,400
and

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
what i generally see

208
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,879
in real life is that

209
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,360
basically the best results i get is from

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,759
using a qualitative approach

211
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,720
and then combine that support that with

212
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,919
certain

213
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,639
techniques from time series and analysis

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,960
based on the data you might have

215
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
so let's explore that best value thing a

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
bit further

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
now beck's already mentioned a bit on

218
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,639
structured analytical techniques

219
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
and i want to highlight this as well and

220
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
and this uh

221
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,800
the idea of of of this is basically a

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,440
de-biasing technique that can help an

223
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,840
analyst provide more options to what

224
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,680
they're doing

225
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,400
it is the super juror of intelligence

226
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
analysts

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
and they do this every day and in

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,760
general uh i think

229
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,640
these are still in private sector

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,320
and not used very often

231
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
um you basically can group them on the

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
purpose or if you're pure several others

233
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,680
categories uh diagnostic being uh

234
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,959
obviously looking at the current

235
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,519
situation making analytical arguments

236
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,040
contrarian

237
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,560
thinking would be a challenging the

238
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,040
current thinking and imaginative would

239
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,399
look into

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,680
for example developing new insights

241
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
my key takeaway here is that you should

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
not basically think of this as the

243
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,519
go-to-way but there's a lot of

244
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,080
fundamental logic behind this and that's

245
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
why i always use these as a sort of like

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,959
a spirit guide or a toolbox which i then

247
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,440
look into and then think you know i'll

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,240
grab the book here and think okay i'll

249
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
use this workflow to determine what use

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
case i have and then also think about

251
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,360
how i actually need to use it right

252
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,880
that's what everyone always thinks about

253
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
now that being said

254
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
i would also like to emphasize how you

255
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
use this so here you see a 10-step

256
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
guide on how you can use one of these

257
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
techniques and i specifically

258
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
highlighted the scenario planning one

259
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
i'm not going to go through each and

260
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,160
every one of these we don't have that

261
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
much time and but i would like to high

262
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
so i really like would like to recommend

263
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
all of you to actually look at this

264
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,800
slide tomorrow again and think hey this

265
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
is something useful for me i can use

266
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
this yes or no i'd like to highlight

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
three things the first one is is that

268
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,560
using the technique as is is definitely

269
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,399
not the purpose it's also about the

270
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,920
process

271
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
when you actually do this periodically

272
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,120
it will actually help you in the whole

273
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
it will actually help the whole company

274
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,959
and why is that because people will

275
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
recognize that you do these kind of

276
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,640
exercises that you will actually have

277
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
something to show for

278
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
second is the analysis in this

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,279
particular example you see that there's

280
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
actually a lot of work being done to

281
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
understand on a very granular level what

282
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,040
is going on so that is also needed

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,680
and finally you have a the end product

284
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
and that's sometimes also underestimated

285
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
what should the end product look like

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,680
but also

287
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
how can you make the end product

288
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
relatable for different members in the

289
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
team

290
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,959
that is something i'll get back on later

291
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,920
in this presentation

292
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,959
so you just saw an example how you do

293
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,800
the full process right

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
um but in that process there's the

295
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
analytical steps

296
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
and after you've done that you actually

297
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,160
your conclusion actually allows you to

298
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
make assessments

299
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,000
and these assessments are really useful

300
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
in forecasting because they substantiate

301
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
the uncertainty

302
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
and what i mean by that is that they

303
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
allow you to have a better understanding

304
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,360
of what's going on or what's what do you

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,600
think that will happen

306
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
in the context of forecasting i would

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
like to emphasize one thing i found

308
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
really useful and that is moving

309
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
assessments upwards

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
and what that what i mean by that is

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,519
that you actually have a certain

312
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
situation and you see the key takeaways

313
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,600
from that and if you monitor that on a

314
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
monthly and quarterly basis you can

315
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,399
actually see a flow of events happening

316
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,760
and create some sort of better

317
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
understanding of you

318
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,519
and to give an example on that

319
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,480
in

320
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
q4 21 we actually saw certain

321
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
infrastructure providers having some

322
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,440
downtime right

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
but in the end

324
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
from a daily basis people ask me like

325
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
why is this relevant but then when we

326
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
started tracking that and on a monthly

327
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
basis we saw that this wasn't the first

328
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
time it happened and you know it

329
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
continued to happen

330
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
and then a quarterly basis we were

331
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,480
actually able to say like

332
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
this is something there's there must be

333
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
something going on because this can't

334
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,439
all be the intern right

335
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,760
so another thing that's quite relevant

336
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,240
is and you don't see often is looking at

337
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
the meta and i don't mean the zuckerberg

338
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
facebook policy of rebranding i'm

339
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,399
talking about comparing comparative

340
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,959
research and thinking about okay how can

341
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,519
we overlap certain researchers how can

342
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,240
we combine them or not

343
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
and this is really useful if you don't

344
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,040
have that much time to do analysis and

345
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
actually allow you to seek out certain

346
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,000
vendors or individuals who do that it

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,760
allows you to actually spot pros and

348
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
cons and publishers who may be really

349
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
good at that and that can support your

350
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,279
source and collection management if

351
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
you're doing that exactly

352
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,160
also the nature of that type of research

353
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
allows you to identify trends

354
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,440
because it's comparative by nature

355
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
finally you also will see different

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,160
things overlapping and that's useful for

357
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,120
improving the structure of your

358
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
deliverables

359
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
i'm going to seamlessly plug a talk i

360
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
gave last year where i actually looked

361
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,519
at

362
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
what were the threat predictions in 2 in

363
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,760
2021

364
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,959
and actually

365
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,399
at the middle of the year what actually

366
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,040
turned out and how i predicted or

367
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,120
forecasted that to happen in the in the

368
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,399
near future

369
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,519
and

370
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,519
it's interesting for those of you who

371
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,199
are into this topic if you're interested

372
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,480
in that have a look at that

373
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,800
so now we get into the the big elephant

374
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,279
in the room right

375
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,440
the reality is is that forecasting does

376
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
take people and these people need to

377
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
have a certain skill so they probably

378
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
also need some sort of training right

379
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
and it actually takes some time to do

380
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,440
this correctly

381
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
and finally you might not even like the

382
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,839
conclusions

383
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,760
or find them valuable

384
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
and this could be that you don't think

385
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
it's accurate enough right

386
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,800
but the reality is that forecasting you

387
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120
use to actually develop certain options

388
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
for you and think about those options

389
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
and allow you to actually prepare and

390
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,160
work on that

391
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,240
now despite despite the obvious

392
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,639
there are real no real shortcuts on that

393
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,560
and there are no real things you can do

394
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
quickly

395
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
so give me a second

396
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
so this this morning i had the idea the

397
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,800
weather is fine but the reality was is

398
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
that it's netherlands and it was raining

399
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,230
so that forecast was a bit off

400
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,079
[Music]

401
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,839
but to prepare your team actually on

402
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,839
doing forecasting there's a couple of

403
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,600
things they can actually do

404
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,279
right now and i'm going to talk to that

405
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,639
uh on that in a second so the first

406
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,240
thing you would really need is to

407
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
actually align on risk management some

408
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,639
of you might think ah risk management

409
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,760
again

410
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,199
i actually find that this is an

411
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,920
important step to begin with

412
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,160
and why to be honest because this is

413
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,680
basically where we make the conscious

414
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,600
decision to do something about something

415
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
that being said um i also believe that

416
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,360
forecasting is a decision uh is a risk

417
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
management decision right and it doesn't

418
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,000
matter what equation you use it matters

419
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,519
that you have to have an understanding

420
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,240
of certain uh elements and there's a

421
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
link for for example for certified

422
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,839
intelligence which i believe is in the

423
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,839
capability intent and opportunity

424
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,160
domain and one things i usually do when

425
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
i'm having these discussions i try to

426
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,920
find a common ground

427
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
with people and actually for example try

428
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
to align with risk management teams on

429
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,160
their data level this could be mitres

430
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,839
attack could be something completely

431
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
different

432
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,360
the second building block you need is

433
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,519
talking a common language and more

434
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,480
importantly being able to to

435
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,680
nuance or or be more granular

436
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
in the language you talk

437
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,279
that's probably early in the conference

438
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,959
so for those of you who are using the

439
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
bingo cards check it off

440
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,600
um right because this one is on probably

441
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
on there but what i generally found is

442
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,839
that you need to establish some sort of

443
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,880
ladder

444
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,440
of how you frame your story

445
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,079
so i always expand the pyramid with the

446
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,000
the narrative of that there are certain

447
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
groups that are influenced by a certain

448
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,000
motivation they

449
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,680
perform certain campaigns and each

450
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,320
campaign can have certain

451
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,360
dtps and observables

452
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,759
what is important is that you have a

453
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,360
conversation with your teams to

454
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
understand what kind of tangible content

455
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,920
do they need or maybe they actually need

456
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,240
some of the more

457
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,560
floppy content basically

458
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
and the second thing this also allows me

459
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
to then work on integrating capability

460
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
in intent

461
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
a small disclaimer there obviously if

462
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,799
you don't have a big intelligence

463
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,919
capability then working on intent is

464
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,559
very hard and i would even say that in

465
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,319
the private sector it's near impossible

466
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
to have you know high confidence

467
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,640
assessments on intent i think that's

468
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
nearly impossible but it does help you

469
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
both of these all of these elements are

470
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,079
allow you to ask better questions

471
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,160
now on that note

472
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,599
i'd like to uh

473
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,960
emphasize a bit be saying here saying

474
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
the art of asking questions so i often

475
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,520
see people asking the questions of are

476
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
we secure or not

477
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,840
but generally speaking we should

478
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,559
actually break that down a bit and what

479
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,679
what especially for forecasting

480
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,640
why because we then are able to develop

481
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
some sort of hypotheses which we can

482
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,280
also test and verify

483
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
and in the example you're seeing here i

484
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
use bayesian question clustering to

485
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,080
actually break a certain topic down

486
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,520
the point of the matter is is that in

487
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,200
the end you're able to actually not just

488
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
say we are secure but you can also say

489
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,280
we are secure because of abc and this

490
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,559
for now and this for the future

491
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,120
and next thing we actually should look

492
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
at is that it also comes at a cost and

493
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,799
there was also a thing highlighted in

494
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,480
the elephant in the room

495
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,720
now this example is

496
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
from a 1971

497
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
research journal which basically

498
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,919
compared

499
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,400
qualitative methods together

500
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
and what i find hilarious and

501
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
entertaining at the same time is that

502
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,080
these things are still pretty relevant

503
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,000
so one of the things i generally think

504
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,799
that

505
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,760
drive up cost or influence costs are two

506
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,640
things

507
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
and the first one being accuracy

508
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,320
um

509
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,280
you actually need people and skill to do

510
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,240
that and to actually work with that

511
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
and that that causes you to actually

512
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
have a lot of effort to put into that

513
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,840
now the second thing is the the time

514
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,919
associated with that obviously but also

515
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,600
the automation on that and any

516
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,080
computation you might need

517
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
obviously this is an example of 50 years

518
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,600
ago so 2 000 is probably way more now 50

519
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
years later

520
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,000
but i think the the essence is in this

521
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
is that there's always a technology

522
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,240
element related to for example the data

523
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,400
you use

524
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,960
now that being said um

525
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,480
there's a lot in my opinion there's a

526
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,679
lot of misconception on

527
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,559
the role technology plays in forecasting

528
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,039
and i strongly believe that you should

529
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,760
be very wary about

530
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,679
forecasting projects which have a large

531
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,000
emphasis on the technological bit

532
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,760
they're very cost heavy on that

533
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
but you also have to take into account

534
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,039
that there usually is also a human

535
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,039
needed to enter the data maybe cleanse

536
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,200
the data for example and those are some

537
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
of these small and practical things you

538
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,799
don't see often in project plans

539
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
another building block we need is

540
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,159
actually a point of reference to tell

541
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,600
our story

542
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
so i actually been talking about this

543
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,280
concept for a few years

544
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
but i generally find it be really

545
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,840
efficient to talk about scenarios and

546
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
especially how they relate to them and

547
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,720
how does that work over time

548
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,840
i usually

549
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
think that this is part of the end

550
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
product of a exercise and you just have

551
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,639
to find a good way to do that

552
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,320
and last year in in the same cti summit

553
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,760
i also

554
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,720
did a like a call to action for everyone

555
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,320
to explore

556
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,559
in their qualitative research to explore

557
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,039
further how can they move towards

558
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,760
um machine readable content and i think

559
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,240
this call to action still stands and i

560
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
would like to seriously invite every one

561
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,080
of you to collaborate on this basically

562
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
problem and and over the last few months

563
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,840
we already saw some initiatives

564
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
happening on that

565
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
and for today i'd like to add one

566
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,120
initiative to that so i'm now open

567
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,960
sourcing my scenario format which you

568
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
can get on the link which is shown on

569
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
screen and that allows you to then when

570
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
you do these kind of exercises at least

571
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,320
have a more or less a story format

572
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,440
that you can use to then map your

573
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
scenarios on so for example if you've

574
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,320
done a certain breakdown of a certain

575
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,200
geopolitical event right

576
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
you then figure out what kind of steps

577
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,600
will be happening

578
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
and you can use this kind of content to

579
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,880
then map that and present that to your

580
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
stakeholders

581
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,120
very useful stuff i really encourage you

582
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,760
to look into this

583
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,200
finally um one

584
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,280
building block we really need in my

585
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
opinion

586
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,320
is actually tracking and monitoring

587
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,360
i would like personally i i love the the

588
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,280
youtube conspiracy videos i i find them

589
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
very entertaining

590
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,440
and one of them i actually really adore

591
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,000
is one from new rockstars and what they

592
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,720
basically do

593
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
they uh look into uh different elements

594
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
of for example the marvel cinematic

595
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,080
universe and then dive into theories and

596
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
conspiracies and what could happen and

597
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
what indicators that could be

598
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,360
and i find that so cool and and what i

599
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
really enjoy is that they also every

600
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,559
year they do a what did we do wrong

601
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,600
session

602
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,679
and they use it in a very fun way where

603
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,000
they basically also

604
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
shame the presenter a bit

605
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,559
and i think i think that's awesome you

606
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,280
know humor always works and the reality

607
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,000
is is that um we actually in cyber

608
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,440
security we need more of that

609
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
we we don't see that often right people

610
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,320
saying hey we got that wrong i would

611
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,240
like to call out every vendor right now

612
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,000
and say hey you know you made some

613
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,080
predictions but what did you make what

614
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,760
if the predictions were that you made

615
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,400
last year and how did they fare what did

616
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,120
you think and what changed for example

617
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
and this goes for that kind of

618
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,159
deliverables but this also goes

619
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,480
internally for your own analysis you

620
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
actually do

621
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
so this means for example if you on a

622
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,640
daily basis look at doing assessments

623
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,240
you need to establish a sort of like a

624
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,960
way to look back at those assessments

625
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,120
and monitor if they were correct or not

626
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,280
finally that also helps you to do some

627
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
comparison and actually this could

628
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
actually be a cool team building

629
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,400
exercise as well

630
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,640
where you actually give a prize to the

631
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,120
individual that is really good at this

632
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,678
kind of thing

633
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,480
now

634
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
that is actually what i have for you

635
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,440
today do you the basics and those are

636
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
extremely important you really need the

637
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,840
basics to get going all right

638
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,640
um this could be as simple as aligning

639
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
on a data level it could be as simple as

640
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
talking the same language

641
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,799
but more importantly you actually need

642
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,840
to give this the priority it needs

643
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
it doesn't uh

644
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,320
i see often that people actually don't

645
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,240
do take the time to do this kind of

646
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,440
analysis

647
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
and that is you know that is obviously

648
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,919
up to up to those individuals but i

649
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
generally found that if you give it the

650
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
priority it deserves you can actually

651
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,919
reap the benefits

652
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,039
now i also mentioned for example that

653
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,840
these

654
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,480
using these techniques is not something

655
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,440
new right and even in the summit we've

656
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
been talking about this for a very long

657
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,159
time so for example in 217 we had rob

658
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
dardennel talk about it in 2018 we have

659
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,120
our rick howard talk about it in 2019 we

660
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
have amy baitlich talk about it today we

661
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,039
have already rebecca highlighting this

662
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,120
i think this is a topic where we will

663
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
continue to explore further how we can

664
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,760
you know use the simple basics of that

665
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
and use that in our daily lives and i'd

666
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
like to really stress that you know even

667
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,840
though these are small steps you know

668
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,919
these are huge steps in the in the

669
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,400
private sector

670
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
contemplate these three things today

671
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
figure out how they work for you and if

672
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,400
you really then think okay i want to get

673
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
my hands dirty on this forecasting stuff

674
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,480
being talked about and i have three

675
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,760
things i think you should be looking

676
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,240
