00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,600
hi everyone

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,920
uh i'm nate peachwestmoreland and uh

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
welcome to mark your calendars why dates

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
matter to adversaries over the next half

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,680
hour i'll answer that question then i'll

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,520
give you some methods and perspectives

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
to help you with your threat analysis

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,640
and research

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,920
for a little background i'm a threat

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,519
researcher mostly focused on

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,359
state-aligned threats

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,000
i'm also the head of strategic cti at

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,840
booz allen hamilton

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
disclaimer this talk is my own and does

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
not necessarily reflect the views or

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
opinions of my employer and disclaimer

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
i've been doing cti for a decade and

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
looking at international relations

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,640
through the lens of cyber since graduate

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
school

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
throughout this time i found that one of

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,640
the most interesting cti problems is

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,280
figuring out why an attack occurred like

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,159
why did an adversary decide to act

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
why in this form and why at this time

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
to answer that last question i found

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
it's useful to consider the role that

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
significant dates sometimes play in the

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,119
timing of attacks

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,920
so

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
what is a significant date

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
dates can be significant for a lot of

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
reasons

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,720
religious reasons like holidays and

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,000
festivals

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,720
uh civic reasons like professional days

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
national days memorial days

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
historic reasons like anniversaries of

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,479
major battles or treaties

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
legal reasons like when taxes or

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
corporate filings are due

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
in the context of attacks be aware that

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,399
dates can be significant to different

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,360
people

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
they can matter the adversary

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
they can matter to the target they can

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
even matter only to some third-party

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
observer especially in the context of

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
hacktivism or symbolic attacks

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,800
now i propose that adversaries care

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,680
about dates for two main reasons first

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
gates can confer some tactical advantage

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
wherein choosing to attack on a given

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,599
day

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,760
as opposed to any other raises the

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,520
likelihood of achieving some objective

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
second

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,280
dates can convey a message related to

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
the significance of a date when an

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
attack occurs

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,319
this allows an adversary to signal some

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,720
information that is such as perhaps

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,239
their motivation for attacking

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,560
so first let's look at how dates can

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,680
convey a tactical advantage to attackers

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,560
click

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
click

68
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,360
click next slide

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,599
there

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,159
all right so you see attackers have used

71
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,319
dates their advantage since long before

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,159
we found ourselves in this whole

73
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,159
internet mess in december 1776 general

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,760
george washington masked the main

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,239
portion of his army in pennsylvania

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
across the delaware river in trenton new

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,400
jersey a group of british-aligned

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
hessian soldiers were encamped

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
washington planned to cross the delaware

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
overnight on christmas march nine miles

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,280
and surprise these hessians

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,159
well at least some of washington's staff

83
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,760
believe that attacking on christmas

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
would give them a leg up

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
as one noted in his diary quote

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
they make a great deal of christmas in

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
germany and no doubt the hessians will

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
drink a great deal of beer and have a

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
dance tonight

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
they will be sleepy tomorrow morning

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
well ultimately

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
there is no evidence the hessians were

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,560
drunk but they were certainly tired

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
undressed

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
and caught by surprise when washington

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
attacked them at around 8 am about half

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
an hour after sunrise

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,439
on the morning of december 7th 1941 in a

99
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,918
surprise attack the japanese won a

100
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,478
shocking victory over the united states

101
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,080
in 90 minutes japanese bombers decimated

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,240
the us's pacific fleet which was docked

103
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
at pearl harbor

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,199
now

105
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
have you under ever wondered why

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
december 7th is the date that will

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,040
forever live in infamy and not say the

108
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,000
sixth or the eighth

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
in short japanese intelligence had

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
determined that a sunday would be the

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
best time to strike

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
first they assessed that the fleet was

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
most vulnerable on a weekend

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,720
the ships would consistently perform

115
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
training maneuvers during the week and

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
then returned to port

117
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
this could be easily observed as a

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,320
standard operating practice

119
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
second they assessed that americans

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
would be ill prepared for a battle on a

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
sunday morning

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,840
americans were identified as being

123
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,479
generally religious meaning that many

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,560
service members might be off the base

125
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,639
attending church or they'd otherwise be

126
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
taking a day of rest

127
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
these insights clearly paid off as pearl

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
harbor was ill-prepared to defend

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,960
against a surprise sunday morning

130
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,359
assault

131
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
probably the most common type of date

132
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,840
influenced cyber activity is date themed

133
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,199
fishing

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
at certain times of the year many people

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,039
expect to receive emails with

136
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,520
attachments to open and links they need

137
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
to click

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
think uh holiday greeting cards from

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,560
vendors

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
gift cards from relatives

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
some emails are even time sensitive such

142
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,680
as tax filing reminders from preparation

143
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
services

144
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,680
now some dates are thus ready made for

145
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
interaction

146
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
what's more an adversary can determine

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
if some dates are relevant to targets

148
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,240
with only a superficial socio-cultural

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
awareness

150
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,479
for these reasons basically

151
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
everyone does date themed phishing

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
for the most common scammers to your

153
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,120
high-end state actors

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
take the gru for example

155
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
in the days leading up to christmas 2016

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,360
the gru sent this

157
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,120
fantastic fishing note to embassies and

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,039
ministries of foreign affairs i really

159
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
hope you can read this on your screen

160
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
note all the fabulous details like

161
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,199
signing off with love from santa claus

162
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,840
and the note that the message was

163
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,639
handled by crit the christmas elves

164
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
mailing system

165
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
what's more

166
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,639
here's the cute card they included

167
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,759
complete with embedded malware

168
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
i don't know about you but i'd be pretty

169
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,400
excited to get gru malware for christmas

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,360
now

171
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,759
this lure must have been a hit because

172
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,800
they sent

173
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
this one

174
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
next year to all ministries of foreign

175
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,120
affairs diplomatic missions yada yada

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
now

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
if an adversary wants a slow or

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,360
lackluster response to the riskiest

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,039
parts of an intrusion

180
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,919
many choose to act when staff is least

181
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,240
able to respond this means timing

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,560
attacks or weekends and holidays when

183
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
people are out of office or on vacation

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,039
one memorable example occurred in nepal

185
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,080
on october 19 2017.

186
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,319
that day threat actor

187
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,280
maybe possibly north korea's blooner off

188
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,479
attempted to steal 4.4 million dollars

189
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,120
from a kathmandu based bank

190
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
sending the funds via swift transfers to

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,759
institutions in several different

192
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,520
countries

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
after having made some 31 fraudulent

194
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
transactions the attacker's attempt

195
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
appeared to have dropped a wiper or

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,800
equivalent malware that corrupted the

197
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
bank swift server leaving the bank

198
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,199
scrambling

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,680
to make matters worse the adversary had

200
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
timed the attack to occur at the start

201
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
of a five-day holiday tihar during which

202
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,599
most staff were on vacation thereby

203
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
slowing the response

204
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,279
there are many other examples of similar

205
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,479
attacks

206
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
quickly around

207
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
august 15 2012 shimoon wiper attack was

208
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,880
timed to occur near the end of the

209
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,279
ramadan season when many saudi workers

210
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
take time off to the proximity of

211
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
several holidays

212
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,200
reportedly more than 80 percent of

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
aramco's staff had taken time off for

214
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
that day

215
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,519
in anticipation of the important lailat

216
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,480
al-qaeda observance

217
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
criminals also like to do this

218
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,480
in approximately 2012 2013 five cyber

219
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
criminals reportedly stole

220
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
1.7

221
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
million pounds

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,040
from the bank accounts of 48 small and

223
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,279
medium-sized companies that were

224
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,920
customers of an unspecified slovenian

225
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
bank

226
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
the gang reportedly scheduled the

227
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,839
transactions to take place

228
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,279
on weekends or on national holidays to

229
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,880
reduce the chances that they would be

230
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,560
detected and blocked by the bank

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
dates may have significance both to the

232
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
adversary and their targets

233
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
in 2019 a widespread protest movement

234
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
had swept hong kong many locals were

235
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,120
alarmed by a proposed extradition law

236
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,959
that would have further eroded hong

237
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,160
kong's dwindling autonomy from mainland

238
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
china

239
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
on august 31st

240
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
democracy activists planned to hold a

241
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
massive protest

242
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
it was the fifth anniversary of beijing

243
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
announcing a controversial change to

244
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
hong kong's electoral process

245
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
but china had other plans it unleashed a

246
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,880
massive ddos using the great canon

247
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,720
overwhelming li hkj a web forum used for

248
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
protest organizing

249
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
undeterred the organizers planned for

250
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
another protest on october 1st

251
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,279
china's national holiday it marks the

252
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,680
founding uh the anniversary of the

253
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
founding of the people's republic of

254
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,959
china in 1949

255
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,839
well

256
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,920
this time the protesters knew what to

257
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
expect as this tweet shows protesters

258
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,800
plan for another ddos against l i h k j

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
kg

260
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
and consequently established backup

261
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
communications channels on twitter and

262
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,760
other platforms

263
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
afterwards by the way note the site

264
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
totally got ddosed into oblivion and

265
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,519
this attack was more than twice as large

266
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
as the august 31st one

267
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
so

268
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
what have we learned so far

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,959
one

270
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,440
adversaries know organizational

271
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
readiness is not constant they may plan

272
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,200
to take advantage of times of weakness

273
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,160
two

274
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,240
adversaries can predict many common

275
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
periods when targets are weakened or

276
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,399
susceptible like when staff are going to

277
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,920
be out of office or when they are

278
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,079
expecting to receive certain emails

279
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,359
attachments and links

280
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,720
okay let's switch things up

281
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,959
the other reason adversaries care about

282
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
dates is for signaling

283
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,720
i.e adversaries can convey meaning of

284
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
some sort to target audiences by

285
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,200
choosing to attack on certain dates

286
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,160
again

287
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,720
this phenomenon is not limited to cyber

288
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,920
activity

289
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,519
on july 5th 2017 north korea conducted

290
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,000
its first successful intercontinental

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,800
ballistic missile test a major national

292
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
technical achievement

293
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,040
well due to time zone differences it was

294
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,720
still the 4th of july in the usa

295
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,160
this wasn't a coincidence

296
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,320
now perhaps to make sure that the u.s

297
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,720
got the message kim jong-un addressed a

298
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,800
crowd of onlookers at the test site

299
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,440
quote american bastards would not be

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,279
very happy with this gift sent on their

301
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,600
fourth of july anniversary

302
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,839
the crowd burst out laughing he then

303
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,800
added

304
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,399
we should send them gifts once in a

305
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,920
while to help break their boredom

306
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,800
indeed

307
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,240
well so

308
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
this is not the only time north korea

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
has given the u.s an unwanted birthday

310
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
present

311
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,200
on july 4th 2009 u.s time july 5th in

312
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
korea a north korea controlled botnet

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
launched the first of three waves of

314
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
ddos attacks

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
the botnet targeted 26 websites of

316
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
various u.s and south korean government

317
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,279
media and financial organizations the us

318
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,000
targets included dhs

319
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,680
ftc

320
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,160
afaa yahoo washington post etc etc

321
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
the attack went on for several days

322
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,000
before infected computers wiped their

323
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,399
master boot records crippling many

324
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,720
infected bots

325
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,639
north korea did not issue a press

326
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,920
release this time but

327
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
they did leave a note

328
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
at midnight on july 10th local time in

329
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,399
korea the dozer malware began destroying

330
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,959
victims hard drives the malware

331
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,040
overwrote part of the mbr with the

332
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
phrase memory of the independence day

333
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
before proceeding to corrupt various

334
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
files

335
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,480
you see north korea rather likes using

336
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
dates to send these sort of stick in

337
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,399
your eye messages to the us and south

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,680
korea

339
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
other examples include a massive ddos in

340
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,880
2013 on the anniversary of the start of

341
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
the korean war

342
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,839
and a 2015 leak of sensitive south

343
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,399
korean nuclear plant files on south

344
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
korea's information protection day

345
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,399
now

346
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
anniversaries and holidays are popular

347
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
times also for hacktivists to hold

348
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
annual attacks

349
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
since 1951 israel has memorialized the

350
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,199
murder of the six million jews and the

351
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,680
heroism of jewish resistance fighters as

352
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,199
holocaust remembrance day yamashoa

353
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
it's a very solemn occasion in israel

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,079
that many israelis take very seriously

355
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
by the way side note this is distinct

356
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,639
from today's international holocaust

357
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
remembrance day an international

358
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,600
memorial day

359
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,760
so in 2013 anti-israeli hacktivists used

360
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
the holiday to stage a campaign called

361
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,279
op israel vowing to quote erase israel

362
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
from the internet

363
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,959
on april 7th

364
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,800
all sorts of hacktivist shenanigans

365
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
broke out you can expect what this was

366
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
websites were to face databases were

367
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,399
leaked ddoses disrupted or slowed down

368
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,680
major sites

369
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
attackers made lots of unsubstantiated

370
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,279
boasts

371
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,959
and so forth

372
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,800
this stuff went on for about 30 hours

373
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,519
before it finally died down

374
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,279
and they must have thought this was a

375
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,360
big success because anti-israeli

376
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
hacktivists have conducted an op israel

377
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,240
operation every year since on april 7th

378
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,519
there's just one little problem with

379
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,880
this timing

380
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,519
holocaust remembrance day indeed was

381
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,600
april 7th in 2013 but not so in other

382
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
years the date for this remembrance day

383
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
is determined by the hebrew calendar

384
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,120
consequently its date can vary from

385
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
anywhere from april

386
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,800
to early may

387
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
now therefore the anniversary of the fur

388
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,800
box first of israel has now become its

389
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
own significant date

390
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,000
not holocaust remembrance day

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
other other examples of similar

392
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
hacktivist uses of dates for rallying

393
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,880
include

394
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
911 the anniversary of the 2006 israel

395
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,560
lebanon war and guy fox day

396
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,759
now

397
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
sometimes an adversary wants to make a

398
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,360
point but it's a little more subtle than

399
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
we oppose you we aren't intimidated etc

400
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
and this is kind of hard to do the idea

401
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
that cyber attacks are

402
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
terrible for signaling

403
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,320
specific messages is a hot topic in

404
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,120
academic cyber literature

405
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,480
this example is a pretty good reason why

406
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,320
between 2015 and 2017 russia repeatedly

407
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,399
hit ukraine with destructive cyber

408
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,440
attacks

409
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,280
i believe russia was repeatedly sending

410
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
a message

411
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,720
history lesson in december 2013 russia's

412
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,880
vladimir putin offered a bailout to

413
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,679
ukraine's pro-russia president viktor

414
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,319
yanukovych he appeared increasingly

415
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,439
unstable and unable and perhaps maybe an

416
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,359
economic infusion might show up his

417
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,039
administration

418
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,640
on december 17 2013 the two men penned

419
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
an agreement wherein

420
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,840
russia would buy 15 billion dollars in

421
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,799
bonds and slash its natural gas prices

422
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
well the plan didn't work out as the

423
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,720
emergent europe and on movement toppled

424
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,679
yanakovic shortly thereafter

425
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,440
although the ukraine government appeared

426
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,360
resistant to paying down this debt

427
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,679
russia had a backstop that might force

428
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,679
ukraine's compliance

429
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
ukraine you see was seeking another

430
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,400
tranche of imf loans

431
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,799
according to traditional imf policy a

432
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,520
country could not deliberately default

433
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,080
on a loan to another country while

434
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
seeking imf

435
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,840
loans

436
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,720
well

437
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,360
that plan didn't work out either

438
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,679
on december 8th the imf announced that

439
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,360
it would allow ukraine to receive new

440
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,080
loans at this point russia proceeded to

441
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,880
go through the stages of grief

442
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
it angrily called the rules change hasty

443
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,600
and biased against russia it begged with

444
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,160
ukraine to still pay up it even then

445
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
offered to make a new deal with more

446
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,840
favorable

447
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,200
conditions okay that plan didn't work

448
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
out either on december 20th ukraine

449
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
defaulted on the repayment

450
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,000
over the next year russia appears to

451
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,480
have used cyber several cyber attacks to

452
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
make a point that it's stridently

453
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
objected to this default and the policy

454
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,559
change

455
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,760
first

456
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
three days after the default on the

457
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
energy loan the gru leverage existing

458
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,720
access to power distributors to shut the

459
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,840
lights off the day after energy workers

460
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,240
professional holiday

461
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,120
the next december on ukraine's army day

462
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
and two days before the anniversary of

463
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,520
the waiver the gru hit multiple

464
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
government agencies responsible for

465
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,559
ukrainian financial obligations

466
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,960
to make a point the attackers use

467
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,919
defacement imagery borrowing from the

468
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,640
debt

469
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
wiping hacktivists from the tv show mr

470
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,679
robot

471
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
then the gru disrupted power and kiev

472
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,679
with a logic bomb wiper with

473
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
two encoded start dates guess what they

474
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,400
were the anniversary of the energy loan

475
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
signing and the anniversary of ukraine's

476
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,679
default

477
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,600
perhaps ukraine didn't get the message

478
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,760
picking up speed over the next year

479
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
russia appears to have sought its pound

480
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,400
of flesh from ukraine's economy

481
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
within a day or two of various states

482
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
related to ukrainian independence

483
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
its association with europe and so forth

484
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,520
the gru used primarily financial

485
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
software supply chain attacks to

486
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
distribute faux ransomware in ukraine

487
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,200
going big with the massively destructive

488
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,919
not petty attack on the eve of ukraine's

489
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,840
post-soviet constitution

490
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,720
day so

491
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
now petya caused billions of dollars of

492
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,760
damage impacting many countries far

493
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,720
beyond ukraine and thus drawing global

494
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,320
ire

495
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,039
i believe that the eu that the gru may

496
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039
have sought to thwart this growing anger

497
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
by suggesting some

498
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,679
moral equivalency between itself and

499
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,400
ukrainian cyber forces

500
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
the idea i have is that the gre may have

501
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,280
designed bad rabbit to look like ukraine

502
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,679
aligned attackers had borrowed the

503
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,559
russian playbook

504
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,520
allow me to explain

505
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,559
like not petya bad rabbit was a wiper

506
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,960
disguised as ransomware

507
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,760
it's

508
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,960
amateurish over infection mechanism seen

509
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,760
here

510
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,679
fake flash downloads on mo on mostly low

511
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,880
traffic russian websites resulted in a

512
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,080
smattering of victims in russia

513
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,120
mostly

514
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
not very interesting victims

515
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,559
curiously then all of the major victims

516
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
were in ukraine much like not petya it's

517
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,280
ministries transportation and media

518
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,679
comments by ukraine security point to a

519
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,360
concurrent phishing

520
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,480
campaign

521
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,559
i've tracked this down i've tracked down

522
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,039
a lure it's trying to distribute a rat

523
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,480
disguises updates to accounting software

524
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,919
ah

525
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,400
in theory then this could be used to

526
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,799
navigate to the compromised websites and

527
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,080
download the bad rabbit flash updates

528
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,640
but of course borrowing the gru's

529
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
playbook would mean attacking on a

530
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,880
significant date

531
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
what's significant about october 24th

532
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
not much in ukraine

533
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,520
but

534
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,000
wait for it

535
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
since 2006 russia has celebrated on

536
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,200
october 24th special forces day it's the

537
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,799
anniversary of the soviet union

538
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,200
establishing the first gru special

539
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
purpose units in 1951

540
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,720
in other words october 24th is the gru's

541
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,280
professional holiday

542
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
chef's kiss

543
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,840
as we've just seen some adversaries like

544
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,159
russia and north korea really like using

545
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,000
dates for signaling

546
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,240
their own geopolitical competitors have

547
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,480
taken advantage of this fact to send

548
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,559
their own signals in response

549
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,000
on september 9th 2019 north korea

550
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,960
celebrated its national holiday

551
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,919
u.s cybercom celebrated this occasion by

552
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
uploading some new north korean malware

553
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,559
samples to virustotal

554
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,120
not with much fanfare mind you but the

555
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,280
message was clearly

556
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
we see

557
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,240
you

558
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,480
okay perhaps they were being a little

559
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,120
too subtle

560
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,760
in february 2020 cybercom tried again it

561
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,720
uploaded more samples on valentine's day

562
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,200
and this time as you can clearly see

563
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,919
they didn't forget to leave a note

564
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
after being repeatedly hit by russia

565
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
ukraine finally said last november that

566
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
two can play at that game publicly

567
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,400
pinning the armageddon or gemaradon

568
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
threat group on the fsb's 18th center

569
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,360
all while putin was in occupied crimea

570
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,039
celebrating unity day

571
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
in sum understanding that some

572
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
adversaries care about dates is quite

573
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,840
useful for threat research

574
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,120
it's helpful when you're trying to

575
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,039
assess an adversary's motivation and

576
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,720
intent as the date may be used to signal

577
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
this information

578
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,200
the dates may sometimes be messages may

579
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,679
sometimes be really subtle and thus

580
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
easily missed or open a reinterpretation

581
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
some adversaries especially north korea

582
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,559
and russia

583
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,919
really enjoy date signaling

584
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,279
so

585
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,600
what can you do as a threat intel

586
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,320
analyst or researcher with these

587
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,799
insights into date-minded adversaries

588
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,000
start by looking at your organization

589
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
and determine if there are certain dates

590
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
on which you tend to be weak or

591
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,120
vulnerable to attack

592
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,960
ask yourselves are these dates

593
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
externally observable or just easily

594
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,640
assumed by an adversary

595
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,240
now that we know when these dates are

596
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,120
make a staffing response plan

597
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,679
figure out how you can respond if it

598
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,480
hits the ceiling when everyone's on pto

599
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
when

600
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
ask yourself when are your staff likely

601
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,480
to be targets of date inspired phishing

602
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,640
if you figure this out let them know

603
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,559
raise awareness use examples use my deck

604
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,120
please

605
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
uh if you're a threat researcher try the

606
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,679
following process when you encounter an

607
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,799
attack

608
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,200
start by just figuring out the date make

609
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,000
sure you know the local time as dates

610
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
may change depending on time zone

611
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,039
figure out is it part of the work week

612
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,559
for any involved parties or is it the

613
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,840
work weekend

614
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
note that not every country actually

615
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,679
keeps a monday to friday work week

616
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,360
make a short list of the entities to

617
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,159
whom the date might be significant

618
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,200
start with the victim and the suspected

619
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,840
adversaries you're

620
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,760
considering figure out then how the date

621
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
might be significant

622
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,000
check some calendars online that have

623
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,640
holidays observances and professional

624
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
days for all the involved countries make

625
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,120
sure you use a calendar for the year of

626
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,760
the that the attack took place as dates

627
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,919
may shift

628
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,679
check the business calendar for these

629
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
countries for fiscal and financial dates

630
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,679
check out the historical significance

631
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,799
admittedly this can be a little harder

632
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,880
a good starting place would be to just

633
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
look on wikipedia if it's a really

634
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,320
significant date it will usually appear

635
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
on the country's page you just have to

636
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,919
do a fine page search

637
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,880
finally

638
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
just look at what the signs are what

639
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,000
does the adversary actually said to draw

640
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
attention to the date

641
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,279
messages in the code defacements etc

642
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,679
and then just check the official sources

643
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,080
has the adversary country said anything

644
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,639
relevant

645
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
to wrap this up

646
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,640
here are my three sound bites one

647
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,039
dates matter to adversaries

648
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,679
therefore they matter to you

649
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,880
two

650
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,399
if you want to defend against these

651
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,399
adversaries

652
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,039
be perceptive of when you are weak

653
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,440
predict when the adversary will figure

654
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,399
this out

655
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,919
and prepare accordingly

656
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,960
finally

657
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
if you are researching date-minded

658
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,960
threats

659
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,919
start by gathering all necessary data

660
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,320
just like i described

661
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,440
use it to place dates in context

662
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,399
and consider whether this changes your

663
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,559
interpretation of an attack

664
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,399
if you want to learn more about some of

665
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
these attacks i've dropped a bunch of

666
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,000
sources on a github repo link here

667
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,279
so finally

668
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,799
thanks for listening

669
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,080
and i'm happy to take questions
