1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,120
i am so thrilled to introduce our day to

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,400
keynote um lillian tang i first

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,840
encountered lillian i don't remember

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,440
when but i think it was when we were

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,600
both in government um she was previously

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,760
an ncis agent yes i believe that ncis

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,800
and

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,279
i have just had the pleasure of crossing

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,880
paths with her so many times throughout

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,080
our careers

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,320
um lillian is one of those people that

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,800
you'd meet and you just kind of get the

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
sense that she is a force to be reckoned

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
with if i were an adversary i would be

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,160
afraid of her

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,879
for good reason and um then i've had the

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,320
chance to kind of work with her a little

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,440
bit over in her her role at yahoo

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,800
leading threat investigation for the

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,640
paranoids which if you haven't heard of

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,199
that team um they do some really really

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,840
cool work against some pretty bad

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,199
adversaries

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
um and on a personal note this topic is

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,760
so crucial

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
i think so often in the world we're in

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
right now diversity equity equity and

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,520
inclusion can become buzzwords but

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
as hopefully everyone here knows

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
these things are core for intelligence

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
and cyber threat intelligence and that's

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
why i am so thrilled to have lillian

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
here to talk to us about why that is so

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,600
lillian

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720

company um i will have to say the author

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
paranoid is one of the awesomest cyber

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
security organizations out there if not

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,479

i use she and her pronouns and i'm

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,000
speaking to you from maryland which is

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
the ancestral lands of the piscataway

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
people

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
a little bit about myself i grew up

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,598
right here in maryland

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,000
i am a graduate of georgetown

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
university's school of foreign service

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
go hoyas

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
post 911 in 2003 like katie said i

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
joined the naval criminal investigative

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
service before anyone asked it was just

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
like the tv show but cooler

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
uh as a cyber special agent um i learned

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
host space and network forensics and

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
began tracking government-backed actors

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,319
really really back in the day

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,480
i served overseas in both the middle

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,599
east in asia and after leaving ncis in

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,239
2011 i joined booz allen which i

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,840
affectionately called the diet coke of

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,040
government

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,280
in with booze allen i worked at the

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
national cyber joint investigative task

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
force as well as the fbi's cyber

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,480
division asia cyber operations section

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,640
after over 10 years in government i

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
decided i wanted to try my luck at

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
private sector and i joined yahoo as one

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,640
of the first members and eventually the

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,239
leader of the advanced cyber effects

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,360
team

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
again tracking government backed hackers

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
i was subsequently promoted to the role

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,680
i'm in now which is the director of

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
threat investigations by overseeing

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
multiple teams who are passionate about

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,760
protecting our yahoo users from

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
malicious threats on the internet

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
in addition to this over my tenure at

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,599
yahoo i served as the global operations

91
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,480
or the co-lead of elevation our aapi

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
employee resource group

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
i'm chinese

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,560
i'm a cis woman in tech and i'm a mom in

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
tech and why does that matter

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
it matters because i'm often the triple

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,480
only where i may be the only person in

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
the room who is one

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
two or all three of these identities

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,159
i'm often faced with the glass ceiling

101
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,760
which is the invisible barrier to

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
advancement that women face at top

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
levels of the workplace

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,239
the bamboo ceiling which is the barriers

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
that exclude many asians and asian

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
americans from executive positions

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
and also this concept of the maternal

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
wall this is the bias that impacts a lot

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
of mothers or pregnant women to be

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
viewed as less competent and less

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,918
committed to their jobs

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,918
i'm here today to talk to you about

113
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,040
diversity inclusion equity and belonging

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
and why this is vital to cyber threat

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
intelligence

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
i'll be giving you some tips and tricks

117
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,479
for how to consider these principles in

118
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,320
your day-to-day whether you're an

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
individual contributor or a leader

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
uh to quote verna myers who is a

121
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
renowned diversity and inclusion expert

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,120
and vp of inclusion strategy at netflix

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,360
diversity has been being invited to the

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,600
party inclusion is being asked to dance

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
and when we talk about diversity

126
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,160
many automatically think specifically

127
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
along gender and racial clients

128
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,560
often because this is the data that's

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
most readily available collected and

130
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,400
reported

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
i would caution you to recognize that

132
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
none of these identities is a monolith

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
for example i identify as aapi

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
but that community represents over 50

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
countries in my experience as a first

136
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,759
generation chinese-american it's very

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
different from a hobong refugee and

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,800
although we're technically both aapi we

139
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,400
have very different perspectives

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,360
with this example what i'm asking is for

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
everyone to realize that diversity is

142
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,240
much more nuanced that multiple things

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
can contribute to building diverse

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,280
perspectives

145
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
these experiences

146
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,600
such as sexual orientation

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
economic status and marginalization

148
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,639
immigration

149
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,560
neurodiversity ability and even

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
caregiving

151
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,639
when i think about diversity it's not

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,400
necessarily to seek out certain

153
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
populations to tokenize which i'll talk

154
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,639
about later it's seeking a

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
non-homogenous breed

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,360
recall rebecca's keynote yesterday if

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
you didn't catch it please watch it on

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,759
replay she described seven various

159
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,639
desired cognitive skills there is no way

160
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
one person is going to have them all and

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
if you do your head will probably

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,440
explode

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
so how do you get these skills and how

164
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,919
do you embody them in your team you find

165
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,240
people of different experiences and

166
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,479
backgrounds who think these different

167
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,639
ways

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,880
going back to the party analogy i'm

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
going to lean into a conversation i had

170
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,560
with my colleague cindy young who's

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
yahoo's head of chronic inclusion who

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
i'm going to give credit to she made me

173
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
this beautiful graphic because i stink

174
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
at graphics i could not figure out how

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
to make a venn diagram and she just

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,600
manifested this and it's beautiful

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,880
um so

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,240
i'm going to walk you through this

179
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,919
really quickly

180
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,960
diversity is inviting a non-homogenous

181
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,560
population to attend representing a wide

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,440
variety of lived experiences

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
inclusion is making sure that the

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
multiple perspectives were solicited and

185
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
included for the party planning

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,880
equity

187
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,199
is where everyone is provided adequate

188
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,360
transportation to the party public

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
transit walking driving

190
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,120
and belonging

191
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
is where everyone is able to bring their

192
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,080
authentic selves and dance participate

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,720
however they want

194
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
i want to quickly touch on why there is

195
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
a shift to including belonging here

196
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,479
i mentioned this earlier but there's

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,960
this concept of tokenism and i'm gonna

198
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
just quote miriam webster they have a

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
really great definition which is the

200
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
practice of doing something such as

201
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
hiring a person who belongs to a

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,680
minority group only to provide criticism

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
and give the appearance that people are

204
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
being treated fairly

205
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
hiring a person and then forcing them to

206
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
represent an entire population is not

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,560
recognizing them as a whole person

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
think of it this way it's a bit of a

209
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,639
shift it's shifting from

210
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,080
what we've been taught as kids the

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
golden rule treat others how you want to

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
be treated to something called the

213
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
platinum rule which is treat others how

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,758
they want to be treated

215
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
so there have been a multitude of

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
studies done over the course of the

217
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
years on the effectiveness of diverse

218
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
teams in leadership

219
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,400
for example mckinsey and company has

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
been tracking this issue for almost a

221
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
decade

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,000
there are 20 19 results which are

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
pictured in the slide again show that

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,599
diverse representation literally equals

225
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,039
profits

226
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
in their research companies with more

227
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
than 30

228
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,919
women executives more likely to

229
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
outperform companies for the percentage

230
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,640
of women executives range from only 10

231
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,160
to 30.

232
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,640
in turn those companies the 10 to 30

233
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
range were more likely to outperform

234
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,760
those with even fewer women executives

235
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
or none at all

236
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,480
of note a 48

237
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,279
differential separates the most from the

238
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
least gender diverse companies that's a

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,680
lot of money

240
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
additionally mckenzie observed a

241
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,399
consistent trend where the likelihood of

242
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,399
outperformance continues to be higher

243
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,640
for diversity in ethnicity than for

244
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
gender

245
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,560
in 2019 top quartile companies

246
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
outperformed those in the fourth

247
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,399
quartile by 36 in profitability so again

248
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
leaving a lot of money on the table

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
there

250
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
another company cloverpop who

251
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
specializes in decision making software

252
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
uh also did an interesting study on

253
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
diversity and decision making why is

254
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,680
this important

255
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
decision making correlates to business

256
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
performance the better your decision

257
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
making capability is the better the

258
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
company performance is

259
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,720
so their research showed that inclusive

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,360
decision making leads to better business

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,880
decisions up to wait for it

262
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,720
87 percent of the time

263
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
business teams are able to drive

264
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,519
decision making twice as fast with half

265
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,839
the meetings and in this age of meeting

266
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,720
fatigue half the meetings i'm sold

267
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
and decision outcomes are improved by

268
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,680
about 60

269
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
as the pandemic has moved much of the

270
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,440
world online cyber security has become

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,279
even more relevant to the queen quote

272
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,959
everyday experience

273
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,360
from zoom bombing to ransomware shutting

274
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
down a health care system or a school

275
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,160
system

276
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,399
security is top of mind

277
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,200
so how should we think about dei and b

278
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,800
relevant to cyber security and cti

279
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
well

280
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,160
cyber security is one of the few fields

281
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
where there is a consistent negative or

282
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,800
zero unemployment rate

283
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,120
that means there are often more jobs

284
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,600
than there are people to do them

285
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,839
one statistic i recently read was that

286
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
in 2021 the world's open cyber security

287
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
positions is enough to fill 50 nfl

288
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
stadiums and i'm not actually a football

289
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,079
fan i don't know how many that is but i

290
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,959
imagine it's quite a lot of roles

291
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,360
uh adding to this there's this context

292
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
of the great resignation that's going on

293
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,519
where multiple shifts in the workplace

294
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,720
are occurring

295
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
from a labor shortage due to those who

296
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
are economically marginalized demanding

297
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,399
a living wage

298
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
to caregivers like myself who are often

299
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,240
we often disproportionately women being

300
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
forced to choose between loved ones and

301
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,640
work or jungle both

302
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
to mental health where we're now living

303
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
at work

304
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
and the overwhelming fatigue and burnout

305
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
any feel from living through march i

306
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,880
think it's 695th 2020.

307
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
that's a lot of challenges to overcome

308
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,600
but incorporating dei b principles can

309
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
help

310
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
according to forbes 44 of people they

311
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,839
surveyed said that candidates have

312
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
turned down an interview or a job due to

313
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
lack of diversity in the company's

314
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,079
workforce

315
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,519
a huge majority of the workforce 78

316
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,760
says it's important to them to work at

317
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,920
an organization that prioritizes

318
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
diversity and inclusion

319
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
and in fact more than half 53

320
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,079
consider it to be very important to them

321
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,959
so these numbers reflect how we must

322
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,639
incorporate these principles to be able

323
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,480
to recruit talent

324
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,760
to fill the 50 nfl stadiums of rules

325
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,319
that we have

326
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
additionally specifically in cyber

327
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
threat intelligence we face dedicated

328
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,600
human adversaries they're not taking a

329
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
break they're not going anywhere

330
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,399
many of them are tasked to reach your

331
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,959
organization some of them to put food on

332
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,040
their tables some of them to avoid

333
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
prosecution some of them just like to

334
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
watch the world burn now how's that for

335
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,440
a bunch of varying motivations

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,320
to cite a portion of the sans definition

337
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
of cti

338
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,720
malware is an adversary's tool but the

339
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
real threat is the human one and cyber

340
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
threat intelligence focuses on

341
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,000
countering those flexible and persistent

342
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,800
human threats with empowered and trained

343
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,639
human defenders

344
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,720
while we talk about technologies and

345
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
tools as this

346
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,079
as this definition demonstrates central

347
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,320
to this field is the humans involved

348
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,279
if we do not understand the experiences

349
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,519
of our adversaries we will not be able

350
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,920
to protect our organizations from them

351
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,079
i'll give you a small example

352
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,720
i recall in the early days of my career

353
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
a conversation i had with a network

354
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,040
defender this defender was freaking out

355
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
because they could not figure out why

356
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
the activity of a particular adversary

357
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
had seemingly disappeared they checked

358
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
all of their distractions all their logs

359
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,440
and they're all up and running but the

360
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
defender was baffled

361
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
well i cheated

362
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
i looked at a calendar and said hey

363
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,959
guess what it's chinese new year and our

364
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
adversary a chinese apg group was

365
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,279
probably celebrating this holiday right

366
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,160
now

367
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,399
and for more fun tales such as the one i

368
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,320
just shared please catch the replay of

369
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,639
my former buzz alley colleague nate

370
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
beach westmorelands talk from yesterday

371
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,199
on the importance of dates and also for

372
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,120
any asian apt trackers out there who

373
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,519
weren't all already aware lunar new year

374
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,240
starts this weekend

375
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,600
lastly we must understand and listen to

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
vulnerable populations and the people we

377
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
are charged with protecting

378
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
civil society and marginalized

379
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
identities often serve as canaries in

380
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
the coal mine for security features this

381
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,959
is the first targeted and sometimes the

382
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
most vulnerable

383
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,279
an example of this was a running app

384
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,839
that tracked and publicly posted the

385
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,760
running routes of their users in their

386
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,519
profiles

387
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,480
numerous women and activists pointed out

388
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
that this could be leveraged to stalk

389
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,279
people

390
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,040
of note according to the national

391
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
coalition for domestic violence one in

392
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,120
every six women and one in every 19 men

393
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
in the united states have been stalked

394
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,040
at some time in their lifetime

395
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,600
so this company ignored these concerns

396
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
what really got them to the table was

397
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,760
the us government who realized that

398
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
these routes that were being published

399
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,079
publicly were revealing for sensitive

400
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,839
military installments for around the

401
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,959
world

402
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,079
and this is just one critical example to

403
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
quote my friend lauren buddha founder

404
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
and ceo of real security of how girls

405
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,399
security is national security

406
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,680
so what do we do about this

407
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,839
a lot of what i'm talking about

408
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,000
underlying it is bias which we're going

409
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
to talk about here

410
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
in cyber threat intelligence we have

411
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,079
many structured analytical techniques to

412
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,480
ensure objective and data-driven

413
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
conclusions

414
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,079
these were created so we can avoid

415
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,480
certain biases in our analysis but

416
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,040
biases are so fundamental to who we are

417
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,680
as people and often originate from

418
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,279
societal structural or cultural reasons

419
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
they aren't all necessarily bad but

420
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
there are things we should be mindful of

421
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,600
and how they appear in certain

422
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
situations

423
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
there are many types of biases that

424
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,600
exist i believe katie and melanie had a

425
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,519
slide about it in their talk

426
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,399
um

427
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,000
they're just so many out there you can't

428
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,199
possibly cover them all in 45 minutes

429
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,720
uh but i'm going to talk about some

430
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,399
specific ones that i have observed

431
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
within the industry that we need to

432
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,000
watch out for

433
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,839
so the first one is conformity advice

434
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,480
so here you're pressured to agree with

435
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
others

436
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
you may second-guess your original

437
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,040
thoughts ideas or decisions based on

438
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
feedback from others

439
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,040
of note i do want to call out here that

440
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,199
this bias presents specifically in

441
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,120
certain identities such as being an

442
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,440
immigrant or first generation

443
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
because you are pushed to strive to

444
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,959
conform or insimilate into the society

445
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,440
or environment that you are now in in

446
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
order to basically survive and live

447
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,759
another example where this manifests is

448
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,439
in the hiring process

449
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
where members of an interview panel are

450
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
influenced by the feedback and source of

451
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,119
others

452
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,400
now one process that i use when i hire

453
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,280
is specifically to mitigate this bias

454
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
i document my feedback in my scores

455
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,880
first and then i ask the interview team

456
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,919
to individually provide me their scores

457
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,760
without the context of the rest of the

458
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
team and this way no one is peer

459
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,400
pressured to raise or lower a score for

460
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
a candidate

461
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
the next bias that i'm going to talk

462
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
about is affinity bias or similarity

463
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
bias

464
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
this type of bias leads you to form

465
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,919
deeper connections with someone where

466
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,400
you share perceived relationship

467
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,039
or share a perceived connection with

468
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,960
most people unconsciously surround

469
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
themselves with those who have

470
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,799
similarity with them and this often

471
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,960
manifests in group thinking

472
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,240
you can see this reflected in

473
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
gatekeeping behavior which i'll talk

474
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,360
about in a few slides

475
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,160
the next bias is beauty bias now this is

476
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,320
a bias where somebody who's considered

477
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,799
traditionally beautiful is unconsciously

478
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,679
viewed more favorably and one obvious

479
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
manifestation of this is the booth babe

480
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
or the promotional model phenomenon that

481
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
still occurs at conferences and trade

482
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,799
shows today

483
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,799
another bias that's somewhat similar to

484
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,440
this is the name bias it's where a name

485
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
which is perceived as different or

486
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
foreign or difficult to produce is not

487
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
viewed as favorable

488
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
for example my parents were immigrants

489
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,039
told me that they named me lillian an

490
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,120
anglicized version of my chinese name

491
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,919
leling to make things easier for me

492
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,880
growing up in america

493
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,320
contrast effect now this bias occurs

494
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
when two options are compared against

495
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,000
each other vice assessed individually

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,799
again this manifests quite often in the

497
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,120
hiring process such as during a resume

498
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
review or interviewing

499
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
where candidates are being assessed

500
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,520
against each other and not objective

501
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
criteria

502
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,799
often this bias is not intentional it's

503
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,280
a way our our brains have kind of a

504
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
mental shortcut because we are inundated

505
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,760
with resumes or interviews or

506
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,919
information it's a way to help us

507
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,640
process information

508
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
the last bias but certainly no not the

509
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,840
least is confirmation bias now this is

510
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,960
the tendency to find interpret

511
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,039
judge and retain information that

512
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
supports one's pre-existing needs and

513
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
ideas

514
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
this bias

515
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
can make people less likely to engage

516
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,799
with information which challenges their

517
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,840
view

518
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
the most obvious example of this has

519
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
been at the forefront of conversations

520
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
returning or pertaining to social media

521
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
social media bubbles and technology in

522
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
general

523
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
so how do you break these biases well

524
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,520
you guessed it uh seek out and interact

525
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,840
with the diverse population in multiple

526
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,640
experiences get out of your bubble see

527
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
things through a new lens

528
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
now this is often one of the most

529
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,919
meaningful and powerful ways to uncover

530
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,600
our personal bias

531
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,679
but that being said it has become

532
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
increasingly challenging in this coven

533
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,320
world that we live in with social

534
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
distancing people with varying risk

535
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,159
tolerances

536
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
some people are primarily engaging

537
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,159
online and others are more comfortable

538
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,240
being in person you have to find your

539
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,799
own path

540
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,280
so let's pivot a little and let's talk

541
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
about some major players in the cti

542
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,760
space who have already begun recognizing

543
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
these issues and adopting measures to

544
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,880
improve

545
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
for example lockheed martin i

546
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
professionally call him a stuffy uh

547
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
defense contractor sorry lucky

548
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,520
known in the cti world for the kill

549
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,400
chain model has gender representation

550
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,880
among its executive team approaching 40

551
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
according to the mckinsey study i

552
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
referenced earlier lockheed employed

553
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
some really key actions to encourage

554
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,799
their diversity

555
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,440
so they set enterprise-wide targets for

556
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,840
general

557
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
representation they took on a talent

558
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
evaluation process that's conducted

559
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
through an external partner to try and

560
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
eliminate unconscious bias in hiring

561
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,240
succession planning and promotions

562
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
they did novel immersive learning to

563
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,559
shift people's behavior and foster this

564
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,640
sense of belonging

565
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,679
they did data gathering via focus groups

566
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,760
anonymous employee feedback

567
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,400
exit surveys to inform decision making

568
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
and targets

569
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
another critical piece is that these

570
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
efforts didn't just come from hr or the

571
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
dei and vt

572
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
lockheed's executives bought in with the

573
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,840
ceo serving as the lead champion for

574
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,640
this in setting expectations

575
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,520
this structured and universal approach

576
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,600
is particularly important

577
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,240
a 2016 study in the academy of

578
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,640
management journal demonstrated that

579
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,039
women gender minorities and bipolar

580
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,200
leaders who engage in dei and b

581
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,159
activities were rated much worse on

582
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,000
performance evaluations than their white

583
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,159
no counterparts to engage in similar

584
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,039
activities so having a program where

585
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,440
this is universally applied

586
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
will help mitigate this particular

587
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,679
challenge

588
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,760
another example here is mitre which is

589
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,240
known for minor attack and miter engaged

590
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
frameworks

591
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,640
they created an awesome autism network

592
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,679
program called the portal project

593
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,159
the project provides training not only

594
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
to employees on the autism spectrum but

595
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,600
to their co-workers and managers

596
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
by modifying the onboarding and support

597
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
process for employees on the spectrum

598
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,120
and educating their colleagues

599
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,240
they seek to improve communication and

600
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,919
encourage creative perspectives

601
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,400
this enhanced perspective will also

602
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
benefit current employees including

603
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,640
those already owned those on the

604
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
spectrum

605
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,919
now the exciting thing is this program

606
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,720
was expanded and in 2021 the

607
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,440
neurodiverse federal workforce pilot

608
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,159
program began running at the national

609
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,240
geospatial agency

610
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,360
now why is this important well a

611
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,159
disproportionate amount of

612
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,720
neurodivergent people experience

613
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,760
economic marginalization or poverty

614
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,159
a federal government job has been a

615
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
demonstrated way for marginalized

616
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,520
communities to break the poverty cycle

617
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,240
for them and their future generations so

618
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,559
you do the math here

619
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,360
and right here at the sans summit the

620
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
graphic recording for visual learners

621
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
acknowledges that there are multiple

622
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,039
learning styles

623
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,480
and yesterday

624
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,799
the coolest thing ever happened the sans

625
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,600
cti summit in espanol

626
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,080
the impact of this is amazing in

627
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,559
reducing barriers to knowledge and entry

628
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,720
into a field

629
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,120
when i was growing up english was not my

630
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
first language

631
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,919
i distinctly remember one time asking my

632
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,760
best friend a question

633
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,840
she kind of turned to me gave me a funny

634
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
look and responded i don't speak chinese

635
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
and this was the first time i realized i

636
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
was different in operating in a

637
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,679
different world can you guess how old i

638
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
was i was five years old many people who

639
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
grow up speaking another language have

640
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,799
very similar experiences

641
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,360
and the fact that sans

642
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,400
is recognizing this and creating content

643
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,880
to make people feel like they belong

644
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
holds a special place in my heart

645
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
coupled with amazing programs like the

646
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,039
hbcu stands academy and partnerships

647
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,600
with women and veterans organizations

648
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,080
they're helping to open doors for the

649
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
next generation of cyber security

650
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,159
practitioners

651
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,919
now i promised i would talk to you a

652
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,600
little bit about gatekeeping i think

653
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
cyber security's favorite topic

654
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,159
we as an industry need to move to

655
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,799
opening not shutting doors

656
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,200
i've seen this manifested in so many

657
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
ways as i'm sure you have as well

658
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,039
the tension between it and cyber

659
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
security and this perception that you

660
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,760
must pay your dues first in another

661
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,799
field to work in cyber security

662
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,200
the hiring manager who doesn't take an

663
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,159
opportunity to create a true entry-level

664
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,799
position in cyber security the hiring

665
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,120
manager that isn't willing to grow and

666
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,039
retain talent

667
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,279
the job descriptions that are just copy

668
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,080
and paste with unrealistic skill sets

669
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,240
who do not account for non-traditional

670
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
backgrounds uh school foreign service

671
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,080
major right here

672
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,640
uh economic barriers to entry in those

673
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
job descriptions such as requiring a

674
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
degree or an advanced degree or

675
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,760
certificates that are so expensive and

676
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,919
often unattainable for economically

677
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,320
marginalized groups

678
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
underlying all of this is another type

679
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,520
of bias experience bias

680
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
where we as humans take our perception

681
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
to be the objective

682
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,320
as a hiring manager or a recruiter or

683
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,640
somebody on an interview panel it's

684
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,520
often human nature to reflect on your

685
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,919
experience and incorporate that into

686
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,000
your expectations or your job

687
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,720
description or your candidate selection

688
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,960
and as referenced in melanie and katie's

689
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,799
talk structured intentional hiring and

690
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,880
interview processes will help you break

691
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,720
this habit

692
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,520
so

693
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,279
you've finally made it through the first

694
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,720
date and gauntlet and you've gotten

695
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,600
yourself a cti job congratulations

696
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,559
now comes the dreaded trust group

697
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,360
and that that you also have to get into

698
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,799
for your job

699
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,799
taking a small tangent here but be sure

700
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,640
to check out grace's amazing research

701
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,360
and talk on cti networking effectiveness

702
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
later today at the summit

703
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
but going back to this concept of trust

704
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,440
groups you probably guessed where i'm

705
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,919
going with this but the biases that i

706
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,120
flagged earlier affinity bias similarity

707
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,159
bias are alive and well in these groups

708
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,320
oftentimes you have to be vouched to get

709
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,120
in

710
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,760
which this behavior skews towards always

711
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,240
bringing in the same type of perspective

712
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,559
or experience because of the inherent

713
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,080
trust

714
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,039
for these communities i implore you step

715
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,919
back audit your membership take a close

716
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,159
look at what perspectives you have and

717
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,559
which ones are missing be very

718
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,080
intentional about filling those gaps

719
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,799
and in recognition or maybe frustration

720
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,960
of the difficulty of getting into these

721
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,440
trust groups strives have been made to

722
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
share information outside of those and

723
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,919
create more inclusive accessible

724
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,600
communities

725
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,000
from discord groups to engagement on

726
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,480
various social media the opportunities

727
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,880
have definitely expanded but there are

728
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
underlying issues that may not be

729
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
recognized

730
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,159
for example i jokingly call myself a

731
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,720
digital fossil i'm not on twitter not on

732
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,360
tick tock and while that's mostly true

733
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,919
because i'm a fossil i also want to call

734
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
out that social media is not always a

735
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,000
safe place for everyone and could

736
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,720
actually be an invisible being

737
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,760
a recent 2021 pew research study

738
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
revealed that 41

739
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
and i'm actually shocked this isn't

740
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
higher of all americans have been

741
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
harassed online

742
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
of that 41

743
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
75

744
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
reported that harassment occurring via

745
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,679
social media

746
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,760
according to that same cue study lgbtqia

747
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,480
plus adults are particularly susceptible

748
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,360
to facing harassment online with roughly

749
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,159
seven in ten having encountered any

750
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,000
harassment at all and more than half 51

751
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,880
being targeted for more severe forms of

752
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
online abuse

753
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
in cyber security twitter often reigns

754
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,480
supreme

755
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,679
but try and recognize that in 2018

756
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,240
amnesty international published a study

757
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,799
specifically on the toxic effects of

758
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,760
twitter for women and gender minorities

759
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,399
highlights of that report include that

760
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,399
64 of women surveyed believe that online

761
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,240
abuse or harassment of women is just

762
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,120
common

763
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,159
you know it's just the thing that

764
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,440
happens

765
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,919
um a majority of those women because of

766
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,880
that engage in self-censoring and they

767
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
do that to protect themselves online

768
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
so most of these issues that i've talked

769
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,720
about have been systemic gatekeeping

770
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
challenges which obviously are very

771
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,559
difficult to overturn

772
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,600
but i'm also going to talk briefly about

773
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,200
self-gatekeeping that sometimes also

774
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,840
happens and this is where you take

775
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,159
yourself out of contention for a role or

776
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,000
an opportunity

777
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,720
oftentimes this is a result of certain

778
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,520
ingrained values for example i grew up

779
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,279
in what is generally referred to as a

780
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,720
tiger family

781
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,279
as a daughter of immigrants i was taught

782
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,039
to always excel

783
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,480
keep my head down

784
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,919
work hard and wait for recognition

785
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,039
if the recognition didn't come except

786
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,120
life is unfair and full of times where i

787
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
would need to so cool

788
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,240
swallow my bitterness and carry on

789
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,840
for those who have been taught to

790
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,399
internalize these values we need to

791
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,480
recognize and unlearn some of these

792
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,760
tendencies

793
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,000
so i had a long conversation about this

794
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,399
with my therapist and she reframed it

795
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,240
for me in a beautiful way which i'm

796
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,159
going to share with you here

797
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,520
so this imposter syndrome is your brain

798
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,919
protecting you from being hurt it's the

799
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,159
voice of your fear and the fears of

800
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,799
those before you trying to protect you

801
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,480
from future harm

802
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
it's also honestly the way you know

803
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,120
you've chosen the path of growth

804
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
and once you learn to recognize this and

805
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,279
appreciate it you can begin to let it go

806
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,919
and aim for that job or that promotion

807
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,440
opportunity

808
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,519
and if you have trouble letting it go

809
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,279
because this is honestly sometimes a

810
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,480
lifelong struggle keep working on it but

811
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,559
surround yourself with a network of

812
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,519
friends

813
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,320
family mentors allies who are going to

814
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,320
genuinely champion your strengths

815
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
so this kind of brings me to my next

816
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,799
topic which is fear

817
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,039
now you may recall me mentioning i'm a

818
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,240
mom and tech

819
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,080
you probably should have also guessed at

820
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,840
that point but there was no way we were

821
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,519
going to escape this talk with at least

822
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,880
one mention of daniel type oftentimes in

823
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,360
cyber security there's fear

824
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,799
fear we're going to hire the wrong

825
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,840
person

826
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,720
fear

827
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,399
that we hire that wrong person doesn't

828
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,919
work out

829
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,320
fear we don't hire quickly enough and we

830
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,519
lose the spot fear in the trust group

831
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,799
that the person you vouch doesn't fit in

832
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,880
what i would say to this is lean into

833
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,039
this particular daniel tiger song it's a

834
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,720
favorite of my three-year-old right now

835
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,559
she runs around her house singing along

836
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,519
all day long which goes it's okay to

837
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,799
make mistakes try to fix them and learn

838
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,159
from them too

839
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,399
i'm not a great singer but anyways

840
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,480
take a chance on that person with a

841
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,799
non-traditional skill or background or a

842
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,399
lived experience

843
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,559
their perspective will enable you to

844
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,799
identify blind spots and innovate to

845
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,559
solve new problems

846
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,279
examine your organization is there an

847
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,440
opportunity to promote internally to

848
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
increase representation for a specific

849
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,559
role

850
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,799
rather than looking at a person in terms

851
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,360
of fitting in or culture fit look for

852
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,960
culture ad

853
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,600
again according to cloverpop their

854
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
research the research that i mentioned

855
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,240
earlier you can see that diversity it

856
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,320
does increase friction by a very small

857
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,360
amount but look at the boost in results

858
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,320
when you add inclusion aka looking for

859
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,120
culture add it obviously outweighs that

860
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,519
so what are some tangible actions

861
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,799
everyone can take

862
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,360
well first and foremost mentorship is

863
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,440
vital to the community and tanisha

864
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,679
martin executive director of black girls

865
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,640
hack gave an amazing speech that stan's

866
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,880
half-vest on this topic i'm giving you

867
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,200
all homework go find this on the stands

868
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,880
website or youtube right now i'll wait

869
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,640
use your favorite search engine

870
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,960
go on youtube go on sans you need to

871
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,440
watch this talk

872
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,000
so i'm going to expand a bit on

873
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
tanisha's talk

874
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,840
we need our community to move towards

875
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,679
being sponsors so this is putting social

876
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,240
business capital towards retaining and

877
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,799
advancing diverse practitioners

878
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,120
if you consider yourself an ally in this

879
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,559
space

880
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,519
providing feedback emotional support and

881
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,600
guidance through mentorship absolutely

882
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,720
vital but we also need those doers those

883
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
who are using their capital external to

884
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
mentorship

885
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,639
people who are opening doors for others

886
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,280
to walk through especially those who may

887
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,719
go unnoticed

888
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,040
the sponsor role works with the mentor

889
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,960
or the protege but there's an added

890
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,800
component of influence where you're

891
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,960
influencing an external audience or

892
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,079
partner to help advance that protege

893
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,480
now this isn't the ultimate solution but

894
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,359
this is a tangible step that anyone can

895
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,879
take

896
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,040
so what does this look like

897
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,199
i'm going to use a framework by rosalind

898
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,520
chow who is associate professor of

899
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,079
organizational behavior and theory at

900
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,079
carnegie mellon university it's called

901
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,199
the abcd's sponsorship

902
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,839
so the a here is for amplify where you

903
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,800
can create or increase an audience

904
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
positive impressions

905
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,960
a great example of this in cyber

906
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,520
security is to share the mike cyber

907
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,000
campaign started by lauren zabrik and

908
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,960
camille stewart to amplify black cyber

909
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,839
security practitioners

910
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,320
another important thing to highlight

911
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,640
about this particular campaign is the

912
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,720
concept of making space

913
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,359
giving a marginalized voice the

914
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,680
opportunity and platform to share their

915
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,320
truth in their own words is powerful

916
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,000
visibility

917
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,240
a more individualized approach you can

918
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,280
take

919
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,200
is when a marginalized person makes an

920
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
important point or suggestion in a

921
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,000
meeting

922
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,320
but that point is either ignored or

923
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,359
immediately shut down or other steps

924
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,320
so

925
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,400
you know it's disregarded

926
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,520
so the action i'm asking is to step in

927
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,240
redirect back to that person's idea give

928
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,680
clear support and credit to its source

929
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,599
for example and you might say something

930
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,920
like the following i'd like to go back

931
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,480
to what so-and-so said previously this

932
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,119
was a strong idea it provided a number

933
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,800
of great solutions that would move us

934
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,520
forward or whatever i support their

935
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,839
approach and i can offer a few ways to

936
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,040
help them make it happen now this

937
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,960
statement oh it forces others to listen

938
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,200
and it also keeps people from taking

939
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,200
credit for ideas that are not their own

940
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,760
the b here is for beast

941
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,160
and this is where you increase others

942
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,960
expectations of the of the proteges

943
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,079
potential and readiness and you formally

944
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
nominate them for an opportunity

945
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,839
this could be as simple as an employee

946
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,680
referral a letter of recommendation a

947
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,000
speaking engagement or a nomination to

948
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,920
that coveted trust group we were talking

949
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
about

950
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,119
another way you can demonstrate this is

951
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,720
if you're a hiring manager you're

952
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
interviewing candidates

953
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,480
look around your department see what

954
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
other roles are open

955
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,960
sometimes job descriptions are not best

956
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
written

957
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,839
um and somebody that applies for your

958
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,000
role may actually be perfect for a

959
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,839
different role in your department

960
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,359
definitely feel comfortable referring

961
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,920
them taking that step and

962
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
pushing them for that additional

963
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,320
opportunity

964
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,119
the c here is for connect

965
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,280
and this is where you seek to increase

966
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,920
the person's visibility by introducing

967
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,760
them to people in your network who might

968
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,839
help them in their goals

969
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,920
some companies have gone so far as to

970
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,839
institute formal sponsorship

971
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,160
opportunities for new hires they connect

972
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,560
them to senior leaders who can regularly

973
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
offer guidance and are actually

974
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,359
positioned to accelerate their career

975
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,680
and for the leader this reverse

976
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,079
mentorship structure is a way to broaden

977
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,920
their perspective and see the

978
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,880
organization with fresh eyes

979
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,119
now recall earlier i had a slide where i

980
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,760
said not all bias is bad and this is

981
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,119
actually where i encourage you to

982
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,359
leverage a particular bias called the

983
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,720
halo effect for one outstanding quality

984
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,119
or accomplishment takes precedence over

985
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,040
any negative attributes

986
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,920
in this case you're the halo and you can

987
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,960
seek to cast your halo on the person or

988
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,280
the group you're mentoring or sponsoring

989
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
use your voice to give them visibility

990
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
and in fact you may have noticed i've

991
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,000
been trying to do this throughout my

992
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,079
keynote referencing other speakers and

993
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,400
voices here at sales

994
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,920
lastly the d is for defend

995
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,119
where you seek to reverse or neutralize

996
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,040
others uncertainty or negative

997
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,119
perceptions of the protege

998
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,800
and this goes back to the title of my

999
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,880
talk use your voice

1000
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,040
challenge the negative perception

1001
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
provide an alternate explanation and

1002
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,680
protect this person from harmful

1003
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
exposures

1004
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,680
an example of this is this common meme

1005
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,000
or misconception that i hate which is

1006
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,560
that the talent pipeline is not diverse

1007
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,800
because these candidates don't exist

1008
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,440
that's sorry are my language

1009
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,079
it's 100 untrue these candidates are out

1010
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,079
there and if you can't find them it's on

1011
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,320
you you're looking in the wrong spot and

1012
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
if you need help finding these

1013
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,000
candidates let me give you a hand right

1014
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,119
now women go to girls security women's

1015
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,839
society cyber jets women in security and

1016
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,240
privacy the diana

1017
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,079
