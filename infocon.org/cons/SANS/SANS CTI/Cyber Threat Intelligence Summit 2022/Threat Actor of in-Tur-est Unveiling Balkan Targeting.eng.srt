1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
um this is the actor of interest

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,360
unveiling balkan targeting and uh we're

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,799
going to be talking about a

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,400
investigation

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
um into a threat actor that we did the

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
attribution the assessment and the

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,240
activities that we saw

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,320
um so a little bit about me um i'm jack

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
simpson i've been in pdbc for four years

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,679
focusing in the euro region mostly

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,239
focusing on russia-based directors a

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,840
little bit from a personal life i'm a

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,239
west ham fan some call it soccer some

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,840
call it football

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
i nearly cried watching the euro finals

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
and also i'm a big fan of goose island

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
ipas i will be covering the technical

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
side of this talk and i'm going to hand

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,600
over to louise to talk about herself

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
thank you jack um thank you so much

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
everybody for joining us today so i'm

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
louise i lead our euro research desk

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,120
and as scott gave in the introduction i

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
do focus in particular on the strategic

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
side of house and our analysis

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
my background is in eastern european

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
languages and politics

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,119
like jack i'm also a bit of a football

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,119
slash soccer fan but um somewhat

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
unfortunately my team are very much

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,240
underperformers compared to the team at

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,080
jack supports so we'll gloss over that

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
one quite briefly um in today's session

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
i'm going to be following jack with a

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,560
bit of an overview of some of the

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,799
geopolitical landscape against which

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,640
we've been seeing white to operate so

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,119
without further ado jack i will hand

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,000
back over to you

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,159
cool so what we're going to do is we're

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,759
going to look at the very start of the

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,799
investigation so you know on the 29th of

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
january 2021 i observed the domain

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
qov.rs

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
rs is the top level domain for serbia

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
and what we observed was a phishing page

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,880
when looking at the html source code we

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,759
observed that ht track software copier

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,040
or website copier had been used to copy

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
a

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,479
a website and it had been modified by a

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,439
threat

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,080
for phishing purposes it also shows the

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,720
date so we were able to identify

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
one sort of where this came from so as

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
you can see that's highlighted on one of

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
the pictures we can see

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
this was trying to fish the ministry of

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,440
defense of serbia but we also saw the

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
date and the difference between a domain

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
registration and the

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the copying of this website now there's

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,920
a lot of unrelated threat actors that

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
use this so this isn't a really

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,440
interesting data point but from that to

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,599
start the investigation we we start we

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,760
need to build up a lot of information

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
about this particular character because

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
when looking at it from the start we we

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
haven't seen something like this from a

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
thracter that we currently track and so

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,720
we were trying to get as much

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
information to see if we could really

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
drill down into that

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
so a lot of legitimate users also use

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
this software so it isn't just used by

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
threat actors

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
we saw this domain

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,319
being published on social media so on

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,599
twitter a security researcher put qov.rs

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,040
and talked about how this was a phishing

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,360
page and within a couple of hours the

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,879
threat actor stopped the domain

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
resolving to an ip

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
now of course we just heard a talk from

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,879
cyber reason about attribution and not

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
of course jump into conclude conclusions

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
and that was something you know it could

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
be a coincidence we we don't know too

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,920
much about this threat actor we're

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
coming in fresh so we've really got to

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,879
look at it but we've got to remember

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,400
that piece of information as well

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
because that you know that's interesting

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,560
to us because the phishing page was

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
online for two weeks so it wasn't a

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
small amount of time and the you know

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
distract could feel you know it's too

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,799
risky to have some of that information

100
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,879
on social media and so they'd prefer it

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,760
to be dropped so with that when we found

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
additional infrastructure and started

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,799
looking at this we decided to think

104
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,560
about giving this threat or a new name

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,879
like many people in the industry do and

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,040
we gave this throughout the name white

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,959
terr the reasoning for white is that

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
it's to us we've given it an unknown

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,920
origin and tur in our naming convention

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
we give a mythological creature in the

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,319
second word there's also other colours

112
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,760
like blue which is a russia-based

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,159
tractor and red which is china-based

114
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,239
so when looking at finding additional

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,079
infrastructure what we did is we went on

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
that qov.rs

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and we looked at it what it was

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
resolving to so what ips it was

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
resolving to and we found a number of

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
other domains which going through them

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
and trying to identify them you know as

122
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
an analyst you're trying to see if

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
there's any similarities in registration

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,320
data and themes and what we found was a

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
lot of these domains that were shared

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
with each other were related to or had

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,160
themes of serbia and republika srpska

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,600
now on your right you can see a

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,199
multigraph if you haven't seen a

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,840
multigraph before it's perfectly fine

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
what we're showing here is that there's

132
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
some form of cluster we can see the blue

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
our domains and there are orange circles

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
there which are ips and these are all

135
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
interconnected the main reasoning i'm

136
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,479
trying to show this is that there are

137
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,759
some threat actors that like to

138
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,080
compartmentalize their infrastructure so

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,560
i'll have one domain to one ip and then

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
another domain to a different ip

141
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
in this particular instance this threat

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
actually found comfortable that they

143
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,880
would have one domain resolving to a one

144
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,120
ip and that ip had a number of other

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
domains which we assessed was likely

146
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,759
their activity so we've got a number of

147
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,120
those domains

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
on our screen um and after doing some

149
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
research we started to really pull back

150
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
some of the consistent themes that we

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,680
saw from this threat actor so we've got

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,479
the malicious domain sajam.us which is a

153
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,600
malicious domain spoofings the jam.rs so

154
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,240
gmrs is an exhibition center in serbia

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
and when we looked at the registration

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
data of the malicious domain we observed

157
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,080
that actually this exhibition data was

158
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
hosting a defense fair around the same

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,039
time

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
giving us more information

161
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
for us to to identify this character a

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
little bit more um we also saw a

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
telecommunications company being spoofed

164
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,160
emtel and we also saw vlada rs dot co

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
spoof and vladimir rs.net which is the

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
republic of srpska official government

167
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,520
domain so after all of this finding this

168
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
infrastructure there's one thing for me

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
as a threat analyst a question that i

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
have and that is

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,560
was it a pen test because it's very easy

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,280
to jump into conclusions of espionage

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
crime motivated but the very first

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,919
question i have to think about is

175
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
was this an orgasm organization trying

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
to simulate

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,840
a threat actor that's an apt or a crime

178
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
motivated threat actor or is this

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
actually something that i want to track

180
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
and look at

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
so with that question in mind we

182
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
observed from the fladder rs.co

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,000
domain a blog post from the official

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,880
republic of srpska

185
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,639
website and they had a blog post

186
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,560
referencing this domain and they were

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,880
describing how they had emails in april

188
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
2020 which is a little bit further back

189
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
from our new investigation and they

190
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
discussed how this email don't click on

191
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,280
these links don't click on the

192
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
attachments this is spoofing us you

193
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,039
shouldn't be doing this and so we

194
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,720
started to think and put an assessment

195
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
that it's unlikely a government would

196
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,400
report on a penetration test and release

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
these indicators are compromised it's

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,400
certainly possible still but from aaron

199
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
from our assessments it's unlikely so we

200
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
looked a little bit further into this

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,759
vladar rs.co domain

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,800
and we observed a uh archive and it was

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
hosted on a url which is in the pink box

204
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,720
down below and it had a unique id 5611.

205
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
so observe this zip archive we knew that

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,360
it was hosted on a domain of interest

207
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,400
and we also had a blog post referencing

208
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
this and it you know them talking about

209
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,039
the maliciousness of this domain so then

210
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,520
we had to sort of confirm what if we

211
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
could connect those two things together

212
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,039
and we did so what you've got there is a

213
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
link that we assess is an outbound link

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
from the

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
official republic of serpska um

216
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
government and their web now and it's

217
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,319
redirecting to that specific id url

218
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
which is in the red and the reasoning

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
here is that we're not just seeing it

220
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,800
hosted on the vlada's vlad rs.co

221
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,479
uh domain we're actually seeing it where

222
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,319
it's actually got the redirection as

223
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,360
well

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
so in that file in that archive was a

225
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,319
hta script and that once you execute

226
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,479
that hta script you observe a message

227
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,400
like this and it's got covid19 themes

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
much like a lot of threat actors in

229
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
april 2020 at the height of the pandemic

230
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,000
and what it's doing in the background is

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
it's loading powershell code to x

232
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,440
finally execute a certain payload but

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,039
what was really interesting for us when

234
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,958
looking at this of course is signaturing

235
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,958
opportunities and looking and trying to

236
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,279
identify what we can do to further track

237
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,080
this threat actor so what i found

238
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
interesting was this particular

239
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,479
background color

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
so when looking at that background color

241
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,360
using it and signaturing it the specific

242
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,320
value three nine six one a two we were

243
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,120
able to observe additional samples from

244
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,959
the threat and allowed us to identify

245
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,800
additional infrastructure

246
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
additional weaponized document simply

247
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
from looking at that background color

248
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
now when it was loading that powershell

249
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
code it did it from a different domain

250
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,680
dropbox dash online dot pro and what is

251
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,640
really interesting what i'm trying to

252
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,040
drive down is the argument as well of

253
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
the interconnectedness of their

254
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
infrastructure from when we were kept

255
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
looking at their different parts of

256
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
activity so as we can see there's

257
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
vladivost.com at some point that was

258
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,440
resolving to the the ip

259
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,200
94156 18912

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
and again dropbox dash online dot pro

261
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,040
was also resolving at some point to that

262
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
ip as well and you know some threat

263
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,279
actors don't like hosting the payloads

264
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,000
and communicating in the same ip in this

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
particular threat actors case they don't

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
mind it

267
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,480
so after identifying multiple samples

268
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
and you know seeing a number of pieces

269
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
of infrastructure weaponized documents

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,080
and malware we started to identify some

271
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
patterns as you should as a threat

272
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
analyst and we started to identify

273
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
handles and we can see here ten show

274
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,839
there was a folder for infrastructure

275
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,240
there was a portable debug path the

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,519
using ten show um atarox was referenced

277
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,440
in weaponized documents by whiteter

278
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,880
because they used an unregistered

279
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
version of sublime text but they also

280
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
had atarox available in portable debug

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
paths so again we use these handles

282
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,519
particularly tensho shads and atarox as

283
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,360
opportunities to signature with other

284
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
things that were previously observed by

285
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
the threat actor and it allowed us to

286
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
further build the picture of what this

287
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
threat actor is about

288
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
with that intelligence we identified a

289
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,079
number of themes and as a for analyst

290
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,440
i'm just going to identify two that

291
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
really struck with me when looking at

292
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,440
this particular threat actor and that is

293
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,920
the ammunition factory and ammunition

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
identification technology i have not

295
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
observed that from a character in my

296
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,079
personal experience and so that really

297
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
struck with me looking at this actor

298
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
so then when we looked at defense and

299
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
government targeting um we saw a

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
document lure being used um with some

301
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
malware and the document law had a

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
particular date on it when looking at

303
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,839
that and observing the malware metadata

304
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,760
we actually saw that the throat

305
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
took about one to six days for a

306
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
turnover from the document lure to

307
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,839
actually converting it with the actual

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,440
malware and packaging it which you know

309
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
gave us more insight and understanding

310
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,959
about this threat and how quick they

311
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,279
sometimes can be

312
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
we also saw this thractor compromise a

313
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,120
legitimate website which strengthened

314
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
our argument about it not being a

315
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
penetration test and we observed a

316
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,880
number of things weaponized documents

317
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
power shell codes

318
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,240
you know c2 pages and we also observed a

319
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,560
victim log so what we did when we looked

320
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
at this particular victim log we saw a

321
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
single line which was on your screen now

322
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
and it had an ip that was based in

323
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,040
republika srpska so again strengthening

324
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
the serbian republic concepts go of

325
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,839
interest and we assess this was a victim

326
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,959
you know there's a number of people that

327
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,720
might say oh it could be the operator

328
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
but looking at our intelligence and

329
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,160
looking at you know our assessment we

330
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,920
took the decision that this was likely a

331
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
victim

332
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,079
so then looking at the infection chain

333
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,160
we've talked about the hta script and

334
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
how it loaded powershell code and i want

335
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
to talk about the powershell code a

336
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
little bit because it can be of interest

337
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,560
with this particular threat white

338
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,600
so they used wmi objects to be able to

339
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
identify parts of the environment not

340
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
too dissimilar to a lot of threat actors

341
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
um so they wanted to know about what

342
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
antiviruses were there what the domain

343
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,000
name was what the computer name was

344
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,079
and then they used bits the bits

345
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,240
transfer powershell module to be able to

346
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
communicate that to a c2 and give that

347
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
information before they execute the next

348
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
payload which would be an lnk file the

349
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
reason for highlighting the bits

350
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,639
transfer powershell module because a lot

351
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,480
of thread actors use that in powershell

352
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
is that they also use it in their

353
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,279
windows binary back door

354
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,360
so some of the problems that you face as

355
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
a threat analyst is sometimes in an

356
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,120
infection chain you're not getting to

357
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,880
the final part and in that particular

358
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,959
case we got a hta script a powershell

359
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,800
code in that particular point we didn't

360
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,839
get the lnk file um but in this case

361
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,519
when looking further into the samples

362
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
and getting the signaturing i then did

363
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,560
identify a backdoor and a full infection

364
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
chain so we saw a weaponized document as

365
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,399
the initial infection vector then an

366
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
extra cell file then an

367
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,200
lnk file and then a jscript loader which

368
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,440
led to a jscript payload now jscript

369
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
should not be

370
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
um confused with javascript it's one of

371
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,959
the interpreted languages used in

372
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,720
windows script hosts a lot of people

373
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800
know it as wscript

374
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
and it's similar to a vb script if that

375
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
helps

376
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,720
and this particular jscript loader

377
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,480
showed that the thracta had some

378
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
thoughts when it came down to evading

379
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
static analysis they decided to encrypt

380
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,959
their payload using rc4 and it required

381
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
a key that was an md5 hash and we're

382
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,519
looking at these infection chains we

383
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,480
start start to see common things uh

384
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,519
common

385
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,760
uses of the infection chain and we saw

386
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,399
extra cell files commonly being used to

387
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
execute the jscript payload um it was a

388
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,160
popular choice by whitetail so we took

389
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,920
that and we another data point you know

390
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,519
that they've got a preference towards

391
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,160
that the jscrip payload has very simple

392
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
functionality so it had um execute

393
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,199
commands it had sleep and a default

394
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,720
response and so what i've done here is

395
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,079
i've got some of the command lines

396
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,279
there's a picture there just to help

397
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,199
people sort of visualize what it looks

398
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,000
like

399
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,079
so then with that sort of signaturing

400
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,760
opportunity of the jscrip we also

401
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,519
observed a windows back door from the

402
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,920
throat actor with very simple commands

403
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
again similar execute command sleep and

404
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
default response and so what i've done

405
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
is i've given some wireshark goodness to

406
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,199
the right uh we've got a example of who

407
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,760
am i with the execute command

408
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,839
and one of the reasons why i'm sort of

409
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,000
highlighting the execute command is that

410
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,519
there was a really good indicator of

411
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
compromise when it came down to this

412
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
specific variant of the windows malware

413
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
is that it uh piped the execution of the

414
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,800
command into a static file which is in

415
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,519
the example command box it read that and

416
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,160
then sent it over so if you had you know

417
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
looked at the the victim

418
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
you would be able to identify it because

419
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
they used a static file to pipe the

420
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
result of their commands

421
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,079
so with that we found a really

422
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,880
interesting case that um sort of put

423
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
some doubt into me whether i got it

424
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
correct we observed an open source

425
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
project open hardware monitor we

426
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,720
observed that with in within an archive

427
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,600
and we we saw whitetail's back door in

428
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
it but we it wasn't in the public

429
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,079
project it was just a sample i observed

430
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,399
um and i started to really doubt with my

431
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
analysis whether i'd got anything this

432
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
correct because it looked really strange

433
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
how this was sort of presented when i

434
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
went deeper into the visual studio

435
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,560
project

436
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
of open hardware monitor in this archive

437
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
i saw that they'd added a pre-build

438
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
event and as you can see you might see

439
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,480
some similarities to the powershell code

440
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
that was in the previous slide and they

441
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
were essentially doing the same concept

442
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,399
they were loading the powershell code

443
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
through this pre-built event to execute

444
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
a payload now this technique had been

445
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,160
used by zinc

446
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
many know them as lazarus we track them

447
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,639
as black artemis this is an unrelated

448
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,160
threat actor but this technique was

449
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,839
reported by microsoft and this was

450
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
around a similar time frame to what this

451
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,360
threat actor whitetail was doing so they

452
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
finally at some point during this

453
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,079
process it would execute the windows

454
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,759
binary backdoor command.dat which is um

455
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,720
the last part the payload and when

456
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
looking at that we observed some really

457
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
strange links

458
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
it had a digital signature and the

459
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,680
digital signature name was star-artov

460
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
when looking at you know pivoting off

461
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
that and looking into different samples

462
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,680
we observed trick bot we tracked them as

463
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,399
white magician they had samples related

464
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,480
to this we saw parallax rat samples

465
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,399
which are mostly crime motivated with

466
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
this digital signature name and we also

467
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
observed some unidentified samples which

468
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,799
looked crime motivated and this gave us

469
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,079
some doubt whether we've got this

470
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,000
correct there's a lot of mess here and

471
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
we you know we had to look back a little

472
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
bit and try to understand what had gone

473
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,839
on here and from our assessment what we

474
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,439
identified is that this command.dat file

475
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,679
is likely white terror they're using the

476
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,199
tent show handle which i've got there

477
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,439
the portable debug path but also that

478
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,280
it's likely that whitetail used an

479
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,840
underground crime service to acquire a

480
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,919
digital signature for this malware and

481
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
many other threat actors used it and

482
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
therefore this digital signature was

483
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
shared

484
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
so then we moved to other crime links

485
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
which confused me and made it really

486
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
difficult to try and understand the

487
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
motivations of this particular threat to

488
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,799
white tear we saw an espionage cv sample

489
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
which is to the left and we saw an

490
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
invoice theme sample which we suspected

491
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,600
was a crime motivated sample in their

492
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
metadata they had the exact same author

493
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
metadata very similar loader url but

494
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,160
they're looking at the submissions of

495
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
these particular files we saw some

496
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,799
consistency with the white tur sample

497
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
with serbia submission and then with the

498
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,360
suspected crime sample we saw the us and

499
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,919
japan so very different very out there

500
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
the sample size of all of this was very

501
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,600
small as well so it's really difficult

502
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,960
for us to truly

503
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
understand what's going on

504
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,600
and also the crime motivated sample was

505
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,679
on a domain we assessed was also crime

506
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,760
motivated um we didn't know where the

507
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
white cv sample was was hosted or if it

508
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,600
was used it how it was given to a victim

509
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
and so it's really difficult for us to

510
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,799
make this assessment unless you know

511
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,720
when you're investigating a threat you

512
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,919
don't think you currently track you're

513
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,840
trying to identify

514
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
the motivations and different patterns

515
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,520
and in this particular case the sample

516
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
size is too small for us to truly

517
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,080
understand this particular case whether

518
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,960
this uh the thractor is using sometimes

519
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,600
espionage and sometimes crime or whether

520
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,799
it is using these crimes uh crime themes

521
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,400
to look like it's doing crime but it's

522
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,160
an espionage or another hypothesis

523
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
so then one of my final points i'm going

524
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,679
to talk about is something i commonly

525
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,120
seen with threat actors when you're

526
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
looking at them is this is from a

527
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
conference paper about a china-based

528
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,440
actor and they had re-registered a

529
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
domain that had previously been white

530
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
tears and if you hadn't seen all of the

531
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
nuance of what i just talked about all

532
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,679
of the different signaturing and all of

533
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,120
the different patterns that were just

534
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,240
observed and just looked at the

535
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,080
infrastructure you would have thought

536
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,160
about linking these two threat actors

537
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,919
with each other and in that case it

538
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
isn't you know the it's just that the

539
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,919
threat had re-registered at that

540
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,000
particular domain the last point i want

541
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,799
to talk about is um attribution phases

542
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,360
in timo stefan's book about attributing

543
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
through actors he talks about the 4c

544
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,160
model and attributing through actors

545
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
from what we've done and what we're

546
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,480
looking at with whitetail we think that

547
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,799
we're at the technical clustering phase

548
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,520
currently when looking at the 4c model

549
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,880
so now what i'm going to do is i'm going

550
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
to hand over to louise to talk a little

551
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
bit more about the strategic side

552
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
thank you jack

553
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
so absolutely as jack's touched on that

554
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,840
we have seen some challenges when it

555
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,320
comes to attribution around white hair

556
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
and and and what's driving their

557
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,720
activity and jack's touch on their like

558
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
possible fluidity around links to

559
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
criminal activity possibly espionage

560
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,720
motivated

561
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
and as i'm sure a lot of us are aware on

562
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,640
this call that you know concrete

563
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,039
attribution can be very difficult and i

564
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,320
didn't bring my crystal ball with me

565
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
today unfortunately

566
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,919
in this particular case when it comes to

567
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,400
white hair um you know we have seen it

568
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
it's targeting in particular the defense

569
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
sector it has a very specific focus on a

570
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,159
particular part of eastern europe and

571
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,159
the balkans there's possibly an

572
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,600
espionage link there so potentially it

573
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
could be easy for us to jump to

574
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
conclusions but you know we are

575
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,720
intelligence analysts so we have to

576
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,320
challenge these assumptions and make

577
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
sure we're examining all of the evidence

578
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,400
that we have to hand so for the next few

579
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
minutes and we'll take a little bit of a

580
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
step back and look at the wider

581
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,280
strategic context around which some of

582
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,240
this activity is happening

583
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
so

584
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,080
as we've seen um whitetails targeting

585
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,039
has primarily focused on entities in

586
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,440
serbia and in republic of serbs

587
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,760
um so that's uh in a part of the part of

588
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
the world called the balkans which is in

589
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
southeast europe you can see on the map

590
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,919
there

591
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,600
and i think just at the outset it's

592
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,080
important to flag that um you know in in

593
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
very recent memory actually the collapse

594
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,400
of yugoslavia did precipitate a violent

595
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,880
conflict that was driven by a variety of

596
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
factors such as language

597
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,400
language borders and religion identity

598
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
and actually a lot of these factors

599
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
still actually shape the region today so

600
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
this is a very complex part of the world

601
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
and i will try to be respectful as

602
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
possible for some of these sensitivities

603
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
as we walk through the next few minutes

604
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
um so serbia hopefully is going to pop

605
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
up on my oh there we go oh no i went too

606
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
fast um

607
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
oh no sorry

608
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
this is where it all falls down um here

609
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,360
we go okay so back to serbia there we go

610
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,799
and so serbia and its neighbor

611
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,280
montenegro actually formed what ended up

612
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
being the rump of the old socialist

613
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
republic of yugoslavia

614
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,320
montenegro gained independence from

615
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,360
serbia back in 2006 and that really kind

616
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,760
of marked the last the last remnant of

617
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
what had been the federal yugoslavia

618
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,280
which had disintegrated over the course

619
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,400
of a number of years of conflict

620
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,840
um republican serbs however is possibly

621
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
a name that's a little bit less familiar

622
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
to some of you and it is actually a more

623
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,080
complicated situation as well so there

624
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,240
are two federal entities that make up

625
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,159
bosnia herzegovina so we have the

626
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,559
majority ethnic serbian republic of

627
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,720
serbs and then there's also the bosniak

628
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,880
croat federation as well and this

629
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
structure actually came about as a

630
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,559
result of the dayton agreement which was

631
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,520
established back in 1995 and that was in

632
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,919
the aftermath of the bosnian conflict

633
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,360
and that agreement

634
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,280
stipulates actually very specific power

635
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,679
sharing and arrangements between those

636
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,159
two entities which um which ensures that

637
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,520
there is fair ethnic representation

638
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,400
so

639
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
um with that context in mind when it

640
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,280
comes to geography we can then um begin

641
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
to think a little bit about why the

642
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
defense sector in particular might be of

643
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,039
particular interest to and to whitetail

644
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,880
as a threat actor

645
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,720
so within the serbian economy actually

646
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,320
the defence sector is a very key

647
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,799
strategic area um the serbian defense

648
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,400
industry is is the largest in the

649
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,559
western balkans it consists of around

650
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,960
200 companies or so and tends to be

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,200
largely dominated by and by state-owned

652
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
arms manufacturers and um interestingly

653
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,480
actually serbia overtook croatia as the

654
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,360
largest regional military spender um in

655
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,760
2019

656
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,600
um for republican serbs go slightly

657
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,960
different so there were significant

658
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
reforms pushed through in 2003 um aimed

659
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,919
at establishing a unified armed forces

660
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,000
command so the country does actually

661
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,919
have a joint armed forces across both of

662
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
those entities that i flagged

663
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,840
and actually as a little bit of an aside

664
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
at this point um it's maybe interesting

665
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,400
to note that back in 2003

666
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,240
it was actually reported in open source

667
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,039
that the then president of republic of

668
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,799
um dissolved the military intelligence

669
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,720
office and that followed reports that

670
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,159
the office had been operating

671
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
intelligence collection campaigns

672
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,919
targeting nato and other international

673
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,039
officials in the region

674
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,240
so

675
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
um

676
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
we can now begin to sort of examine some

677
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
of those vested interests in the sector

678
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,279
in this part of the world and that can

679
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,880
really begin to help to inform some of

680
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
our wider attribution analysis so jack

681
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
as we've seen he's been looking at the

682
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,559
kind of the how and the what of this

683
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,799
activity associated with white her a

684
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,640
strategic perspective can help us

685
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,360
understand the why a little bit more um

686
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
and again as i've said we want to avoid

687
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
these analytical biases so at this stage

688
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,840
i think it is important we do take a

689
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,480
broad view of the geopolitical context

690
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,400
to be to begin to consider why a threat

691
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,720
actor um perhaps motivated by

692
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
nation-state interests could potentially

693
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,039
be conducting this type of activity

694
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,080
so firstly um as i've said republica

695
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
does actually form a constituent entity

696
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,000
within bosnia-herzegovina

697
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,679
and relations between the central

698
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,279
government and sarajevo and the

699
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,240
republican service administration are

700
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
a little bit on the on the tenants

701
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
side sometimes um

702
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
so the the president of republica

703
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,080
has previously threatened to actually

704
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,279
withdraw from state state-level

705
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,799
institutions

706
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,720
and actually announced in october of

707
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
last year and so just a few months ago

708
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
that republica serbs go would actually

709
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,080
be looking to take over the military

710
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,000
facilities that are currently managed by

711
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,840
the bosnian armed forces

712
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,039
um moving on so kosovo um actually has a

713
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,080
an over 90 ethnic albanian population

714
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
and it declared unilateral independence

715
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,799
from serbia back in 2008.

716
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,960
however it is actually still home to a

717
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
very sizable serbian minority in the

718
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
north of the country

719
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,240
and a lot of that community don't

720
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,480
currently recognize kosovo independence

721
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,159
so tensions between those two

722
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,880
communities do do tend to run fairly

723
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
high so there is still actually a

724
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
nato-led peacekeeping mission um known

725
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
as kful which is deployed to the area

726
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,799
and actually as an example of this in

727
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,400
september of last year there was a

728
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,919
dispute over vehicle registration

729
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
between serbia and kosovo and that led

730
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,760
to a border blockade and there were

731
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
reports of special police force is being

732
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
deployed and also military aircraft

733
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
patrols as well

734
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,640
slightly further afield um primarily due

735
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,799
to its position with regard to kosovo

736
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,440
and other interests serbia and has been

737
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
open to cooperating with with other

738
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
international partners so

739
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,039
serbia tends to be russia's closest ally

740
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,960
in the balkans region and this

741
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,559
relationship does actually extend into

742
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,640
the military and defense space as well

743
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
so serbia for example hosted joint

744
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,720
military exercises in october of last

745
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,279
year and russia is also a key military

746
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,919
supplier of hardware um so that's

747
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,159
included helicopters tanks and fighter

748
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,520
jets which have been which have been

749
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,960
sold to uh to serbia

750
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,120
again slightly further afield so

751
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,480
serbia's actually sought to position

752
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,080
itself as something of a strategic hub

753
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,000
for china um acting as a bit of a

754
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,919
conduit for trade across south east and

755
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,799
central europe um this collaboration is

756
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,159
a little bit less developed in the

757
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,159
defense space although serbia has

758
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,600
actually purchased surface-to-air

759
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,399
missiles from china and uh notably

760
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,720
actually in 2020 so a couple of years

761
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,039
ago now serbia received a shipment of

762
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,520
chinese drones and that was actually

763
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,279
china's first export of military

764
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,600
aviation equipment into europe so we can

765
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,279
see there that serbia has also provided

766
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,120
china with a bit of an opportunity to

767
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,559
establish a foothold in the european

768
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,640
defense market

769
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,399
and then last but not least on our

770
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,880
whistle stop tour um so serbia's

771
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,640
relationship with the west which for the

772
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,279
most part is through nato and the eu and

773
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,760
it is largely cordial and so serbia

774
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
doesn't have a specific interest in

775
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,279
joining nato but is a member of nato's

776
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,360
partnership for peace program and

777
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
serbian forces have cooperated with the

778
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,760
nato-led k4 deployment which i mentioned

779
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,799
previously

780
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,320
including for example performing joint

781
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,640
patrols

782
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,039
unlike its position on nato belgrade is

783
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,880
actually pursuing membership of the eu

784
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,279
which is one of its key trading partners

785
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,360
and progress towards accession has been

786
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,760
a little bit stalled um the eu does

787
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
actually facilitate dialogue between

788
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,399
kosovo and serbia um but there are there

789
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,000
are a few kind of technical issues which

790
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
which kind of hinder progress towards

791
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,080
its accession

792
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
so

793
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
with all of that in mind where are we

794
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,159
left so

795
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
as you've seen we haven't attributed

796
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
whitetail to a specific originating

797
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
geography yet but hopefully that

798
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,279
geopolitical explanation i've given you

799
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,960
at a fairly high level does begin to

800
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,720
highlight some of those complex

801
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
interests that we will be taking into

802
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
consideration as our analysis and

803
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,720
attribution analysis progresses

804
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
um also just a flag that if this

805
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
presentation from jack and i wasn't

806
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,120
enough um we actually have a sister

807
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,799
technical blog which has been published

808
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,200
today and that includes additional

809
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,279
technical analysis and indicators which

810
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,880
complement obviously jack's portion of

811
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,559
this presentation

812
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,720
we do being very high tech actually have

813
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,120
a qr code which links directly to the

814
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,480
blog that's on the next slide which

815
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,640
we'll put up and also when you look

816
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
through our slides and there is a

817
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,679
technical appendix as well at the end of

818
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,880
this

819
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,600
so

820
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
um next steps so from the strategic side

821
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,520
i will be keeping an eye on the

822
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,159
political situation in

823
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,120
bosnia-herzegovina and also in the wider

824
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,960
region as well and of course i'll

825
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,360
continue to liaise with jack on tracking

826
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,120
further targeting assessing the

827
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
implications of that activity and our

828
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
attribution analysis will be an ongoing

829
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,000
process as well um so jack any final

830
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,320
thoughts from you before we wrap up with

831
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,399
some questions

832
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
yeah so i'm just really interested to

833
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,440
see how they react to this presentation

834
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
or if there's a change in tradecraft or

835
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
what what sort of reaction is done after

836
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,520
this so we saw previously with the

837
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,679
security researcher on twitter and that

838
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,520
being dropped immediately i'd like to

839
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,559
see how that goes

840
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
so here we go there's the qr code

841
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
um

842
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,720
i think we maybe have a couple of

843
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,760
minutes if there are any questions

844
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,919
otherwise jack and i will be hanging out

845
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,760
in our hallway for the next half hour so

846
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,120
