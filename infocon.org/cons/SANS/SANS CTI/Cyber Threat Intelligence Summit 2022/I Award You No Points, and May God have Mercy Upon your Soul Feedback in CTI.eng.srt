1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,799
our next talk

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,480
i'm excited about for a couple different

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,519
reasons

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,679
um the first reason and anyone who is a

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,679
fan of the movie billy madison might be

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,679
picking up on this in the title which is

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,440
a reference to that movie

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,119
that's one of my favorite movies of all

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,359
time i know it's not good and for any

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,600
other billy madison fans i'm drinking

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
out of my mug that says that's

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,960
quack-tastic it's a blue duck

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
so that's one reason i'm excited about

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479
this talk the billy madison references

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,680
but more importantly arguably it's going

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,440
to be talking about feedback garen's

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
going to be talking about a really tough

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,160
topic

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
feedback is absolutely essential to any

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,000
cti analyst success right we need to

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
know if our consumers our products are

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,399
getting through if they're hitting their

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,800
requirements but it's really tough for

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
our consumers to give us that feedback

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,199
so

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,440
garrett ginovan is going to give us some

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,120
tips on that

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,320
garrett i see you're joining

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
let me see you there

and so you should be able to click into

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
your slides in just a moment

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,799
and of course if you have questions for

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
garrett or the chatter head over to your

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,439
slack channel hallway garrett ginovan

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,759
hopefully i said your last name right

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
sometimes i'm terrible woo-hoo well

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,159
that's awesome

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,600
you didn't you did katie thank you i

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
appreciate it and it's an honor to speak

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,040
today so i appreciate this um across

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
across the board

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
so again my name is garrett ginnoven i'm

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
currently a threat analyst at proofpoint

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
with the people-centric security program

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
and again it's an honor to speak today

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,680
and really what we want to talk about

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
today is improving that producer and

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
customer

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,159
feedback within the cyber threat

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
intelligence life cycle and um with my

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
current position at proofpoint i'm kind

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,840
of a customer-facing analyst and i work

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,079
with a great team of people and have an

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,240
even greater team of people supporting

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
the larger kind of threat and tones

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
apparatus that proofpoint has

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
and today

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
when it comes down to the agenda

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,680
there's the billy madison reference for

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
you this is basically how i felt in all

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
my briefings as a junior officer in the

62
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,639
army reserves and first off who am i who

63
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,000
is this guy i'll have a couple key

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
takeaways today i'll go kind of a quick

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
baseline of what feedback is and what

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,959
are the main kind of points feedback and

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,200
cti and then some

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
small takeaways that consumers and

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
producers can improve so i know with the

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
cyber threat intelligence piece here for

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,959
this training summit it's very much

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
focused on producers i'm a producer

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,640
myself right now from that standpoint

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
but also talking about both consumers

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,800
and producers from kind of the two

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
buckets and then

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
of course it's a feedback presentation

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
so i have to have the thank yous and a

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
few sources as well and uh

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
and katie you're one of the many thank

81
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,120
yous i'm gonna have at the very end but

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,879
again i'm very happy to be speaking

83
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
today and honored to to be able to have

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
this time

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,519
so again fred analyst at proof point and

86
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,200
you can see what i can kind of consider

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
the plinko career journey that i've

88
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
taken so i started off

89
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,239
on the very top i actually did dairy

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
judging while i was in high school i

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,519
went into turf grass science at penn

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,159
state worked the masters of all things i

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
went to indiana university and learned

94
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,239
foreign languages i'm a mediocre persian

95
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,080
linguist at best

96
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
very much a mediocre runner and a fan of

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,159
single malts and bourbons and then from

98
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,000
there i've i've worked in the uh

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
cyberthrone pilgrims field supporting

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
army and navy customers kind of get a

101
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
little shot in at the navy and then uh

102
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,280
most recently the department of energy

103
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,080
and now currently at proof point so one

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
of the bigger pieces that yes anybody

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,920
can get into information security

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,040
anybody can get into cyber threat

107
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,159
intelligence i know there's a lot of

108
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
great talks about that right now of

109
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
getting in and

110
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
uh just getting your foot in the door

111
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,519
and and making an impact so yes even

112
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
myself who did dairy judging and worked

113
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,959
the masters and worked literally for

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,480
for turf grass and golf courses can get

115
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,760
into cyber threat intelligence

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
so kind of the key takeaways today where

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,159
i know everyone listening right now

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,439
you're dealing with multiple things

119
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
whether it's kids

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
hopefully mine stay quiet during this

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
presentation but basically looking at

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,239
feedback is a true section of the

123
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,959
intelligence life cycle within cti and

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
treating it as that when we look at the

125
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
larger intelligence pieces that we see

126
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,199
also looking at feedback as a two-way

127
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,279
street with different vehicles so

128
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
not everyone needs a tesla and that's

129
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,079
kind of one of the pieces when we think

130
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
about okay you can get feedback via

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
face-to-face briefings

132
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
virtual briefings like this

133
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
emails surveys there's a variety of

134
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
different ways to do that and it's all

135
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
different tools in your toolbox to get

136
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,960
the feedback that you want to make that

137
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
cyber threat intelligence better and

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,479
better day in and day out

139
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,919
one of the big pieces here especially

140
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,199
for the cyber threat intelligence summit

141
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,880
is mind the assumption gap mind your

142
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
assumptions mind your biases and really

143
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
just ask with a caveat so being able to

144
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,960
think about when we look at some of the

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
statistics and realizing that no one can

146
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,759
read minds whether it's in cyber threat

147
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
intelligence or if it's in

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
just day to day with your personal lives

149
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,919
working with spouses friends colleagues

150
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
those kind of pieces mind that

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
assumption gap and that's even more

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
important for your producers and

153
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,280
consumers in the in the cti field

154
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
and just to keep this a little bit like

155
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,600
flapper term we all stink at feedback

156
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
we're all really bad at it no one no one

157
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
is

158
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,360
a

159
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
top-tier feedback person incremental

160
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
change is key for your uh yourself as a

161
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,919
producer or as a consumer and i'll have

162
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,360
some pieces of that

163
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
to think about and that really comes

164
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
down to that growth mindset for

165
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
producers and consumers where you're

166
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
opening yourself up a little bit on both

167
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
sides to let the other person know about

168
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
what you're thinking and how best to to

169
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,280
make everything better

170
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
so starting from a very basic level the

171
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
three main types of feedback that we

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
think about where we always say hey we

173
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
want feedback we love feedback we want

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,160
feedback

175
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
breaking down to the three main main

176
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,840
portions and i'll have the sources for

177
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
the books that are my top kind of go-to

178
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,919
resources but evaluation that's more

179
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,440
along the lines of your

180
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,199
end of your evaluations with your bosses

181
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,720
or vice versa

182
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,400
along the lines of testing and what we

183
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,840
think about from the common cti feedback

184
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,600
bucket uh that's really kind of the best

185
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
term that i can think about especially

186
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
for if you're taking the sam's 578

187
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
classes getting things into buckets this

188
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
is what kind of what we think about when

189
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,919
we say we want feedback so being able to

190
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
have that coaching when you're in a

191
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,960
producer-consumer relationship to say

192
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,759
hey when should i get this to you

193
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,440
when do you need it and what format

194
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
those kind of things that coaching is

195
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,039
really the main portion that we think

196
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,960
about and honestly everybody loves

197
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
appreciation everybody loves to be told

198
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
that that was really good that was uh

199
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,840
that was helpful and there's different

200
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
anecdotal pieces but those are the two

201
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
main buckets when you think at

202
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,919
feedback as a whole writ large and then

203
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,360
we'll go down into the next kind of

204
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
steps and break it down a little bit

205
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
further into the

206
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,440
kind of cyber threat life cycle

207
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,120
so i'm also a big fan of ron swanson and

208
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
parks and rec so i'll have some uh some

209
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
gifts and memes throughout the

210
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
presentation just to keep a little bit

211
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,639
light but honestly when you think about

212
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,199
the anecdotal feedback appreciation that

213
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,120
was good thanks that's that is useful

214
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,400
but it's not as useful as it could be

215
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
and we'll have a little bit more on the

216
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
example side as i go through the

217
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,759
different pieces here and one of my

218
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,280
favorites is you put

219
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
blood sweat and tears into a research

220
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
project a cyber threat intelligence

221
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
product research writing edits getting

222
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
lit up by your editors whatever it may

223
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,520
be and then you get a red with interest

224
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,080
or you hear absolutely nothing um it's

225
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,039
one of those things where it's really

226
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,440
frustrating but it's also we'll work to

227
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
better

228
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
ingest that and have better ideas of how

229
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,360
to how to deal with that and then

230
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,639
unclear just depending on if you don't

231
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,919
have the right metrics or the right

232
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,800
tools

233
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,039
to see that feedback and then the stuff

234
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,319
that we've always seen before the

235
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,800
non-substance off-base uh for example

236
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,479
hey garrett your talk was good today but

237
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,720
i hate your face and i hate indiana i'm

238
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
a purdue fan so i'm like okay i get that

239
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
but did you actually get something from

240
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
the actual presentation so things like

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,039
that where

242
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
these are kind of what we normally see i

243
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,199
think within the kind of cyber threat

244
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
intelligence realm and i'll be able to

245
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,879
show some other pieces of feedback which

246
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,479
i think are more helpful and really get

247
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,960
down to the specifics and helping both

248
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,638
the producer and consumer

249
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,400
so just having these two charts here

250
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,319
this is the traditional feedback the

251
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,759
feedback cycle within cyber threat

252
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,160
intelligence or intelligence and these

253
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
probably look familiar to most people

254
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
that are listening here today but i like

255
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
the the joint pub on the bottom left

256
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,479
with the feedback as a continuous part

257
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
of the cycle and i really like that

258
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
because it does happen when you think

259
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,080
about feedback and evaluation for

260
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,559
your planning your collection

261
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
exploitation when you think about

262
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
working and getting research ideas

263
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,599
working with your fellow analysts with

264
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,120
your colleagues you get feedback saying

265
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
hey that's not a good idea use this

266
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,399
source use this source

267
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,120
analysis and production everybody knows

268
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
you've been lit up by

269
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
all kinds of different editors

270
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
throughout your entire life saying hey

271
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
you forgot a period there don't space it

272
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,839
that way

273
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
you forgot the oxford comma may god have

274
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
mercy upon your soul things like that

275
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
where they keep you in check they make

276
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
sure it's a standard and that entire

277
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
feedback process is pretty

278
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
is uh is pretty um pretty constant

279
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
and then i really like um the

280
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,120
intelligence life cycle i'd like kind of

281
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
these both because when you look at the

282
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
intelligence cycle on the right from

283
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,480
recorded future and the original source

284
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
from group sense it shows feedback as a

285
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,360
true portion of that entire cycle and it

286
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
also talks about two-way communications

287
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
which i'll go into next but it's a

288
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
really good idea when you think about

289
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
from a larger feedback perspective and

290
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,640
what to do about it and some of my

291
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,160
recommendations here

292
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,519
you think about feedback as a true

293
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,959
portion of that cycle

294
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,880
think about all the personnel within the

295
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,720
cycle that you have for the larger cyber

296
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
threat intelligence production process

297
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,160
where you have your editors you have

298
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,480
your researchers you have your tools you

299
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
have all these people dedicated these

300
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
certain jobs and feedback is such a huge

301
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,519
portion of this

302
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
and sometimes we don't have the right

303
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
amount of staffing or personnel for it

304
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,279
and there's different pieces to that but

305
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,720
i think it's something to think about as

306
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
we go forward

307
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
for other cyber threat intelligence

308
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
teams when it comes down to pulling that

309
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
feedback together and

310
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,720
creating actions off of it

311
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,720
so going one step down and really kind

312
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,959
of hammering on the point of the two-way

313
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,839
feedback or sorry two-way street

314
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
uh within feedback so this threat

315
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,600
ravens.com is a really good threat

316
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
intelligence life cycle phases that i

317
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,560
sourced here at the bottom and i have at

318
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
the end of the product

319
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,279
but basically looking at the cyber

320
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
threat intelligence producer standpoint

321
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,839
that dark blue box in the center and i

322
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,160
highlighted in red very simple

323
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,600
graphics

324
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
bi-directional feedback for these

325
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
producers and these consumers so you can

326
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
see the bi-directional arrows and that

327
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
goes from if yourself if you think

328
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
yourself inside that actual dark blue

329
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
box inside of threat intelligence you're

330
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
producing intelligence to your ir your

331
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,200
sock teams your tactical level personnel

332
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
also on the strategic side with your

333
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,079
leadership fraud management risk

334
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,240
analysis and it's bi-directional so

335
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
you're getting feedback they're giving

336
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
you feedback and that's more along the

337
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
lines of that coaching and appreciation

338
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
but one of the things i think we

339
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
we don't think about as much is think

340
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,880
about that producer that's one level

341
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
removed so think about your sources

342
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
think about for example if you're at a

343
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
vendor or an intelligence shop think

344
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
about your

345
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
your primary sources your secondary

346
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
sources think about the people who are

347
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
updating

348
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
the products and pieces that you have

349
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,640
within your tools within your systems

350
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,480
people are doing all the the back end

351
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
work on the databases and the

352
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,800
forward-facing guise for your products

353
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
or tools think about those people as

354
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
well because everyone thinks if you're a

355
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
producer you're always thinking oh man i

356
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
don't get enough feedback i don't know

357
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,880
what's i don't know what's exactly

358
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
happening i don't know if they actually

359
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,120
use this

360
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
think about that but one more layer

361
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
removed for those people that are doing

362
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
a lot of this back end work

363
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
they have almost no idea sometimes of

364
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,720
how

365
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,480
any of their tools are being used or

366
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,399
even if you're using them so i think

367
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,640
thinking about that in a larger sense so

368
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
if you're in that middle section you're

369
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
in kind of that traditional

370
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,920
cyber threat intelligence role

371
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
speaking with customers providing things

372
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
for customers also think about the

373
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,079
people that are helping you produce what

374
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,160
you produce so that producer one level

375
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
removed i think is absolutely key but it

376
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
comes down to completing that feedback

377
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
life cycle

378
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
and really empowering the people that

379
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
help you produce and then

380
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
producing an even better product for

381
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,320
your

382
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
for your customers so i think that's one

383
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,279
of the big things that i think we really

384
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,880
don't think about much i think it's

385
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
worth highlighting here and i really

386
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
like this graphic with

387
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,079
some of my very simple just highlights

388
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,399
when we look at feedback as a whole

389
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,839
inside of this larger cycle

390
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,920
so going kind of the next step and we

391
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,680
talked about it before where

392
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,519
no one is good good at feedback it's

393
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,160
hard but at the same time i took a

394
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,720
snapshot from the sans 2021 cti survey

395
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
for measuring effectiveness and there's

396
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,760
multiple different ways to do it but i

397
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
highlight just looking at requesting

398
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,639
feedback

399
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,720
on performance from cti

400
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
consumers so that was only 40 percent of

401
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
respondents said yes they do that so

402
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
looking at that you see 60

403
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,920
don't request feedback and there's a lot

404
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,320
of nuance and other pieces to this but

405
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
it's one of those things where you don't

406
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,279
know if you don't ask

407
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,880
and then i always say as with anything

408
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,920
we think about with several third

409
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,279
intelligence there's a caveat or there's

410
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,399
context so asking but so asking but

411
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,320
being specific and being specific i

412
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
think is one of the key takeaways

413
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,639
for anything feedback related don't just

414
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,839
ask for feedback don't ask for

415
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,120
hey how was our program you've been with

416
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,839
us for five years being very specific

417
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,000
with your feedback ask i think is really

418
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
really key so one of those pieces that

419
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,279
you can kind of take away and what i

420
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,360
think about is kind of an easy way to

421
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,839
think about it is bite size chunks with

422
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,600
bite-sized groups and i realize i'm

423
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,839
talking to now thousands of people and

424
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
hopefully even more will listen to this

425
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
recording

426
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
but thinking about bite-sized groups to

427
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
get the feedback that you're looking for

428
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
as a kind of traditional cyber threat or

429
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,720
intelligence producer

430
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
is think about if you're a

431
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
someone on say the the tactical or

432
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,639
technical side and you're a it messaging

433
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
person and you're getting a briefing

434
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,519
on from a vendor or from your producer

435
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,920
and it's 100 people on the briefing and

436
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
your boss and your boss's boss are on

437
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
that briefing

438
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
you're probably not going to give the

439
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,760
feedback that that producer wants if

440
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
they say hey does anybody have any

441
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,240
questions

442
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
is there anything wrong with this um

443
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,760
with that level of forum you're probably

444
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
not going to have someone that technical

445
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
level be like hey garrett yeah that was

446
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
really good or can we talk a little bit

447
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,920
more about this or

448
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
that was completely wrong you suck at

449
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,839
everything you do

450
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,199
and it's very different levels of

451
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,320
feedback but it's just something to

452
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,920
think about where someone is going to do

453
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,519
that most likely in front of their

454
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,680
bosses or in front of that larger quorum

455
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,639
so having that smaller bite-sized group

456
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
for some of these things ways to get

457
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,560
feedback i think is absolutely key and

458
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,079
you can't always have a small group but

459
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
kind of working towards that and getting

460
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,839
those different

461
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,000
buckets of say like your security teams

462
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
your i.t messaging

463
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,519
your training teams and breaking them

464
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,360
into the normal well we could see a

465
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,680
strategic operational and tactical

466
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,199
customers is something great to think

467
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,959
about to really have those bite-size

468
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
groups to get that bite-sized

469
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,199
chunk of feedback

470
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,800
from your from your customers or your

471
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,359
consumers

472
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
and really when we talk about being

473
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
specific to i think when you think about

474
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
the asking for feedback and knowing

475
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
what's good again no one being good at

476
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,519
it i think it's something to to think

477
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,800
about as well

478
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
is having some of the the backups for

479
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,399
your briefings and planning and planning

480
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,440
that and being specific so being

481
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,360
specific for yourself too and i'll go a

482
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,639
little bit more into that as well but

483
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,240
with your briefings think about having

484
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,519
that time

485
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,199
for feedback think about having that

486
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,440
time for that that post talk so it's

487
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
something like this for sam's luckily we

488
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
have this

489
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,079
slack channel in the workshop and

490
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,440
there's my pieces afterwards for people

491
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
to follow up with me but this is one of

492
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
the hard things about zoom about teams

493
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
about these virtual environments that

494
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
you don't have that time where you can

495
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,399
go grab cocktails with somebody

496
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,000
afterwards and talk more and more about

497
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,759
this and have that feedback and get that

498
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
that one-on-one interaction so i think

499
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,920
it's important to plan that within your

500
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,000
briefings if you can and be specific

501
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
about kind of how you present

502
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,320
and plan that time out with your with

503
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,519
your customers and consumers

504
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,199
so everyone knows uh

505
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,720
within the cyber threat intelligence

506
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
fielder likely knows or have heard about

507
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,000
the the pyramid of pain from david

508
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,800
bianco i think was back in 2014 that he

509
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,199
he first did this i created just a

510
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,920
simple pyramid of pain but for feedback

511
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
so it all starts with him and his

512
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
mindset of the pyramid of pain and

513
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
looking at

514
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,519
hashes iocs ttps and how that gets

515
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,600
progressively harder i'm trying to think

516
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
the same way and provide a snapshot for

517
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,160
everyone listening here from a feedback

518
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
perspective of thinking about techniques

519
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,560
that start from the easiest way to do it

520
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
going up to very much the

521
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,720
uh the hardest when it comes down to

522
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,000
inputs for time effort and energy

523
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,240
so an email alias again it's very very

524
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,079
simple when you think about it but you

525
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,519
see it on scissor products you see on

526
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,560
fbi

527
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,959
probably a lot of your vendor or other

528
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
producer products having a simple email

529
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,320
alias that you can respond back and even

530
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
if it's just saying hey that report was

531
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,599
that poor report was great uh

532
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,439
so and so details that's really helpful

533
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,039
because it just it starts the process it

534
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,240
starts the process of being able to

535
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,839
receive that feedback and it's right

536
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,760
there at the end of a product at the

537
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,359
beginning of a product

538
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
i recommend putting it if you can at the

539
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,720
at the front and at the beginning

540
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
sometimes if it's an executive customer

541
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,679
as an example

542
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,839
they might not make it down to page five

543
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,679
page six or page twenty if you get to

544
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
that level of product

545
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,720
so if they see that they like the

546
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,160
executive summary they'd like a piece

547
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
they can respond back more quickly

548
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,720
so that's kind of the easiest and then

549
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
going one level up we look at emails and

550
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,760
surveys

551
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,799
so

552
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,160
when we talk about email and surveys

553
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
again be specific that's one of the

554
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,200
pieces that is a constant piece i talk

555
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
about here but it is it is it rings true

556
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,280
throughout the entire pyramid and really

557
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
throughout the entire feedback kind of

558
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
mindset is that being specific with

559
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
emails so asking someone for

560
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
feedback on a product ask them about

561
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,400
specific like okay did the iocs in this

562
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
format work for you do you need another

563
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,799
format you can ask about timelines

564
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,440
specifically you can ask specific things

565
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
about maybe the executive summary was

566
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,720
that in the right place things like that

567
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
when it comes down to very specific

568
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,320
pieces that you need to know to be able

569
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
to tailor those products even better and

570
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
then surveys again

571
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
sans is awesome with this especially

572
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
during this

573
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,679
this entire

574
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,600
uh summit and training is that they have

575
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
those surveys at the end of every

576
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
every uh talk and it's really nice too

577
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
because when you think about surveys i

578
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,440
feel like

579
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
i feel like a lot of

580
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
people companies

581
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,960
producers and consumers will send out a

582
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
survey basically

583
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,760
touchdown you can

584
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
spike the football in the end zone

585
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
you're good to go i think you really

586
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
have to think about following up and

587
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
it's not to be annoying just follow up

588
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,400
and say hey

589
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
every single day like asking someone to

590
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,840
photo survey for you don't do that but

591
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,480
following up and saying hey so-and-so

592
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,559
consumer customer i just want to let you

593
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,320
know that we sent a survey let them know

594
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,559
first off because as with everybody

595
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,240
knows you get probably hundreds if not

596
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
thousands of emails a day from different

597
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
people you're getting pulled in multiple

598
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,720
directions

599
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
your kid could be trying to to bother

600
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
you at the same time so being able to to

601
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,880
tell your consumers or customers saying

602
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,280
hey the survey came at this date at this

603
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
time being specific and following up

604
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
with them so say you're in a meeting

605
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
they can go in that meeting and find

606
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,039
that directly and it saves them time

607
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,440
effort and energy to provide that

608
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,200
feedback that you want via the survey

609
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,360
going one level up and

610
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,720
looking at briefings and face-to-face

611
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,160
communications obviously this is a lot

612
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,039
more

613
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,400
difficult you have to have the right

614
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,840
personnel it requires a lot of

615
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,360
coordination as everybody knows trying

616
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,760
to schedule zoom in teams meetings or

617
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
other meetings on a virtual or even

618
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,919
face-to-face scale is very difficult

619
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,520
when you look at agendas

620
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
again being specific thinking about

621
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
agendas where

622
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,440
you can kind of give that that heads up

623
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
to your consumer

624
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
or your customer to let them know hey

625
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,320
this is what i like to talk about i want

626
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,840
to talk about getting feedback on these

627
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,080
pieces because if you think about it say

628
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,200
you're in an internal meeting and

629
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
someone says

630
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
hey garrett give me that i want you to

631
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
brief right now on this or i want you to

632
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,559
give me that information right now it it

633
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,640
takes you it takes you back a second

634
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,000
you're caught off guard you might not be

635
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
real happy about it think about that

636
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,600
from a customer or consumer standpoint

637
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,039
you want to be able to give someone for

638
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,960
a warning let them know what you'd like

639
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
to talk about so it's not because you

640
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
never know and that's something too when

641
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,000
we think about this i think about all

642
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
the people watching today i wouldn't

643
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,120
want to just call someone out and say

644
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
hey can you do this this and this for me

645
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
um you're probably dealing with kids

646
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,200
pets everything else working from home

647
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
uh it could be it could be midnight your

648
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,440
time right now who knows so being able

649
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,039
to have that agenda i think is really

650
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,200
key and being specific with that i think

651
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
is absolutely crucial and again that

652
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
just takes more time

653
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,120
it takes more effort and more inputs of

654
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,480
time and energy so that's why it's kind

655
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,559
of one level up for me

656
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,840
you know with the briefings of face face

657
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
communications just to highlight too i

658
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,440
think you look at

659
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,880
being able to plan that time so i'm not

660
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
i'm getting better and better with it

661
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,360
but i think having that time to take

662
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,559
that pause

663
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,799
and if i were to be in an open forum

664
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,000
today i would take that pause and say

665
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,039
hey do we have any any ideas about this

666
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,720
do you disagree with this being able to

667
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
take that time to allow

668
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,640
yourself to take a breath as a briefer

669
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,679
but also

670
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,120
allowing the customer to say hey i have

671
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
a question about this i have a question

672
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
about this i think it's something to

673
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
really plan into your entire planning

674
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
process with these briefings these

675
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
face-to-face communications and it's

676
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,080
more difficult but it's more things to

677
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
think about and that kind of leads into

678
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
the next step where

679
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,520
i was between putting a dedicated

680
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
feedback person or personnel and

681
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,039
switching that with grievancing

682
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
face-to-face communication and it kind

683
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
of ties in well but i think it's even

684
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
more difficult where everyone knows here

685
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
that talent

686
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
in the cyber security field is something

687
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
that is always lacking and when you look

688
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,360
at the cyber threat intelligence field

689
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,960
sometimes you just don't have the amount

690
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
of people to do this but i really think

691
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
it's crucial to you just have a

692
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,880
a part-time duty an additional duty or

693
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,720
an additional um

694
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
whether it's a

695
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
um additional offering for that person

696
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
whether they're a full-time analyst or

697
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,440
if they're doing something else at the

698
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,280
back end to have that dedicated feedback

699
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,919
person to to pull everything together to

700
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,120
make sure that people are listening the

701
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,720
right feedback you have these parts of

702
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
the pyramid already kind of set up

703
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,480
and really again just kind of thinking

704
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
about that when conservatory

705
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
intelligence as a true part of the life

706
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,400
cycle

707
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
and kind of treat it as such and this is

708
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,240
going to be a more mature program and

709
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
higher up the uh the pyramid but it's

710
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
something to think about as having that

711
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,559
dedicated person for that dedicated

712
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,720
slice of that uh

713
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,480
of that life cycle

714
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,080
and then lastly at the very top of the

715
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
pyramid growth mindset uh that comes

716
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
down to

717
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
building off of everything you have here

718
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,600
inside of this pyramid but also thinking

719
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,480
about

720
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,640
it comes down to building trust between

721
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,159
the consumer and producer and honestly

722
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,799
that takes a lot of time effort energy

723
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,039
and it takes a lot of things to to go

724
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,280
right along with having these virtual

725
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
meetings creating that that relationship

726
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
that takes a long time and that's why

727
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,799
it's up at the top for me and it's built

728
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,159
upon everything else but that's what

729
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,080
everybody strives for within that

730
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
producer and consumer relationship

731
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
so from that perspective there's a lot

732
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
of different pieces in there little

733
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,280
nuggets i think that are that are good

734
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,039
takeaways when it comes down to if

735
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,000
you're listening and you're in a

736
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,679
consumer

737
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,080
consumer seat think about communication

738
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,600
and taking a little bit of extra time so

739
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
we talked about the assumption that the

740
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,799
assumption gap is real and that's not

741
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,960
just for producers consumers here just

742
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
in the little bubble of cyber threat

743
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,880
intelligence it's it's in everyday lives

744
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
for you think about your spouse your

745
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,960
partner your friend your colleague no

746
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
one knows what you're thinking no one

747
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,159
can remind and that's very much the same

748
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,880
with consumers so being able to

749
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
create that trust and let

750
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
as a consumer let your producer know

751
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,200
that

752
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,159
hey this is my timeline this is my needs

753
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,080
i'm able to see this i'm able not to see

754
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
this i don't need this where that

755
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
negative feedback just seems a little

756
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,240
bit

757
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
callous but it's it's absolutely helpful

758
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,600
and useful

759
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,080
for your producer because you just you

760
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
don't you don't know unless uh unless

761
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,520
someone tells you or if you again you

762
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
can't read minds and taking a little bit

763
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,679
extra time so this is where helping your

764
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,600
producers produce which is a little bit

765
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,080
repetitive but it really comes down to

766
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,600
for your top producers for the stuff

767
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
that you really love and that you can't

768
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,200
live without if you haven't told someone

769
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
about that if you haven't given that

770
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,600
appreciation you haven't given that

771
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
feedback make sure to do that because

772
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,559
you don't want to have your best

773
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,520
producers lose their jobs lose their

774
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,799
positions

775
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,919
it's one of those things where taking a

776
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,760
little bit extra time is really helpful

777
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,200
and on the flip side i know people are

778
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,520
probably saying well i can't give

779
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
feedback 24 7

780
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,120
and do it every single night of the week

781
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
and think about it from like an amazon

782
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
purchase perspective if you if you gave

783
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,559
feedback to every single vendor on

784
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,600
amazon

785
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,279
it would be a full-time job but thinking

786
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,080
about those those best people those best

787
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,520
producers and taking a little bit of

788
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,080
extra time again just kind of planning

789
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,360
thinking about it in your mind and

790
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
taking that time to provide that

791
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
feedback i think is something that's

792
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
worthwhile even just putting in

793
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,640
15 minutes in your calendar

794
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
once a week to provide feedback on

795
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,159
products you ingest those kind of pieces

796
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,080
i think it's a it's a great opportunity

797
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
to do that and to plan that into your

798
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
schedule

799
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,679
looking at the producer we talked about

800
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,200
multiple feedback vehicles you can have

801
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,279
everything from traditional informal

802
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,799
and formal and then also i think one of

803
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,480
the things that most people think about

804
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,640
is also feedback by proxy so having that

805
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,320
second hand information

806
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
whether it's working through one of your

807
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,080
sales personnel or

808
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,279
one of your colleagues or friends that

809
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,559
has a better relationship with the

810
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,000
actual consumer

811
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
always feel free to use that it's a

812
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
great way to start it's not 100 it's not

813
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,559
that direct feedback that direct trust

814
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,960
but it's a way to build that and we've

815
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
already talked about the formal and kind

816
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,559
of traditional pieces and don't don't

817
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,840
count out just having cocktails and

818
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
conversations with your with your

819
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,760
consumers um or your friends who might

820
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
have a relationship with that consumer

821
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,360
and we've already hit this point but

822
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,559
feedback is a true section of

823
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,480
intelligence and having that full or

824
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,240
part-time person if you can

825
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,080
centralizing those findings and thinking

826
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,520
about that assumption gap which goes

827
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
both ways for producer

828
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,000
and consumer

829
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,679
and this is the other version of ron

830
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
swanson for parks and rec and again

831
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,240
these are specific short

832
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,840
examples but basically you can have

833
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
great info splunk rules implemented it's

834
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
specific it's short it tells the

835
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,679
producer how it was used and it couldn't

836
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,279
be negative feedback saying hey garrett

837
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,520
we completely missed the mark where it's

838
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
really late we need something in a

839
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,039
different time frame again people can't

840
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,159
read minds and it's really helpful

841
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,279
because then we can change and we

842
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,880
provide you a better product at a better

843
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,360
time so again

844
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,120
large theme of today's presentation keep

845
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,320
it specific

846
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
and

847
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
you'll you'll be in you'll be in a good

848
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
spot when it comes down to providing

849
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,159
that feedback and thinking about it on a

850
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
grander scale

851
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,480
so to conclude everything when we think

852
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,559
about just the larger perspective

853
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,480
everyone is human flawed and we all suck

854
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,720
at feedback and it's meant to be a

855
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,679
little bit funny and hopefully kind of

856
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,720
get you out of your chair a little bit

857
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,480
basically working towards a growth

858
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,080
mindset is one of the biggest things we

859
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
think about from a producer and consumer

860
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,200
relationship

861
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,720
and it seems very lofty but that's

862
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,320
that's the larger goal that we see as

863
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
being the top of that pyramid

864
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,919
consider feedback as a true section of

865
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,600
the intelligence life cycle it's part of

866
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
the maturation process

867
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,360
think about different ways to elicit

868
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,760
feedback um if you're a producer talk

869
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,600
with your consumer and vice versa it's a

870
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,360
two-way street there's multiple ways to

871
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
do it and again not everybody needs a

872
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,919
tesla sometimes a minivan or work or for

873
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,520
myself a an old 2009 rogue is perfectly

874
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,840
fine for myself as an example and then

875
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
mining the assumption gap and

876
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,559
communicate not everybody knows what

877
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,760
you're thinking

878
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,000
same thing with your spouse partner best

879
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
friend and just ask with the caveat and

880
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,760
be be specific be specific with

881
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,600
everything you do and think about it

882
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
more as part of the the natural planning

883
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,440
process

884
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,480
so i appreciate everybody's time today i

885
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,840
want to give thank you it's just in

886
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
general because it's a feedback

887
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
presentation and uh

888
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,279
obviously i obviously have to do that

889
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,720
and i just wanted to highlight a lot of

890
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
the people that have really helped me

891
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,919
along the way the proof point team allen

892
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,559
ferdinand email security guru just a

893
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,640
great great human being selena larsen

894
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
and josh miller two great analysts that

895
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,320
are part of our larger threat research

896
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,480
team and the larger proof point for

897
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
information service that we have at

898
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
proofpoint which has been supremely

899
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,159
helpful to me on my maturation process

900
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,760
as an analyst

901
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
and when i talk about the other portions

902
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
that i've kind of got me to where i'm

903
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,480
here now um the dragos team as a whole

904
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
the sands 570 class was absolutely

905
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,320
crucial for me i was lucky that i was

906
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
able to get it um

907
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,399
through my reserve duties uh joe

908
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,919
sloick's operational threat intelligence

909
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,240
class is a great one and then sergio's

910
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
diamond model which has been referenced

911
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,399
here and is referenced really um

912
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,760
probably in every single presentation

913
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,919
also his blogs about personal uh

914
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
personal and mental health i think were

915
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,000
incredibly helpful to me

916
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
as a whole

917
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,799
i talk about my government team members

918
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,919
and

919
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,520
the ways that i've worked in the cyber

920
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,159
threat field as a whole uh prior to

921
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,240
proof point again thank you to everyone

922
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,799
there the editors that want editors that

923

hit me multiple times about some of the

925
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
stupid things that i do with my writing

926
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
identifying my bias keeping me in check

927
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480

threat intelligence field creating those

949
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,840
resources they're absolutely helpful for

950
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,640
me

951
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,200
and uh honestly just two great people in

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,520
time and kind of start this conversation

957
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,840
about feedback which i think is crucial

958
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
uh for the entire cyber threat

959
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,799
intelligence kind of apparatus

960
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,360
and sources uh one of the one of the

961
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
lesser known pdfs what the intelligence

962
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
community doesn't know is hurting the

963
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,159
united states i think is a great one

964
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
thanks for the feedback feedback and

965
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,200
other dirty words and let's talk are

966
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,960
kind of my three go-to resources for

967
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
books and then i will get more

968
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,600
information there's a uh there's a

969
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,200
feedback talk from some minion and

970
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,279
formerly fire eye personnel i'm trying

971
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,559
to find more information about that but

972
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,159
that's another great resource they go

973
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,760
into a whole other level of technical

974
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,679
detail with this piece and i hope to

975
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,679
work with them in the future and

976
