1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,480
i'm excited about our next presentation

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,400
because these are two folks who know a

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
lot about ransomware

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,880
i've worked firsthand with kroll looking

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,640
at ransomware intrusions and i can say

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,119
lori tony and a lot of folks over there

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,600
really know their stuff and i'm

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
particularly excited about this topic

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,279
and this talk because

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
ransomware of course such an important

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
topic i would argue one of the threats

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,359
that every organization needs to worry

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,239
about but i think we so often hear about

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,680
the big names

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
are evil or conti

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,719
and there are a lot of different types

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,719
of ransomware operators and so i'm

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
particularly excited to hear from lori

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,239
and tony about maybe a slightly

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,079
different take on ransomware that you've

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,440
heard before

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
with that lori tony take it away you

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
should have slide control but i'll hang

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,640
out until you confirm that

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
awesome thanks katie

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,520
um so as katie said oh my name is laurie

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,400
icono i'm a senior vice president with

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,479
kroll cyber risk

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,200
i manage the day-to-day of our cyprus

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
right intelligence team

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
um so i work very closely with instant

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,280
response folks like tony um and i do a

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
lot of kind of looking across our cases

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,119
to try to identify

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,040
you know strategic trends or threats

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
that we should notify our clients of

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
um so i'm a former english major

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,400
so i'm one of those humanities people

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,079
that made their way into cyberspread

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,040
intel um i really enjoy reading so if

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,680
you have some uh favorite cyber security

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
book recommendations be sure to leave

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
those for me in the slap chat and i also

44

teach

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
cyber crime and

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,439
cyber intelligence at university of

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,000
pittsburgh and robert morris university

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,119
and i'll let tony introduce himself next

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,840
greetings everyone my name is tony

knutson coming from you from the very

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,439
cold minneapolis minnesota

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,000
a little bit about my background i've

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
been doing this about 10 years inside

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
digital forensics inside all of the

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,320
major sectors

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,199
federal law enforcement private sector

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
academia and obviously with consultancy

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
here at kroll

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,000
i am a bit of a cert hoarder i am a 1099

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
sme for the

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
digital forensics classes for sans so

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
i've had the luxury of being able to

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
work with a lot of the instructors over

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
the time

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
and this is obviously a very big passion

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,239
of mine is with threat intelligence

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,680
we're really hoping that you enjoy this

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,680
talk

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
yes so our talk today is lone wolf's um

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
how ransomware has evolved into

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,920
freelance work

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
and for our uh agenda this afternoon

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
what we're going to do is we're going to

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
talk a little bit about

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,640
kind of like a history lesson

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,959
on ransomware as a service we're also

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,080
going to talk you know about

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
specifically what we see in kroll and

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,120
how all of the like ransomware as a

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,879
service activity has kind of set the

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,519
stage for uh a type of actor that tony

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,159
and i are kind of calling the lone wolf

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,560
um and then after i'm done then tony

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
will go into more of like ir case study

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
of example of our team

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
uh working together very closely with ir

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,560
to uncover some intel uh related to kind

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
of an unknown actor and as well as some

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,760
key takeaways at the end

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
so tony if you want to go to that next

91
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,640
slide um so this slide here uh this is

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
just representing kind of the total

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
percentage of different threat incident

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
types that we see um in our ir cases

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
that crawl so that top uh navy blue line

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,840
that's representing ransomware and

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
except for q1 when we kind of had an

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
anomaly because of how many like

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,040
exchange proxy logon cases we saw uh

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
typically ransomware where it is by far

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
you know takes up the most percentage of

102
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,080
our ir cases and if we move over the

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,599
next slide now um it's actually been

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,680
that way since about august of 2019

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
and it was in august like it wasn't that

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
we didn't have ransomware before that

107
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
right um we always had that um it's just

108
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
that we had a smaller percentage of it

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
we usually would have more things maybe

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
like email compromise uh but in august

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
2019 we kind of saw the first time it

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,918
was the shift and ransomware and it's

113
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
pretty much stayed consistently like

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,960
that um since that time so that's about

115
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
three years now um and you know a lot of

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,840
what we have seen with that um

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,199
you know is these groups that are

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
operating this ransomware as a service

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
model um and for those of you who may

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
not be as familiar with that model as us

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,680
who kind of you know live and breathe it

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,320
every day um essentially ransomware as a

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
service or razz is you know it's kind of

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
a business model for a ransomware gang

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
in which

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
the kind of top level operators may

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,199
focus on things like software

128
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
development and pr and management and

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,759
then they actually outsource the

130
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,320
distribution of the ransom ware to a

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
network of affiliates who then get a

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
percentage of that ultimate ransom um

133
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
and definitely what we've seen you know

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
across our cases is these are equal

135
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
opportunity attackers so we've seen you

136
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
know companies of all sizes reputation

137
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,600
sector and revenue hit be hit by these

138
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,400
type of groups um so if we go on the

139
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,639
next slide um we're kind of going to go

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,520
back in time for a minute to 2019 and

141
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
and some things that happened i

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
mentioned that shift happened in august

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
2019 and let's talk about something that

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,320
happened

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
a couple months before that uh which was

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
the retirement of the gan crab

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
phantom worker this was a very public

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
retirement um and at that time they

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,919
claimed that they had made over you know

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,039
two billion uh us dollars in 18 months

151
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,919
of their operation um and we we have no

152
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
i you know way to vet that claim about

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,199
how much money they made but i think the

154
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,520
takeaway there was a significant amount

155
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
of money was made during that time now

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,919
they maybe weren't the first group

157
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
um to you know use this ras model but

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,000
they were certainly the ones that kind

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,880
of popularized it to the

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,479
extent that we're seeing today so a lot

161
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,080
of the groups that have been following

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
since then have kind of copied uh the

163
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,960
model that they had put into place

164
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
so if we go over to the next slide

165
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,240
um this is talking so this is may's

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,759
ransomware group this should be familiar

167
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,919
to a lot of people so another kind of

168
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,520
you know history lesson with uh

169
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479
ransomware as a service is we've seen we

170
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,800
saw this uh you know

171
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
addition of new tactics in the past

172
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
three years that these groups are using

173
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,479
so it's no longer just encryption

174
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,560
it's um encryption there's also

175
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,919
exfiltration and then they're

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,319
threatening or are they are posting it

177
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,440
on their

178
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,759
actual controlled shaming sites

179
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,080
so may's news uh this was one of the

180
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,800
first sites to act or well maze was one

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,080
of the first ransomware groups to

182
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,479
actually carry this out um so may's news

183
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,400
was one of the first sites in december

184
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
of 2019 um you know since then we've

185
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
kind of had a proliferation of this and

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,080
we definitely see this tactic uh being

187
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,360
used in our cases in 2020 we saw you

188
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
know

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
this tactic associated with about 40

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
percent of our cases and in 2021 uh that

191
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,720
statistic was about 90 of our cases

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
involved this kind of tactic

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,319
um so if we move over to the next slide

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
talk a little bit about you know some of

195
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,479
the the other tactics um so they're not

196
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,319
just doing the exfiltration and the

197
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,639
shaming sites um so we've seen things

198
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,720
like threatening ddos during

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
negotiations so avadon which is no

200
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
longer active and sun crypts they were

201
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
two of the groups that did that um as

202
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,919
well as you know but even as recently as

203
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,479
like a couple weeks ago we saw a pretty

204
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,000
like i think it was like a 10-day

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
sustained denial of service attack on

206
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
one of our uh clients uh during some

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
negotiations with black hat so that's

208
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,240
definitely a tactic that these groups

209
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,560
are still using a cold calling is

210
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,639
another one so during the negotiations

211
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,759
they'll

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,759
call employees maybe checking to see if

213
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,160
they got the ransom note or you know

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,599
pressuring them to uh pay the ransom um

215
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
as well as these emailing uh vic like

216
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,400
customers of the victim so this

217
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
example here on the right side this is

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
by the clock ransomware group and they

219
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,560
were basically going after customers of

220
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
a victim thinking that if the customers

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
are worried that their data is going to

222
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,520
be

223
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,440
put up on one of these shaming sites

224
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
they may pressure that victim

225
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,639
organization into paying that ransom so

226
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,240
one of the interesting things you know

227
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
we're seeing in the ransomware ecosphere

228
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,080
on the dark web is you know there's a

229
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,839
lot of services now so they've kind of

230
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,120
run out they're using all these

231
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,958
different tactics and there's a lot of

232
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,720
groups that maybe are specializing in

233
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
these kind of tactics so there may be a

234
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
group that's providing the ddos or group

235
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
that's providing the cold calling and

236
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
the fraudulent call centers

237
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
and basically you know all these

238
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,399
different services are kind of catering

239
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
to those ransomware as a service

240
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
operators but what that means is that

241
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
other threat actors can then take

242
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
advantage of them

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
so on the next slide

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,360
uh initial access broker so that's

245
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,519
probably um you know that's definitely

246
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
one of the the growth areas that we've

247
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
seen on the underground on catering to

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
these razz operators

249
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
and essentially here we have you know a

250
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,519
an image from an auction page and

251
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
they're basically selling off validated

252
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,760
credentials to you know different vpns

253
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,839
through foster care citrix things like

254
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,399
that um and and how we kind of see that

255
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,360
in our cases is a lot of times

256
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
if we find patient zero for the

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,720
ransomware uh incident then if you look

258
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,440
you know maybe two months six weeks back

259
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
you'll see one kind of unauthorized or

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
suspicious login to that account that's

261
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
probably the initial access broker doing

262
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
kind of the first test

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,160
and then you won't see anything uh

264
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
happening this be kind of dormant and

265
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
then you see the actor who's actually

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
launching the ransomware

267
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,399
campaign actually comes in at that time

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,399
so this is definitely a tactic now like

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
i said even though they're catering to

270
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,200
the larger ransomware as a service

271
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,120
operations uh this is something that now

272
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
any fret actor can take easily take

273
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
advantage of

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,600
so if we look at the next uh slide here

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
i want to talk a little bit about

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
insider threats so you know when we

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
think about our organizations as our

278
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
organizations get bigger there's more

279
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
risk for insider threat right so think

280
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
about some of these ransomware as a

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
service operations you know we know that

282
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,760
they're operating you know they have

283
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
sometimes hundreds of different

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,560
affiliates and they have hundreds of

285
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
different now like suppliers that are

286
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
you know doing these kind of niche

287
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,279
services for them so it means that there

288
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
might be more people in the ecosphere

289
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
that are now and you know disgruntled or

290
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
maybe have a bone to pick with the

291
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
operators and for us from an intel

292
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
perspective that's

293
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,160
fantastic because that's all the you

294
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,000
know things that we can data mine for

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
for information

296
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,839
um that's not so good obviously for the

297
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,920
operators but sometimes the way we see

298
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
that play out is you know

299
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
maybe you know discord on the forums

300
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
between actors about lack of payment um

301
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
we also see sometimes you know source

302
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
code or things like that will be dropped

303
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,120
and as i said that's all great from an

304
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,399
intel perspective

305
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,160
uh this example here this is probably

306
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
one of the most kind of like high

307
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
profile examples of this insider threat

308
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
uh this was in august of 2021 uh

309
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,240
disgruntled conti affiliate basically

310
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,200
dumped um kind of what was like the

311
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,360
training manual that they would give to

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
uh conti affiliates to help them you

313
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,079
know basically like instructions on

314
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,519
lateral movement and privilege

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,920
escalation once they're in a system

316
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
and there was you know a lot of

317
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
information like i said that we could

318
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,399
mine um from this for you know intel

319
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,279
purposes uh but this is also a lot of

320
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
information now that you know maybe a

321
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
threat actor who uh wasn't good enough

322
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
to get hired as an affiliate

323
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
could then take this information and

324
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
have this blueprint and um there's kind

325
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
of a fun fact related to this uh

326
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
specifically

327
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
one of our interns when he was pulling

328
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
all this information down

329
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
there were a couple different conti

330
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,720
leaks around the same time and there was

331
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,399
a bunch of videos

332
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,160
and he actually found that a bunch of

333
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,639
the videos that conti was providing to

334
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
their affiliates were actually like it

335
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,519
was his

336
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
professor at college was doing these pen

337
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,240
testing how-to videos for an educational

338
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
platform and conti was actually sharing

339
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,959
those videos with their affiliates so um

340
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,040
he was able to go back to his professor

341
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,200
and tell him that he was doing he's

342
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,560
doing such a good job that he's actually

343
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
helping out cyber criminals so that's

344
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
kind of a weird story

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
um so on the next slide

346
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
um and this is actually the last one

347
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
that i'm going to talk to

348
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,399
but you know all of this kind of

349
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
decentralization that we're discussing

350
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,399
all of this kind of discord amongst the

351
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
groups and you know information that's

352
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
now out there um in the public sphere

353
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,880
about ransomware activity um this is all

354
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,120
kind of you know resulting in kind of

355
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
lowering the bar to entry for threat

356
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
actors so this is why we think we're

357
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
seeing this you know rise in these lone

358
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,800
wolf attackers so i guess the question

359
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,720
is like what what is the difference

360
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
right like what is why does it matter if

361
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
it's like a wrath affiliate hitting

362
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
hitting me versus uh um

363
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
you know lone wolf attacker so there's a

364
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
couple of reasons um you know from like

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,920
intel and defense perspective um you

366
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
know part of it is you know from the

367
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
intel side these kind of actors kind of

368
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,639
complicate things for us um it

369
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
definitely complicates attribution

370
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
because you have so many actors using

371
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
you know things with the same indicators

372
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,440
um so we you know had a case recently we

373
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,160
had like three different cases where

374
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
we were seeing almost identical

375
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,839
indicators and ttps across all the cases

376
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,440
and at least for two of them we knew

377
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
that it was

378
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
possible they were related because it

379
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,120
was

380
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,440
in the same family of ransomware

381
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
but for one of them it was a completely

382
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
different ransom note

383
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
now when our you know examiner team kind

384
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,839
of saw the similarities they said

385
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,199
you know they kind of felt like it was

386
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,120
probably very likely to be the same

387
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,160
threat actor but when we did uh you know

388
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
like a deep dive into all of that

389
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
information what we found was that

390
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,519
almost all the indicators and tools they

391
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,160
were using even down to like host names

392
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,959
were things that were easily um

393
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,720
for purchase out there on the dark web

394
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
so it didn't really you know mean just

395
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,199
because they had the same things that it

396
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,959
was actually the same thread actor group

397
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
so it definitely makes attribution

398
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,680
harder

399
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,560
um and then from a defense perspective

400
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,120
so i have the pyramid of pain here on

401
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
the slide and you know with the pyramid

402
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
of pain you're thinking of network

403
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,880
defense kind of in terms of how much

404
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,160
pain

405
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,639
it causes your adversary if you block

406
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
certain indicators right

407
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,800
um so it's really hard to block

408
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
indicators though when you don't know

409
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,040
what those indicators are right so for

410
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
the larger uh raz groups there's you

411
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
know they're they're operating at such a

412
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,959
high volume that there's a lot of open

413
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
source reporting that's out there in the

414
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,800
community so someone you know may be

415
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
able to know kind of what the conte

416
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,279
playbook is um and what that looks like

417
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,800
and then they can take the right

418
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
blocking and detection steps in their

419
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,680
network

420
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
but if you have a lone wolf attacker

421
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
that you're dealing with um you know

422
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,040
this may be the second time they've ever

423
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,600
launched ransomware um so

424
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
you don't really know the playbook that

425
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,519
they're going to come at you with and

426
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,440
you know that that kind of takes me to

427
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
my my next point about these little

428
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
actors um

429
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,399
tony and i were taught because we went

430
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
through a lot of cases kind of you know

431
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,800
going planning for this presentation

432
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
and you know one thing that we we were

433
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,240
kind of saying was um you know

434
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,759
typically when we when we're talking

435
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,959
about when was we're trying to think of

436
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,279
a lower like less sophisticated actor i

437
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,160
guess

438
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
um so sometimes there's a lot of damage

439
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,199
affiliated with these attacks so it kind

440
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,959
of came up with the analogy it's kind of

441
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,639
like putting out a candle with a fire

442
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,000
hose

443
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
so yeah they're gonna you know

444
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,759
launch the ransomware um or you're gonna

445
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,199
put out that candle but you're going to

446
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,040
leave a lot of damage in your way so

447
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
some of the things that we've seen are

448
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,480
things like

449
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
data deletion data destruction

450
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
you know tony's told me lots of stories

451
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,839
about systems being completely

452
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,680
fried after one of these actors gets

453
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
done with them

454
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
um and then there's also you know

455
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
there's there's a potential

456
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
um you know sometimes they will encrypt

457
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,759
the network

458
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
but actually like you know it can be

459
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
decrypted without purchasing their

460
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
decrypter um so their encryption

461
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,000
actually didn't work that well which is

462
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,639
a good thing but there's al also the

463
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,639
flip side where you could they could

464
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
actually encrypt the network but then

465
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,839
they don't actually have the right

466
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,040
decrypter

467
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,079
for that information so even if you pay

468
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,480
them the ransom uh that doesn't actually

469
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
mean that it's going to depress your

470
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
network um so just kind of knowing um

471
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
you know which one of these attackers is

472
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
hitting your system is really valuable

473
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
and kind of you know informing your

474
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,359
response process or next steps to this

475
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,480
so i'm gonna pass the torch over to tony

476
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,959
now and he's gonna talk more about um

477
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,799
more about some of the differences in a

478
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,359
case study from our ir practice

479
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
thanks lori uh so

480
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
shifting from the cti and going a little

481
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
bit into the ir world i feel like this

482
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
is something that will help

483
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,319
the greater community to kind of

484
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,760
understand if you've never been in an

485
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
incident response role

486
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
uh what the the mindset is uh and we'll

487
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,880
start with that very briefly even just

488
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,320
looking at the difference between a razz

489
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
and a lone wolf

490
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,120
from my perspective as an ir person

491
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,400
i see a razz as a conglomerate

492
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,520
enterprise

493
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
they have all the sections you would

494
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
imagine inside of a company they have a

495
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,360
finance division they'll have a pr

496
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,240
division they've got a it support

497
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
division when it comes to things it's

498
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
very structured when it comes to stuff

499
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,960
lone wolf's on the other hand you're

500
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,200
more than likely dealing with a one-off

501
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
maybe a low group of individuals that

502
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
are doing all of it

503
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
where that significant difference is

504
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
going to really hit

505
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,679
is

506
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
what like what it matters to them

507
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,559
and a lot of that comes down to how a

508
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,360
razz works compared to how the lone

509
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
wolves are going to work

510
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,960
razzes are looking at bigger fish they

511
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,000
will target many many companies but they

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,799
can specifically go and target larger

513
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,360
companies or larger entities based on

514
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
an assortment of different uh mechanisms

515
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
either via credential harvesting

516
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
themselves and selling it

517
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,640
or they go and find those larger

518
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,480
companies that they find a weakness in a

519
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
cve such as proxy logon

520
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,559
xero logon

521
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
where a lone wolf they're looking at it

522
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
as what can i do to move very very

523
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
quickly through this

524
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,440
and where that becomes

525
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
the big thing with lone wolves is

526
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
they're going to move without really

527
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
knowing what they're doing

528
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,480
and a lot of the attacks that they're

529
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
looking at

530
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
are very

531
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
novice

532
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,919
and how they

533
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,480
approach these um ransomware as the

534
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,559
service groups are going to be very

535
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
explicit and it is following a playbook

536
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
we saw that with conti when you get into

537
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
a lone wolf you really don't know what

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
you're going to get and that really does

539
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
become the the big difference between

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,160
these two

541
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,480
lori hit on it very very good on the

542
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,039
destruction of your your network if they

543
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,480
can get in and they have

544
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
no seeming ability to understand how

545
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,120
that encryption works they could

546
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
fry your network

547
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,919
without any intention to do so and you

548
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,840
mean you're really at a loss at that

549
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,880
point

550
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,320
they can't really help you with anything

551
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,000
you're obviously not paying it's not

552
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
good for them they kind of get upset

553
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,039
about that but they learned they move on

554
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,760
and for our case study

555
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
this was a group

556
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,480
that had an affection for horses

557
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,640
uh it was a little it was a little odd

558
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,880
for us when we saw that

559
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,559
but you know we kind of went with it

560
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,919
so the the big thing with this is uh we

561
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,840
had to break down silos

562
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
uh from an ir perspective

563
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
i'm looking to get to my my leadership

564
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,919
team or to my client everything they

565
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,159
need to be able to make sound decisions

566
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,760
quickly

567
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,919
that means i'm not really digging for a

568
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
lot of things that potentially could be

569
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,200
beneficial

570
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,679
but is it really what they need

571
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,760
and what we saw with this one uh

572
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,559
specifically is this was in the summer

573
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,360
of 2021 so still fairly recently

574
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,720
uh our iocs were very trivial

575
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
by that i mean mimikatz was on there

576
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
still named mimikatz the encrypter was

577
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
named encrypter.exe

578
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,720
we were not showing any signs of

579
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,360
exfiltration through log files or other

580
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
traditional digital forensic

581
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
techniques

582
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,039
from the ransomware extension it was

583
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,520
really odd we had never seen this in

584
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
horsewe trust extension

585
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,000
in any engagement before we were a

586
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,679
little just kind of taken back by that

587
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,880
the ransom note only really contained a

588
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,520
irc channel username and an email

589
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,760
address for them to reach out to

590
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
this really went against a lot of the

591
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
normal things that we would see with a

592
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
ransomware as a service group

593
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
where they're going to lay out specific

594
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,799
things that they want you to do here's

595
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,799
our shaming site so you can see that we

596
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,440
mean business here's our contact site so

597
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
you can get into the department with our

598
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,080
customer help so we can start the

599
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,320
negotiation phase

600
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,400
here's how much money we're looking at

601
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,919
with the default that they have put

602
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
inside of it or you know obviously that

603
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,000
may be coming down the road

604
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,760
that stuff was not inside of this at all

605
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
we could have really just left it at

606
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,039
that and

607
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,880
kind of gone with it however our

608
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
curiosity got the best of us

609
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,720
and we went and started looking at

610
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,679
things

611
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,559
with what lori's team was able to do was

612
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
pull back some of that information

613
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
that we were seeing a lot of the high

614
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
profile razzes starting to dissolve or

615
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,480
they were going into an idle mode due to

616
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
the bigger events that happened into the

617
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,240
early summer

618
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,799
months of the u.s uh with the colonial

619
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,520
pipeline and then with the the cassia

620
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,360
cassaya

621
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
exploit as well through our evil and

622
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,080
with dark side or dark matter and then

623
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
we had descent with conti coming down

624
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,159
that playbook was released i believe in

625
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,320
august of 2021 so a lot of this was kind

626
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
of going on

627
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
just before we started seeing this this

628
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,120
group kind of come into here

629
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
so what they did is they were able to

630
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,280
start just doing a lot of oscent

631
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,600
and they took those email addresses and

632
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,320
they took that icq number and they

633
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,679
started looking to see if they could

634
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,480
figure out who this person was

635
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
and this is what it looked like on the

636
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,720
actual icq

637
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
location if you were to do some of this

638
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,240
ocean they were able to find a

639
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
different name with that that we were

640
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,159
able to pivot on

641
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,640
from there the mail that was in here we

642
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,720
were able to take and link in later on

643
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,000
to virustotal into some other external

644
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,880
analyses that that email was found in

645
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,039
that we were starting to basically put a

646
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,320
picture together

647
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
on who this actor could have been

648
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,600
and really what it ended up coming down

649
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
to is

650
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
we found on some very shady russian blog

651
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,960
site uh that there's a genealogy website

652
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,799
i put the link down in here we'll have

653
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,840
it on

654
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,640
the last slide as well that allowed you

655
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,919
to show a genealogy of

656
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,880
these

657
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
encrypters based on heuristics and

658
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,440
commonality or code reuse inside of them

659
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
that started to link them

660
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,960
together and what we started to kind of

661
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,400
figure out and i'm kind of glad i have

662
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,559
the mouse on here is

663
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,200
we found that our horse guys

664
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,840
were actually being part of a parent

665
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,600
which was part of a parent which was

666
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,880
part of a phobos as the primary which

667
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,799
obviously goes back to the dharma as the

668
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,840
creator

669
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
of it so we were able to start to see

670
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,039
like okay

671
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,200
this is what it is so but we we need a

672
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
little bit more confidence than that and

673
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,080
this is where a lot more of your

674
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,840
security operation center kind of comes

675
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
in handy

676
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,720
and a lot of research from our cti team

677
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
what we're able to find out

678
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,159
and we'll have some of the

679
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
links here in a second is

680
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,400
a lot of these activities were actually

681
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
happening back in 2018 but it was very

682
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,039
very small and we couldn't see what was

683
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,200
going on with them because it was small

684
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
and these were type of activity that

685
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,039
weren't really happening united states

686
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,720
they're happening in other regions of

687
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
the world but as soon as some of these

688
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,440
affiliates most likely were starting to

689
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,000
get disgruntled or wanted more money

690
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,520
what better way than to go out on your

691
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,400
own in freelance

692
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,919
so we started to look inside the

693
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,039
technical considerations and this is a

694
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,559
screenshot of the strings of the

695
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,320
encrypter.binary as it was uploaded to

696
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,520
virustotal not by us but by some other

697
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,919
individual that was on there you can see

698
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,720
it's not encoded it's not obfuscated

699
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,799
it's not packed that is typically things

700
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,320
that we would see with ransomware as a

701
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
service because they have a whole

702
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,440
malware team that literally is

703
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
developing that stuff trying to make it

704
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,559
as

705
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,880
difficult as possible for anybody to

706
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,400
reverse engineer it

707
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,240
and when we take it and we put it up

708
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,880
against a x hamster with the guarantee

709
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,159
which was supposed to be the parent

710
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,840
group we can see that we have almost a

711
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,039
one for one coming across this

712
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,679
with how they are actually laying out

713
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,440
the attack from that binary

714
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
we ended up with a very good thing of

715
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,120
high confidence that all right like

716
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,960
we've got these two pieces inside of

717
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,840
there based on what we were

718
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,200
seeing and with that we were able to

719
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
show like okay we've got this too we

720
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,080
feel pretty confident about that

721
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
getting into phobos blackberry and

722
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,039
malwarebytes ended up having terrific

723
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,840
uh

724
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,080
write-ups of things that we were able to

725
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,679
demonstrate inside of those same

726
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,080
binaries from both those families that

727
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,000
were still being seen inside there a lot

728
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,480
of them are typically what you would see

729
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,039
and a couple other things but because it

730
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,960
same thing it was not packed it was not

731
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,240
obfuscated it at least led us to

732
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,960
a mild bit of confidence i wouldn't even

733
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,039
really say medium but we felt fairly

734
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,840
sure that we could at least say okay

735
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,240
we're not the only one that think this

736
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
blackberry almost i think flat out set

737
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
in there that this is phobos and they

738
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
actually had one of the horse uh

739
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,120
binaries that they actually analyzed

740
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
inside of there

741
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,919
so our big key takeaways to this

742
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,200
is

743
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,000
from an ir perspective giving your cti

744
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,240
team all of this information allowed us

745
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,039
to

746
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,320
give our leadership and our clients way

747
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,120
better information based on what it was

748
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,880
we started to feel a lot stronger on the

749
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,559
things that you needed to really be

750
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,919
strong about which would be data

751
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,840
exfiltration when it came to this it was

752
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,120
one of the only things that we really

753
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,279
couldn't prove or disprove based on the

754
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,679
forensic artifacts this allowed us to

755
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,600
have a bit more confidence when we were

756
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,000
talking with them to be like you

757
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,279
you really

758
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,039
don't need to worry too much about this

759
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,200
we're not seeing anything based on what

760
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,039
the binary was doing

761
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,640
to do any of that kind of stuff and

762
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
we're not seeing some of these other

763
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
forensic artifacts when it came to this

764
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,120
exfil and based on other reporting we're

765
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
not seeing anybody else indicate that

766
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
that is something to be worried about

767
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,399
so it was a

768
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,399
massive win-win to have our threat

769
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,080
intelligence and our incident response

770
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,960
teams actually working together uh on

771
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,399
that

772
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,559
and the last slide before the we get

773
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,799
into the references of what we've kind

774
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,640
of talked about inside of here this is

775
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,559
still something that's happening um on a

776
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,200
day-to-day basis this is the screenshot

777
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,679
to the end horse we trust binary that we

778
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,600
have in here analyzed last time it was

779
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,760
submitted was on the 4th of january so

780
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,880
just only a couple weeks before this

781
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,279
so these attacks are still happening

782
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,200
so it is something to just be aware of

783
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,559
when it comes to this you know you're

784
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,679
dealing with freelance individuals

785
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,720
that

786
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,159
you never know when they may hit

787
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,399
and lastly

788
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,279
if anyone needs to contact laura that

789
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,880
would be our contact info and

790
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,919
thank you so much for your time
