1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,879
i'm really excited about this one

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,160
because over the years in the space of

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,719
cta i think we struggled a little bit on

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,519
the strategic side and sometimes

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,880
connecting with their business partners

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
or business peers and things along those

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,279
lines so this talk here

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,600
is going to talk about strategic

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
roi but it's also going to have some

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,480
applications on the operational side

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
it's going to be around uh m a so let's

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
go ahead and bring bethany and aurelia

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,920

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
who are both on the intelligence team at

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
cargill and they're going to introduce

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,719
themselves they've got a slide uh for

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,160
that um

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
but bethany uh like me is a former us

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
all right hi everyone uh rick gave us a

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,438
little bit of an intro but we'll also

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,920
introduce ourselves here so i'm bethany

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
i'm the cyber intel manager here at

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,960
cargill

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,479
i've been with cargill for about four

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,560
years but like rick said previously i

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
was an army intel officer

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,479
i there i spent some time in the middle

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,680
east

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
most recently with special operations so

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
right now i live in minnesota with my

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,040
husband

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
two kids two dogs and a cat so

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,360
consequently i'm very tired

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,880
and there you can see an actual

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,119
representation of how much coffee i go

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
through in a week

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
so aurelia

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
it's true

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
so hey everyone i'm orelli rodriguez i'm

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,759

analyst with the air force as i'm sure

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
little creative with how to deal with

68
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
the pandemic myself so here you'll see a

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,239
picture of what i affectionately call my

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,680
new therapist

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
and i do feel i need to mention though

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
that i do take it pretty easy on the

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,879
so welcome everybody we're excited here

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,040
to talk about ocean

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,760
cool all right so um a little bit about

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
us so we are a team of four obviously

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
i'm the manager aurelia said she's a

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
strategic analyst we also have an

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,920
operational analyst mike you can see him

82
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
over in our hallway

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
he tracks current campaigns things like

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
nation states he loves criminal actors

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
you know you want to make his day ask

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
him about wizard spider

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
we also have a tactical analyst corey i

88
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
think he'll be showing up in our hallway

89
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
too so he manages our thread intel

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,480
platform

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,440
um everything ioc is really looking you

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
know more specifically at ttps and

93
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,920
behaviors and he's our main interface

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
with security teams like vulnerability

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
management and instant response and my

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
uh corey is also an army veteran so

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,840
right now all of us all four on our team

98
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
we're north america based but our

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
greater cyber security team is located

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
globally

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
all right so cargill

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
um we like to call cargill the greatest

103
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
company or the largest company you've

104
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
never heard of

105
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
so cargill is a 155 year old private

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
organization

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
we have 155 000 employees spread across

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,720
70 countries

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
we're the largest private company in

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,840
america

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
so primarily we're a food and ag company

112
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,439
we also have a financial and industrial

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,519
section of the company we have five

114
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,920
distinct businesses under our overall

115
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,239
organizational umbrella

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
um as you can imagine we're an integral

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
part of the global food supply chain so

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,400
our headquarters are based here in

119
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
minnesota and right now i think it's

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
something like negative 30 fahrenheit

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
with the windchill so if you're thinking

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,599
about like moving here or you know

123
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
tourism visiting

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,918
it's really lovely this time of year so

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
you know lots of good stuff to keep in

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,840
mind

127
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
all right if slides will move forward

128
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,520
that would be great

129
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
there we go all right so how did the

130
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,919
cyber intel team at cargill end up

131
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,280
getting involved in the mergers and

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,600
acquisition due diligence process

133
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
so really this started prior to my

134
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
arrival four years ago i actually came

135
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
in in aurelius position as the strategic

136
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
analyst but then the process wasn't

137
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
really well established

138
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
it had some struggles to identify what

139
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
information was important to the

140
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
business

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
and how we as a team reported that

142
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,040
information up to stakeholders

143
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
so we really kind of worked with us over

144
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,759
the course of a couple years we evolved

145
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,600
our processes

146
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
quite honestly we did a lot of trial and

147
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
error we cycled through different tool

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,919
sets and methodologies of how to use

149
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,039
those tools

150
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
um but frankly what helped us the most

151
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
were honest conversations with

152
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
stakeholders and that really shaped how

153
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
we thought about collection what we

154
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
collected and how we reported it

155
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,039
and also you know being able to

156
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,520
accurately identify and describe within

157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
a business context um the increased

158
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
cyber risks present in m a due diligence

159
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,840
this helped us you know better

160
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,919
illustrate to stakeholders

161
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,560
the need for an intel assessment

162
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
so um way back when originally this

163
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
started we were often notified days

164
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
before an m a deal was imminent you know

165
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
shockingly that's too late if you find

166
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
anything bad

167
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,520
um and in some cases even after a deal

168
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
was complete

169
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
so

170
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
honestly we just forged ahead you know

171
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,120
it took us a couple years we were just

172
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
consistent and we delivered timely

173
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,319
tailored concise and accurate reports to

174
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,720
our m a stakeholder um

175
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
this led that stakeholder to

176
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,280
successfully lobby on our behalf and now

177
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
our assessment is much earlier in the

178
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
due diligence process

179
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
um and also you know we have a really

180
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,000
close relationship now to that team and

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
they've decided to trust us with access

182
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
to additional restricted information

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
which previously we didn't have access

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
to

185
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
so now that information really helps us

186
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
with both our greater analysis and

187
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
additional pivots

188
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
all right so things that also helped us

189
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
communicate to stakeholders to help make

190
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,360
that good case for involving

191
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
cyber intel and m a um frankly high

192
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
profile open source stories in the media

193
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,840
no things were risk assessments either

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
weren't done or didn't

195
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
think to include digital asset

196
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,720
integration

197
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,440
so

198
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
we're not going to name names but

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
several years ago there was a large

200
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
hospitality chain that suffered a

201
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
massive data breach

202
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,639
and this came

203
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
after they had done an acquisition from

204
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
another hospitality trained partner

205
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,000
and they had previously had some

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,199
incidents

207
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
now had they perhaps you're not speaking

208
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,639
for them because i don't know the

209
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,720
details of that but that that stands in

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,800
you know pretty stark contrast to what

211
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
else is out there

212
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
that helped us illustrate to

213
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
stakeholders you know hey doing some

214
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,960
extra due diligence

215
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
ensuring that there are things that you

216
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
know we can identify

217
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,360
um

218
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,440
that might help you know stakeholders

219
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
shape how they think about this deal

220
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
process

221
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
you know and and cyber intelligence um

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
you know through this can also really

223
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
drive business revenue you know i think

224
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
this is one thing we don't always think

225
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
about but if we make accurate

226
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
assessments for growth opportunities and

227
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,639
are also able to mitigate risk um you

228
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,440
know within the context of m a that can

229
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,000
confirm claims or reveal new information

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
that may influence negotiations so you

231
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,479
know things like data breaches poor

232
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,080
patching

233
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,479
high profile employee online behavior

234
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,319
and dark web mentions for things like

235
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,720
you know creds for sale or access that

236
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,639
all helps you know stockpile the due

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,080
diligence teams toolkit for negotiations

238
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,319
um so that's a lot of information but if

239
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,759
we were going to boil it down there's

240
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,680
one thing that our team firmly believes

241
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
in um we believe that that cyber

242
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
intelligence is a unique discipline

243
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
and that this can complement traditional

244
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
m a risk assessments and overall provide

245
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,638
strategic value back to the business

246
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,159
all right

247
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,839
so i don't often like to read slides

248
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,279
verbatim but we think that these are

249
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
really important so you know we are here

250
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,519
to provide information that's relevant

251
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,760
and specific to the organization you

252
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,519
know we are helping enable business

253
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,600
leaders to make decisions about both

254
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
risk and opportunity

255
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,399
um providing context we are providing

256
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,120
context to the technological world

257
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
that our organization operates in you

258
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
know most importantly to secure things

259
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
like intellectual property and

260
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,519
competitive advantage

261
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,360
this next point's really important

262
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,080
everything we do needs to be repeatable

263
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
measurable sustainable and auditable

264
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,880
here our team just wrapped up a couple

265
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,959
of audits and i'll be very honest they

266
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,640
were fairly painless

267
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
you know why because we followed this

268
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,399
process we wanted to make sure that

269
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,240
everything we did was documented so when

270
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
asked for it it was already there

271
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
um and also from you know a team

272
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,000
efficiency standpoint

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
we need to make sure our work is

274
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
repeatable so anyone's out on pto you're

275
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
sick vacation a weekend your other

276
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
teammates can just follow through you

277
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,800
know you're not a single point of

278
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
failure

279
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
people are our greatest asset here we

280
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
invest in our people

281
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
and then finally my favorite and i think

282
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
the most important point here adapt or

283
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
adapt or die or risk being outsourced

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
um

285
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,120
you know here within our industry we

286
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
need to continuously adapt and flow in

287
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,040
the direction of our organization or we

288
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
risk being outsourced you know we're

289
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
going to become completely obsolete

290
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
you know like this guy in the picture

291
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
and his outfit and

292
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,079
his hardware there on the desk

293
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
all right

294
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
so

295
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,040
if you have a background in the

296
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,680
government ic or military the slide is

297
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
going to look really familiar

298
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,920
so we've obviously reworked the

299
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
traditional doctrinal intel cycle

300
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
and we've put it into words and

301
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,440
descriptions that better suit the

302
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
business and can help educate

303
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,160
stakeholders

304
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,040
you know

305
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,320
or people who just don't have a

306
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
background in ic military or government

307
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,800
so we feel that this really helps them

308
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
visualize the overall framework and um

309
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,360
shows them you know how we operate you

310
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
know what guides our thinking and and

311
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
how we uh attack projects so you know we

312
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,200
don't have the luxury of assuming that

313
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
everyone or stakeholders you know a know

314
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
what intelligence even is and then also

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,519
what it can do for them

316
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,440
um you know here i want to make a quick

317
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,519
side note and go back to lillian's talk

318
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
now our industry has a lot of veterans

319
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
myself the majority of our team

320
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,240
my boss their you know sister teams

321
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
around us within our greater cyber

322
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
security footprint

323
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
there's a lot of us i love it you know

324
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
makes me feel at home but we also need

325
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
to identify what lillian said and start

326
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
bringing in people with non-traditional

327
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
backgrounds into our industry you know

328
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
they can help us see things differently

329
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
and identify gaps you know that

330
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
inherently our own group think and bias

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,000
may not let us see um you know so this

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
frankly was one of them

333
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,279
i liked the doctoral intel cycle it made

334
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,200
me feel warm and fuzzy like oh yes i

335
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,839
also have ready you know jp 2-0 i know

336
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
where this came from but that didn't

337
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,480
work in the business so we had to

338
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,360
um identify that that was a bias

339
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
and we had to change it

340
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,959
all right so

341
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,920
jumping back into intel cycle um you

342
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,279
know planning and research you know in

343
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,720
the phases and if you're looking at the

344
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
icons we're going clockwise starting

345
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
from the top planning research

346
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,639
everyone gets that all right analysis

347
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,720
everyone thinks they get this

348
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
but a lot of times we see things missing

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
context and when you are organic to an

350
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,240
organization

351
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,639
you are the smee of the organization you

352
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,560
know why does this matter to cargill

353
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,399
sometimes we even come right out and say

354
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
why does this matter to cargill so that

355
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,360
we are showing our stakeholders that yes

356
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
we are intelligence professionals who

357
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
happen to be smes in the cyber

358
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,079
environment but we're also sneezed to

359
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,160
our organization as our subject matter

360
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,880
expert we are you know bringing together

361
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
these two different

362
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
things that we are subject matter

363
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
experts in and that is why our analysis

364
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,240
and context is the best for our

365
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,680
organization because we know it best

366
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,839
next sharing is caring you know

367
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,079
the best analysis and products are total

368
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
waste if we don't share them in a way

369
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
that's meaningful

370
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
adjustable or educational for our

371
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
customers

372
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
and then finally learning um

373
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
you know we we really need to be

374
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
self-aware you know improve and with

375
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,680
self-awareness comes being open to

376
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
feedback and criticism

377
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
so example of this previously on our

378
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,639
team uh years ago we used to spend a lot

379
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,040
of time writing really formal products

380
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
um they'd footnotes like pretty headers

381
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,519
they were they were really nice

382
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,279
stakeholder feedback

383
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,279
they wanted analysis that was much

384
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
faster that didn't take as long to

385
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
format and put in the really pretty pdf

386
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,079
they wanted it in an email body

387
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,480
gut feel you know

388
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
what do you think and why and then they

389
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,839
wanted to be able to forward that email

390
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,360
throughout the organization or up

391
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,600
through the the hierarchical chain

392
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,720
we pivoted now our process is

393
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
much faster we actually end up engaging

394
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
with a larger more meaningful audience

395
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,040
we are now reaching stakeholders much

396
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
farther up in our organization and then

397
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
you know because it's in an email chain

398
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
and yes you know there's good and bad

399
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,000
with that um it's auditable and we can

400
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
contin we can contribute within that

401
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
email body as people ask questions and

402
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,519
you know we can kind of maintain um

403
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,519
a little bit more control over you know

404
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,199
who's in that chain to see what we're

405
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,440
saying uh we already talked about it you

406
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,320
know but for m a due diligence we worked

407
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,079
a similar change with our stakeholder so

408
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,079
that the information we're reporting was

409
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,440
presented in a more meaningful way

410
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
all right so this is now where we come

411
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,440
back to that adapt or die or be

412
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,959
outsourced uh

413
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,000
truth

414
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
as an industry we need to change how we

415
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,639
think about intelligence and i get that

416
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,760
saying we need to move beyond iocs

417
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,519
this might be kind of a significant

418
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,600
emotional event for some people but we

419
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
need to be really honest and clear we

420
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
need to move beyond iocs

421
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
all right so intelligence is a concept

422
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
right you know what is a function grows

423
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,160
in value when we mature and as we mature

424
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,800
we inherently become more strategic and

425
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,040
predictive uh back to the business and

426
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,959
to our security stakeholders

427
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,399
within this we have to speak the

428
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
language of the business we have to be

429
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
able to relate our expertise and our

430
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
findings in a way to you know i

431
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
that context what matters to the

432
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,079
business

433
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,279
we have to be able to integrate

434
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
ourselves to the business you know build

435
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
those relationships and trust

436
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,800
a couple weeks ago there was a tech

437
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
crunch article and the title was the

438
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,360
coming reckoning showing roi from thread

439
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
intel

440
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
you know it talked about how we need to

441
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
grow our skills beyond just supplying

442
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
the stock with data we have to move up

443
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,360
the pyramid of pain

444
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,680
we have to automate iocs you know again

445
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,440
if we can't show our value beyond iocs

446
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
we risk losing the business community

447
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
they may lose faith in what intelligence

448
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
can offer them

449
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,880
and again the risk finding yourself

450
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,160
outsourced

451
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,320
you know investing in our people you

452
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,480
know people are our greatest asset

453
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,399
we don't need to waste human capital on

454
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,560
iocs and data that we can automate

455
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
you know focus our people assets on

456
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,959
using them to grow strategically you

457
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
know even the best data

458
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
um

459
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,759
needs a human story it needs narration

460
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,839
it needs someone to tie it together that

461
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
context being the smee for the business

462
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,079
that's where people are most important

463
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,600
um you know lillian mentioned the

464
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,279
tyranny of day-to-day fires and the

465
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,160
burnout yes we need to stop the tyranny

466
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,759
you know of living under this putting

467
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
out fires day to day and focus on

468
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,759
planning and structure and not just

469
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,360
reaction to stimulus

470
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,440
you know so when we broaden our focus on

471
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
the long-term impact to the business you

472
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,839
know that helps us be predictable and

473
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
relatable to the business

474
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,040
all right so pulling this all together

475
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
now and focusing back on uh the m a due

476
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,199
diligence process

477
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,680
so first let's talk about scope passive

478
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,759
collection only we only do passive

479
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,880
collection

480
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,600
you know um obvious reasons this avoids

481
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
tipping off the target

482
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,560
sometimes target organizations uh beyond

483
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,920
just their leadership and board they may

484
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,839
not know they're for sale right so you

485
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
don't want to tip off their own security

486
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
teams um you know potentially let them

487
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,759
know that there's a sale pending

488
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,599
underway that could cause an you know

489
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,240
inadvertent insider threat issue

490
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,400
um you know there's some pretty obvious

491
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
legal implications for doing active

492
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,799
collection on another company right

493
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
don't go there

494
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
um you know also you don't want to break

495
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,039
someone's hardware by scanning in

496
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,160
something

497
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
um you know overall we do nothing

498
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
invasive illegal or unethical

499
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
all right so now looking at the m a

500
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
process there are two main phases here

501
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
pre-deal and post deal so in pre-deal

502
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
when we look at

503
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,400
the process of what we're going to do we

504
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
want to identify things that might

505
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
influence either negotiations or the

506
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
deal itself you know as anything adverse

507
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,919
happened that the target either knows of

508
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
or sometimes they don't know they've

509
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
been the victim of something

510
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,120
what's their current cybersecurity

511
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,160
posture

512
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
uh are there unique reputational risks

513
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
that can be discovered using um oh

514
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
center other advanced tools

515
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
and then finally we also look at it

516
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
from the perception of post deal what

517
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
happens after this goes through what

518
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
does our organization need to know you

519
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
know we need to

520
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,559
help the integration team uh figure out

521
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,360
you know

522
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,200
how are they going to bring this this

523
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,600
company into our network or not you know

524
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
can we provide them with some enumerated

525
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,559
infrastructure um help them shape their

526
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,559
integration phases you know this

527
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
information is really important because

528
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,240
then they can identify obstacles you

529
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,919
know like do we have to patch the entire

530
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,360
organization

531
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,160
for you know log4j um are they using

532
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
microsoft exchange whatever what will

533
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
cause disruptions or delays to that

534
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
integration process

535
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
all right and now i'm going to get ready

536
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,559
to hand this over to aurelia

537
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,160
thanks

538
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
so as one of the newest members on the

539
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
team i had the opportunity to help

540
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
refine our process with a fresh

541
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,880
perspective so like bethany said what

542
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,960
information can we find during the

543
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,039
pre-deal phase that may put our

544
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,440
organization in an advantageous position

545
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
during negotiations so

546
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,200
like she said all our research is going

547
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,679
to be done on an anonymized browser

548
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,200
and the tools that we're leveraging are

549
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,520
only going to do passive collection

550
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
so that's one thing that's really great

551
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,919
about osint open source intelligence is

552
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,000
there's really no single way to do it

553
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
there's several approaches that an

554
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
analyst could take to to achieve the end

555
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
state so what we did here is very simply

556
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
just came up with a generic taxonomy

557
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
that can essentially capture all of our

558
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
findings all the data that we're pulling

559
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
from all our tools and put it in a

560
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
format that's going to be easily

561
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
readable for for our consumer

562
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
and then of course depending on your

563
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,799
industry and the time constraints and

564
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,919
how much time you're given and the

565
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,039
budget um you know our our

566
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,280
template may not just like work for you

567
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,679
but it's something that can be simply

568
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,000
modified to to fit your needs so for

569
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
brand reputation obviously we want to

570
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,679
know if the company's been in the news

571
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,000
recently if it has you know what is the

572
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
nature of the articles that are being

573
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,679
tossed around on the internet

574
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,000
are they involved in any lawsuits what's

575
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,679
the nature of those

576
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
social media is actually you know pretty

577
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,200
helpful and useful when you want to

578
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
learn about consumer sentiment towards

579
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,559
the company

580
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,320
what sort of job openings does the

581
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,360
company have listed so you know after a

582
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
pretty significant incident this last

583
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
summer one of the things that we

584
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,120
observed was that almost immediately

585
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
after the the ransomware attack was made

586
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,159
public the company was posting um you

587
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,320
know ciso and cyber security positions

588
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
online and it highlighted a very obvious

589
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
gap in their security procedures that

590
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,799
they obviously didn't have and you know

591
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
eventually caused the the ransomware

592
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,799
attack that happened so

593
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,720
for digital infrastructure

594
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,600
um

595
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,960
you know we're after we have all our

596
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
tools set up and everything's refined um

597
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
what can we learn about the company's

598
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
digital infrastructure uh how diverse is

599
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,600
their environment you know do they have

600
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,919
mobile devices iot

601
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,320
operational technology you know and if

602
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,360
they do

603
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,840
can we determine using our tools if

604
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,600
their security measures are adequate for

605
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
those for those devices

606
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,039
we can find out what email services

607
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,960
they're using things like that

608
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
for digital hygiene we we like to call

609
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,200
upon our vulnerability management team

610
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,960
and our purple teams to collaborate with

611
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,799
us um because they do have

612
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,559
some more sophisticated tools that might

613
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,760
be able to illuminate additional

614
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,280
information for us

615
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,039
and so you know

616
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,960
in that take like can we find some

617
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
lessons learned or ar reports for the

618
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
for the target organization that might

619
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,039
uh describe some cyber events in the

620
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,919
past

621
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,679
um can we determine if they're patching

622
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,679
appropriately all those things come into

623
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,159
play towards the end and that will help

624
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,320
our due diligence team in the end come

625
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
to the table with some more additional

626
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,520
questions and follow-ups for during the

627
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
deal

628
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
and then finally for our results and

629
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
findings you know we're going to take

630
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,039
all this information all this data and

631
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,559
put it in a way that the due diligence

632
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,159
team is going to consume it it's going

633
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,480
to be helpful for them

634
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,039
slide please

635
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
so

636
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
i don't know about you but and as soon

637
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
as i start pulling data and i start

638
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
getting pretty inundated really quickly

639
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,039
and it could be pretty over overwhelming

640
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
really quickly so

641
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
on the left you'll see a very simple

642
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,799
workflow that we came up with

643
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,400
there's really nothing fancy about it

644
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,640
it's just a word document with a table

645
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,520
in it

646
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,280
but the point is here that it's

647
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,360
something that you can easily

648
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,120
use for your own organization or a

649
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,799
start-off point to create your own

650
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,720
program at your organization and it's

651
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
going to help you capture all these

652
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,720
disparate data that were that we're

653
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,799
pulling in from our tools and then

654
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,480
second on the right if you've ever taken

655
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,440
the sans osec class it's called sec 487

656
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,840
you might recognize this mind mup um and

657
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
it's super helpful because it helps us

658
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
break out our collection strategy in a

659
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,159
way that's easily easy easily to

660
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,440
visualize

661
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,559
as we head down our research project

662
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,320
main point here is you want to take all

663
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
that data and you want the data to drive

664
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
your research you don't want to get

665
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,400
inundated too quickly and just

666
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
come to a conclusion that there's

667
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,520
nothing happening but you do want to

668
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
find some pivot points to to which to

669
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,400
continue your research from

670
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,039
slide please

671
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,400
so here is our obligatory graph slide as

672
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,360
with any

673
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
analysis

674
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,360
presentation so we use malpigo for the

675
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,480
bulk of our m a research um and i'm i've

676
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,240
seen multiple graphs

677
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,159
yesterday and today so uh if you've

678
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,320
never heard of maltigo it's just a very

679
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,919
powerful intelligent forensic

680
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,200
application that

681
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
essentially lets us run searches from

682
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,799
disparate data sets

683
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,799
that are available in open source so

684
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,480
this is a quick footprint of the

685
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
sams.org domain

686
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,760
we've actually cleaned this up pretty

687
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
significantly as you can guess the

688
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
sans.org

689
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
domain is pretty complex but just to to

690
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
make the image a little easier to digest

691
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,880
here on the slide we're showing that

692
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,039
maltigo was able to enumerate several

693
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,120
portions of the infrastructure including

694
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,440
their servers and mail exchange services

695
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,919
so here we can identify ip ranges um and

696
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,840
and things like that that will help that

697
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,000
will serve as pivot points for when we

698
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,919
collaborate with our wall team or our

699
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,919
purple team as well

700
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
and you can even break these out even

701
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,159
further and find things like net blocks

702
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,520
isps

703
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,960
locations

704
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
you can even find certificates to see if

705
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,880
they're valid and up to date

706
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,159
the main point we're trying to highlight

707
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,320
here is that we're finding additional

708
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
points to pivot from so that we can

709
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,559
continue our research and then for

710
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,840
example we can take some of these ip

711
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
addresses or subdomains and just run

712
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,279
them through showdown

713
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,799
or run them through domain tools or

714
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,960
something like that

715
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,600
slide please

716
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
so here is a list of some more tools

717
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,480
that we like to use uh some of these

718
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,400
vendors offer free or affordable

719
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,240
versions as well as enterprise versions

720
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,919
of their tools

721
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,919
the key takeaway here is that most of

722
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,799
these can be used today regardless of

723
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,480
your of your budget and your time

724
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,400
constraints it's just a matter of simple

725
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
installation and you know running on

726
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,159
your machine right now um you'll have

727
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
the freedom to scale the use of the

728
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,840
tools to fit your needs and the free

729
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,600
versions are still really great really

730
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
powerful but the main difference will be

731
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
you might need some additional time to

732
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,880
conduct your research or you might need

733
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
some additional tools to complement the

734
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,320
findings that you have for the free

735
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,600
versions uh recon ng and spyderfoot both

736
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,679
offer community versions and the polls

737
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,200
may be a little bit difficult and time

738
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
consuming to parse through but still

739
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,799
really great if you're limited on budget

740
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,760
shodan love it or hate it it provides

741
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
really good information and it helps

742
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,919
determine digital hygiene which is

743
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,120
something that's very important when

744
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,799
you're considering integrating with

745
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,400
another network

746
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
for intelligence platforms i know we we

747
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
have several to choose from and i'm sure

748
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
many of them are here today

749
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,200
representing their organization so we

750
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
we we'd like to use them to create

751
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
keyword alerts for the target

752
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,080
organization and that helps us see um

753
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
mentions of the of the company either in

754
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,400
the deep and the dark web um or or on

755
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
twitter or social media and things like

756
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,159
that that'll help us again determine the

757
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
consumer sentiment towards this company

758
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,440
and then one of my favorites is the

759
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
authenticate silo browser it essentially

760
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,039
just provides misattribution while

761
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,760
you're surfing the net

762
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,400
slide please

763
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,640
so we've mentioned before um we like to

764
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,159
include our vulnerability management

765
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,919
team and our threat hunt and purple

766
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,200
teams as well

767
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
um because they have you know they have

768
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
a

769
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,039
different perspective and a different

770
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,600
separate insight that that might help um

771
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,480
bring the whole picture together

772
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,159
our pen test teams can use some of their

773
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
tools that are more sophisticated and

774
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,679
can help us come to some more

775
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
conclusions but again i'll foot stomp

776
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
that we are not doing anything intrusive

777
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,279
everything that we're doing is

778
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,799
collective is passive collection sorry

779
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,320
sorry

780
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,679
and it also goes for the pen testers and

781
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,200
the purple teams whenever we call upon

782
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,760
them to assist on our research

783
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,480
slide please

784
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,400
alright so we're done with all our

785
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
research we've got our purple team and

786
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,039
threat hunt and everyone else's

787
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,360
input for the for the product

788
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,799
and we're ready to type up the final

789
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,039
product um again to go back to what

790
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,480
bethany was mentioning you know we had

791
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
in the past we'd had these really long

792
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
academic papers that the due diligence

793
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
team really couldn't get a lot of use of

794
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,120
unless they actually spent a long time

795
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
reading and going through everything

796
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,880
so for our team we've we've noticed that

797
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
really quick a bluff an exact sum right

798
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,279
up front with the findings that are

799
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,760
important and and their recommendations

800
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,960
and the follow-up questions that we need

801
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,399
to provide right up front for them um

802
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,320
and then right right after that we like

803
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,919
to include our table with the very

804
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,600
granular details of all the things that

805
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,960
we found

806
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
and then as also i've also found it's

807
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
very helpful to find or to provide

808
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
screenshots of some of the some of the

809
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
pieces of information you might have

810
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,799
found that you know with a written

811
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,919
description really won't meet uh the

812
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,120
won't be enough for for the due

813
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,600
diligence team to answer questions so

814
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,679
and then in contrast for the post deal

815
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,039
you know for the integration team

816
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,720
they're going to want all the nitty

817
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,279
gritty details right up front um they're

818
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,399
going to need they're going to use those

819
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,520
technical

820
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
technical details to come up with their

821
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,440
their course of action for the

822
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,039
integration plan

823
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,640
um and then lastly it's a good idea to

824
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,159
continue to monitor the keyword alerts

825
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,520
that we created in our intelligence

826
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,640
platforms uh naturally after the

827
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,480
the transaction happens and the

828
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,399
announcement is made public there's

829
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,919
going to be an uptick in mentions of the

830
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,120
companies that are involved in the

831
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,200
transaction so we like to monitor that

832
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,880
to see what

833
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,799
what the internet is saying about about

834
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,399
the acquisition or the merger um

835
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,520
this is also helpful as we saw a little

836
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,440
bit late late during last year the year

837
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,559
of ransomware where threat actors were

838
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,880
going after the acquisitions and mergers

839
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
that were being publicly made to target

840
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,720
for their next victim so

841
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,600
um

842
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,760
super helpful and that's pretty much my

843
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,799
end then with that i'm going to turn it

844
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,440
over to bethany

845
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,320
thanks for elia okay so um aurelia

846
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
already kind of mentioned some of this

847
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
but the intel cycle doesn't end after

848
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,159
the deal goes through you know we need

849
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,880
to bring things full circle so um she

850
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
just talked about how we enter the

851
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,279
acquisition organization into our intel

852
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,520
platforms for keyword alerting

853
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
and this lets us know about those dark

854
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,279
web mentions you know especially you

855
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,120
know small indicators like credentials

856
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,159
for sale access for sale or um you know

857
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,640
vulnerability vulnerabilities affecting

858
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,640
known tools or softwares that they use

859
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,799
but most importantly you have to do this

860
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,720
in alignment with your stakeholders keep

861
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,360
them in the loop so for us on our team

862
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,799
in our security

863
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,640
organization it's the business

864
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,360
information security officers so these

865
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,279
are the people who interface directly

866
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,520
from the security organization to the

867
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,039
business leadership

868
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,080
um

869
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,559
so you know often we'll work with them

870
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,039
and if there are too many

871
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,840
you know uh targets or keywords for us

872
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
to put into our platform in a way that's

873
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
manageable we'll work with them to

874
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,240
identify say like tears or you know if

875
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,159
you could pick your top 20 which ones

876
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,840
would they be that you're most concerned

877
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,799
about

878
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,760
so then they have a little bit um

879
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,679
you know they have some stake in this

880
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,000
too right because they've helped us you

881
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
know identify what might have higher

882
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,520
risk or not

883
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
um you know

884
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,760
so

885
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,039
this information you know it's

886
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,520
bi-directional we inform

887
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,360
the besos the business information

888
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,960
security officers

889
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,399
you know this helps them inform the

890
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,320
business so the business can continue to

891
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,799
make informed decisions and then also we

892
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,399
share this with the rest of the security

893
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,880
organization um so that you know they

894
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,840
can have their own informed security

895
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
decisions bringing things full circle

896
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,960
all right

897
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
so we've talked a little bit about our

898
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,799
journey and in our current you know

899
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,880
state where we are in our own evolution

900
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
with this we've talked about some of our

901
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,559
lessons learned and how we got here

902
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,559
we've talked about how to scale

903
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,919
things for your own budget and

904
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,679
organizational needs but how do you

905
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,840
start an m a due diligence program with

906
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,399
your cyber intel team

907
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,519
number one build buy-in gain trust you

908
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,240
know

909
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,080
we also need to emphasize that just

910
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,679
because this is what our journey looked

911
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,840
like and this is what process and

912
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,320
methodology works for us this will look

913
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
different for every organization so you

914
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,640
know identify what you can affect and

915
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
start with that

916
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,279
using those open source case studies to

917
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,120
illustrate risk and opportunity that

918
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
large hospitality

919
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
chain data breach that one that one

920
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
really wakes people up um and it's it's

921
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,919
well known enough and is covered by

922
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,279
enough uh

923
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,080
you know well-known media that

924
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,840
people pay attention to it and chances

925
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
are they've also already heard of it

926
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
you know ocean research this can have

927
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,159
tremendous value if done well and done

928
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,600
correctly you know but ocean is

929
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,080
constantly changing so it also is a good

930
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,399
exercise that you um can consistently

931
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,000
practice

932
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,840
you know building that list of resources

933
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,120
and tools

934
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,600
you know first i would say identify what

935
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
you need to know and what you need to

936
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
collect and then find your tool i think

937
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,600
a mistake a lot of teams and people make

938
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
is they say well i want this tool or i

939
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,039
have this tool and i'm going to build

940
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,720
out everything based on what that tool

941
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,440
can do that's backwards you know first

942
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,600
identify your priorities

943
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,840
what do you need to know and then start

944
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,440
to look for what can help fill those

945
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,640
gaps for you

946
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,519
you know those free affordable ones

947
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,880
use them

948
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,039
you know get your leadership buy-in

949
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,360
contact your company's m a section maybe

950
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,960
they're in business development or you

951
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,399
know business strategy corporate

952
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,679
strategy

953
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,519
and then also you know you can use your

954
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,960
company's own

955
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,880
you know after they

956
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
have done a merger and acquisition even

957
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,799
if it's years ago and it is publicly

958
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,559
known and that there was you know your

959
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,320
company's pr department issued a

960
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,640
statement on it and was you know

961
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,159
elsewhere

962
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,320
go back do that legacy merger and

963
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,519
acquisition

964
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,760
um it's often good practice for your own

965
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,279
methodology and you can always bring

966
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,279
your findings to your section

967
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,039
and then finally partner with other

968
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,880
teams even external to your security

969
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
organization so for us that was the

970
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,960
communications team we realized that we

971
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,760
were identifying brand reputation issues

972
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,519
i don't really want to cover brand

973
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,039
reputation because that seems like a

974
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,399
communications thing

975
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,240
but we realized that our tools were

976
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,159
pulling in different information from

977
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,480
different external sources than theirs

978
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,000
were so

979
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
we just got together and said we want to

980
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,519
help you and help each other

981
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,440
you know make it make it a mutual thing

982
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,039
you're both on the same

983
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,919
strategic journey together

984
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,799
all right

985
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,679
build it out additional use cases um

986
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
this methodology and these tools frankly

987
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,279
complement a lot of other teams

988
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
strategies it's really specific within

989
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,039
the security organization

990
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,519
supply chain security oh my gosh hugely

991
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,640
visible risk you know people still like

992
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,080
start shaking when you talk about

993
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,320
solarwinds and cassaya

994
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,799
ocean methodologies use them these can

995
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,880
identify those potential risks that you

996
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,719
have with you know application

997
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,520
onboarding third-party risk management

998
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,599
digging into supply chain security you

999
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,440
know looking at what are you actually

1000
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,159
bringing into your organization

1001
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,320
it also identifies natural touch points

1002
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
with other teams we've already talked

1003
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,359
about like purple team

1004
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,440
pen test application security

1005
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,520
infrastructure you know cyber intel is

1006
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,199
integral to everything intel drives

1007
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,199
everything across your organization or

1008
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,800
it can if you identify those

1009
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,520
opportunities
