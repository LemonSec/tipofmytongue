1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,600
and we've got one more talk to keep it

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
up today um closing out our presenters

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
um is grace chi

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,519
uh who is going to be taking us home

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,440
with a talk that i have been looking

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
forward to i think since we got the

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
proposal um it's answering an age-old

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,640
question that i think we love to debate

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,519
about

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,160
uh in cti which is about sharing i've

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,920
worked at places where

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
share recklessly share everything share

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,519
with anyone

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
and i've worked at companies where like

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,880
if you think about work when you leave

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,960
the building you will get fired and i

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
think a lot of those are just based off

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,920
of

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
instinct and what people have done and i

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,640
love that we're gonna have grace come

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
and bring us some actual data and

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,079
insights

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,800
about these human aspects of cti so

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
grace let me know when you are up and

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,559
running we will get uh controls over to

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,600
you

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,239
i'm good to go

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,520
there you go all right we're good

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
um hi everyone thanks for joining my

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
talk is sharing caring a deeply human

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,119
study on cti networking we're almost at

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
the end so thanks for staying on i'm so

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
excited to unveil my findings for the

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
very first time today it was just

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,320
released publicly a link to the full

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
report is available in my slack hallway

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,159
if you're in there and i'll share the

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
url to the report on slide at the end as

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,880
well so don't worry about missing any

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
visuals get a drink of water stretch

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,479
your legs i'm standing myself and we're

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
gonna have a fun time

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,119
before we dive right in let's talk about

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,920
how i got here my name is grace chi i'm

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,479
co-founder and ceo of pulsedive which is

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
a threat intel data and platform startup

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,439
i'm also a huge fan of overly stressful

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,079
board games and an artist on the side so

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,399
a big shout out to ashton everyone jump

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
over into that i think number nine

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,119
channel and just drop her some love for

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
all the notes that she's taken so far

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,799
i've always had an interest observing

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
the people the process the technology

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
dynamic and the human component even

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,758
more so in cyber security

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,280
being a pulse dive it means that i have

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
the privilege of working with teams and

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,840
individuals all over the world at all

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,160
levels of program maturity

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,520
and from there you really get to observe

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
traits for success both in the short and

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,599
the long term

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
the first real spark though for this

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
topic began about 12 months ago at last

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,040
year's cti summit

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
i had started embedding myself more

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,959
deeply in the community i got invited to

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,560
a few trust groups that i didn't even

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
know existed and i was starting to grow

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
this awareness of how different players

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,640
were already interacting in this

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,319
essential way but that was really

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
obscure that i didn't know about

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
and that tipping point to really get

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
started like doing this through you know

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,879
putting pen to paper was when a specific

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
bob ross and weatherman impersonator

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,120
compelled me to put myself out there

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,959
with content that i cared about that

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,720
others would benefit from i when i

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,159
watched cti summit i was like yeah i'll

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,760
present in like 10 years when i'm ready

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
and so that's why i'm here today

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,599
so that's the crux of this today's topic

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
having a conversation with all of you

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,319
asking hey what's so important about

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,640
networking and cti to do your job

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
and what can we do to improve it

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,319
cyber threat intelligence is a growing

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,360
space

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
there's an industry-wide consensus that

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,000
teams cannot effectively operate in an

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
intelligent silo you hear this like a

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,080
lot phrased in a lot of different ways

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,200
you've probably heard it a bunch of

97
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
times in the last two days as well

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
and in support of improved cti sharing

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
stakeholders have invested research and

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
development around areas like

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
cross-boundary collaboration not just

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,519
from the government but industry

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,000
partnerships legal initiatives

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
standardization that's making sure

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
you're speaking the same language within

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,760
and across things like mitre attack

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,959
framework

108
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,640
and the sticks and tax uh sticks and

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
taxi technical standards come into play

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
here

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
measuring trust is another one there's

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
some really interesting academic work

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
about how you can manage and measure

114
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
trust between peers and also reporting

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
best practices

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
these are all important

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,238
yet there's a lack of clarity around how

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,639
professionals can most effectively

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,918
network today

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,400
the conventional wisdom to date is that

121
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
like cti networking is achieved through

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
trial and error and then on an

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,800
individual basis

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,840
so

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
i set out what the objective of

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,759
benchmarking how different methods stack

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,720
up

128
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
how and why individuals participate at

129
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,520
all

130
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,680
and then the role that organizations

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
play

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,880
uh one thing to note here is outside of

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
scope were things that were not directly

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
related to cti work

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
so it's great if you're networking but

136
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,040
it didn't matter if it was for a new job

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,000
getting a promotion or closing a sale

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
and i also didn't want to get into the

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,440
waters of specific tools and

140
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
technologies because i wanted everyone

141
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
to be able to chime in no vendor

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
conflicts and you know leave a different

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
space for that discussion

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
this research is intended as a starting

145
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
point the goal in sharing this knowledge

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
is to encourage intentional inclusive

147
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
and strategic approaches around cti

148
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
networking as an asset and not as an

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,759
afterthought

150
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,840
and the key insights today has a little

151
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
something for everyone it's kind of wide

152
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,479
range from management trying to help

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,919
understand what the barriers are and the

154
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,759
best practices how they can become

155
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
influencers and connect this to their

156
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,880
program

157
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,919
to new entrants looking to demystify

158
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
what colleagues are doing and like how

159
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
to even get started what it looks like

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,160
and to do this we reached out directly

161
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
to cti professionals a bunch of you in

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
the slack channel probably submitted a

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
response

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
quantitative data was collected through

165
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
a google form survey in november of

166
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
december of last year

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
no personal information was a collect

168
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
required to submit and no compensation

169
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,840
was offered

170
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
and i know that the survey link was

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
distributed through things like social

172
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
media posts direct messages some trust

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
groups some isacs newsletters and some

174
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,000
others that i'm not aware of

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
qualitative data on the other hand was

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,639
gathered in open-ended survey questions

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
as well as however i could reach you so

178
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
one-on-one with yours truly emails

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,479
messages phone phone calls video chat

180
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
and i wanted to just stop here and say a

181
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,919
big thank you to everyone who put in

182
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
that time and sent in response and not

183
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
only sent into response but put in

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,520
really thoughtful answers even the

185
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
optional questions

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
and while by no means is this

187
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
comprehensive together we've already

188
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,800
established a foundation that we can now

189
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
build off of

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,759
so we can ease in first by taking a

191
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,240
quick look very quick into who responded

192
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
to the survey

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
we had a good spread of job functions

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,599
and overall experience

195
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,319
cti was the primary job function for

196
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,880
over half of the respondent and an

197
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,039
assortment of other related roles making

198
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,840
up the other half security ops incident

199
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,240
response executive leadership um these

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
are pretty expected proportions and even

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,639
the same order that samara had listed as

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,479
her intel partners in a previous talk so

203
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,919
validated

204
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,880
uh while the years of total experience

205
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,560
were evenly represented um over half of

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
respondents reported less than five

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,520
years of cti direct experience and this

208
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
is consistent with the relative recency

209
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,280
and the growth of the field drawing in

210
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,919
experienced talent from career pivots as

211
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
well as specializations within the field

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,560
of security overall

213
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
most respondents were overwhelmingly

214
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
from for-profit organizations and

215
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
there's kind of two branches here the

216
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
first branch is in-house cyber security

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
team so think enterprises banks

218
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
institutions

219
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,280
and the other half was by cyber security

220
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,000
providers of any sort so that includes

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
vendors professional services and

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
consulting

223
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,199
i did hope to get a larger government

224
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,360
response but during the survey itself

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
like i came across some resistance and

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
also even though it's an anonymous

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
survey some rejections from the ability

228
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
to participate when they ask within

229
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,639
their team

230
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,960
but on the for-profit side

231
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,960
employers of all sizes are represented

232
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,720
geographically respondents were heavily

233
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,039
skewed towards north america making up

234
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
over two-thirds of all respondents it

235
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,719
was a survey in english we did some

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,159
international outreach but you know

237
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,399
north america dominated

238
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,440
however the respondents uh did operate

239
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
in multiple regions

240
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,440
half reported working in at least three

241
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,080
regions and a quarter reported being

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
very global working in all seven regions

243
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
listed here

244
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,200
uh a small digression i had to put this

245
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
in

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
i asked a question about job

247
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
satisfaction

248
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
wondering if there might be some

249
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
correlation between some survey question

250
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
and satisfaction rating and i really had

251
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,320
no idea what i would find

252
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,360
but so many of you are so gosh darn

253
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,519
happy that i couldn't make a segment out

254
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,399
of it

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,399
satisfaction was high across all

256
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,760
segments and sub segments and in that 71

257
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
you see that satisfied and highly

258
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
satisfied about half were highly

259
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,519
satisfied

260
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,600
and so i didn't have enough people that

261
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
responded who were unhappy peers and

262
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
that made me happy i hope that makes you

263
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,760
happy

264
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,519
it was interesting though to see that

265
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,600
there was a small dip in satisfaction

266
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
ratings for those working at ten to a

267
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
hundred thousand employees it's still

268
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,399
pretty high but if that rings true to

269
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,920
you if you have research you know that

270
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
you can fight can you share it with

271
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
black because i

272
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
personal curiosity

273
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
all right let's jump into our findings

274
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,720
you have the campers

275
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
so the first

276
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,279
research angle dove into how different

277
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,200
cti networking methods stacked up

278
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
and don't worry about reading like the

279
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
details on the slide these are just

280
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,120
graphics that i pulled from my report

281
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
in this section

282
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
i sought to define

283
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,040
the level of participation across seven

284
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
channels

285
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,480
like private invite-only peer-to-peer

286
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
trust groups social media and public

287
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,440
forums one-to-one direct messages

288
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
industry events volunteer groups paid

289
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
membership groups like i sacks and dark

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,560
web

291
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
then i asked about perceived quality

292
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,000
was this method valuable high confidence

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
unique timely

294
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
and finally i looked at the results not

295
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
all of them are shown here but i asked

296
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
things like did this method help detect

297
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,279
an attack did it provide value during an

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,640
attack

299
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
did it contribute to remediation did it

300
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
help you share resources to work on

301
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
something you couldn't do alone

302
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,760
and what we found out came on top

303
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,920
is that there are no shortcuts to the

304
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
strongest network

305
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
this is not something that happens

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
overnight and this is not something that

307
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
is ever completed

308
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
the level of participation the

309
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,360
perception of quality and results they

310
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,680
were all consistently leading for the

311
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
kind of traditional one-to-one direct

312
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
messages

313
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
and to trust groups and this dominance

314
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
was observed across all sub-segments too

315
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
as private channels this highlights that

316
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,160
difficulty in scaling trust

317
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,040
both are heavily ad hoc they're based on

318
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
your personal reputation and all about

319
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
reciprocated contributions

320
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,279
and some other tidbits here that might

321
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,959
be interesting to the folks in you know

322
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,079
watching

323
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,920
100 of respondents working in the

324
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,320
largest employee orgs reported regularly

325
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
using one-to-one dm

326
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
and professionals with 10-plus years of

327
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,839
total experience

328
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,079
rated one-to-one higher on all fronts

329
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,519
compared to those with less than 10

330
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,839
years which totaled up it was a 46

331
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,519
difference for trust groups they run

332
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
high across all quality metrics except

333
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
uniqueness so you'll see when there's

334
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
the news of the day there's some echo

335
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,399
chambering some a lot of like repeated

336
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,320
conversations

337
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,399
and most trust groups are hidden and

338
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,160
they kind of have obscure vetting

339
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,399
systems until you're already in on the

340
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,399
other side

341
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
a rare few like curated intelligence who

342
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,399
i talk to they maintain a public

343
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,600
presence to share useful tlp white intel

344
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
to benefit the global community but

345
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
either way most are started in a pretty

346
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
grassroots manner with peers who know

347
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
each other a spin-off from another group

348
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
where they work together

349
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,680
and then they grow around a niche

350
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,399
focused area for collaboration

351
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,639
ultimately though you have to know a few

352
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,760
someone

353
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
not just someone who will want to invite

354
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
you but then a couple other someone who

355
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
will vouch for you

356
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
in qualitative responses many

357
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
respondents noted a reliance on trust

358
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
groups in particular

359
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
an enthusiasm for establishing more

360
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
trust communities too even though time

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,560
is limited and you'll learn that that's

362
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
one of the biggest barriers

363
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,720
these groups do offer expert work and

364
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
commentary and can save a lot of effort

365
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,079
and help provide a lens onto everything

366
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,920
that's happening

367
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
and then small note uh those with 10

368
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,399
plus years of experience and those with

369
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,959
cti primary job functions

370
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,839
they rated trust groups more highly

371
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
and this brings to light how more senior

372
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
and more specialized practitioners have

373
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,440
both the access and the ability to

374
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,399
leverage this community

375
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,760
but

376
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,560
don't underestimate social media

377
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
is it noisy yes is it chaotic yes is it

378
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
frustrating i mean if you ask me i say

379
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
yes

380
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,160
but it remains popular for a reason

381
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,720
while social media and public forums

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,199
fall short across multiple dimensions of

383
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,760
quality it ultimately outperformed when

384
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
you were assessing impact

385
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
respondents they shared anecdotes about

386
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
the strengths of channels like twitter

387
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,079
like reddit like linkedin for discovery

388
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
not just including meeting strangers

389
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,240
around shared research topics but also

390
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
being contacted for their niche

391
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,839
expertise that they were broadcasting

392
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
out over time

393
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,920
and in addition to short-term projects

394
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,279
these connections

395
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
led to deeper relationships outside of

396
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,279
social right so like how do you get to

397
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
the dm how do you get to a trust group

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,959
you meet people social media is one of

399
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,959
those venues so is going to events so

400
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,279
it's volunteering

401
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,160
most users rated social media as highly

402
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,440
valuable and very timely while

403
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,120
simultaneously having very very low

404
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
scores of confidence

405
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
an interesting note here is that there

406
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,399
was a single open-ended answer that said

407
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,560
that the highest confident data comes

408
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
from following quality vendors and

409
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,800
researchers on social media there's one

410
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,240
person who said that

411
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,160
and i think the key advice that i was

412
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
gleaning from the data here was that you

413
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
need to have a system in place you need

414
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
to know how to tightly moderate and

415
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,959
curate your feeds know what you're

416
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,959
looking for because at best it's a

417
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
little distracting and it gets worse

418
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,839
from there

419
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
so to help everybody here

420
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
drop in your favorite quality intel

421
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
account from social or a list a group a

422
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,959
thread in the chat if you have it

423
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,920
and also if you want uh for social media

424
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,199
make some new connections if you're

425
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,440
comfortable by checking out the business

426
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
card swap channel in the summit all

427
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,560
those links i think are going away in a

428
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,920
couple hours so make sure you grab them

429
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,240
before they're gone

430
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,199
so these three channels came out on top

431
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,160
if you use one or two or all three of

432
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,639
these on a weekly basis i'd love to hear

433
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,480
drop in a note about what your secret

434
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,320
formula for success is

435
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,600
or what your frustrations are really

436
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
moving on to the second section was all

437
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,320
about how and why individuals network

438
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,399
here once again no need to read this i

439
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,040
sought to define the benefit

440
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,199
the activities they were engaged in and

441
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,079
the personal opinions and outlook

442
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,320
and what we found

443
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,399
is that cti networking

444
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,240
was viewed as an important source for

445
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
action and awareness respondents had

446
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,120
high levels of agreement in ingesting

447
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,279
and acting on various types of content

448
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,880
and that content might be about getting

449
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,120
valuable threat data staying aware of

450
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
what's happening strategically taking

451
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
proactive measures finding and vetting

452
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,079
in new sources and methods

453
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,079
and the success stories that were shared

454
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,160
in the open-ended section span from the

455
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,560
micro like a single detection something

456
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
that they escalated overnight that came

457
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,279
through a network

458
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
to campaign and incident level response

459
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,120
support

460
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,680
to at the macro level collaboratively

461
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,519
and continuously building a landscape

462
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
with multiple vantage points of their

463
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,240
peers together over time

464
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,079
i have some stories some quotes below

465
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,399
that illustrates this variation but you

466
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,839
know you'll you'll get the slides later

467
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,720
don't worry about reading it right now

468
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
the statements that i had regarding

469
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
working with others feeling less like a

470
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,920
silo they had more moderate levels of

471
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
agreement around 55

472
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,119
and that really demonstrates that value

473
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,400
placed on concrete actionable timely

474
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
networking with outcomes that you can do

475
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
something with and when you're

476
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,000
contributing and participating keep that

477
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,720
in mind too

478
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,359
this one all right this one was a really

479
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,400
fun one

480
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
i asked individuals to rank certain

481
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
items from what's provided the most to

482
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,039
least value and and no one argued but

483
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,079
feel free to have constructive

484
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,120
conversations about this um but all

485
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,360
levels of the often debated data info

486
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
intel spectrum they ended up on top

487
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
compared to things like support or

488
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,280
advice

489
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,600
emotionally technically

490
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,960
but which level depends on who you ask

491
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
the left showcases the ranking across

492
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
all respondents and respondents with

493
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
primary cti job function had the same

494
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
exact ranking so i didn't replicate that

495
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
here

496
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,440
a note is that as the years of direct

497
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,679
cti experience increase

498
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,760
the value of contextualized information

499
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,240
also correspondingly increases

500
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
but then when you break it out by

501
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
different functions

502
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,400
like raw data was particularly

503
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,480
controversial it's kind of middling

504
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
overall and then it jumps to first place

505
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,360
in incident response then to deadlocks

506
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,679
and security operations so we're hearing

507
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,520
some trauma from the stock up you know

508
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,240
like echoing in this presentation and

509
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,160
then it stays quite low for executive

510
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,919
leadership

511
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
contextualized information on the other

512
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
hand uh starts off right at the top like

513
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
we talked about then it drops to tied

514
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,520
for second last in incident response

515
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
back up to the top for security

516
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
operations and then dropping into second

517
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,600
place for executive leadership coming

518
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
second only to processed intel and i

519
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,440
think you know rick can probably confirm

520
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,799
here that we could have all bet money

521
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,240
that intel would have been number one

522
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
for leadership

523
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
those with the least

524
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
and the most years of experience valued

525
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
advice more highly

526
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
and so

527
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,880
you know this reflects a couple

528
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
different reasons for advice either

529
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,320
you're starting off you're learning the

530
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,799
roads you're settling in or you're doing

531
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,320
a lot of work and you're relying on your

532
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,559
trusted network to work on specific

533
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,880
challenges

534
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
small orgs place more value on raw data

535
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
large orgs place more value on the

536
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,919
advice and opinions of others which does

537
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,760
make sense because 100 of them are

538
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,919
regularly participating in one-on-one dm

539
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
and this

540
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
kind of feeds into something that i

541
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,039
didn't quite expect when i was going in

542
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,520
it was not part of my hypothesis but i

543
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
found the

544
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
survey's strongest consensus in the

545
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,559
statement cti networking is important

546
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,200
for team members of all levels

547
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
out of all the questions asked about

548
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,799
participation and opinions everything

549
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,600
like that this statement had the highest

550
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
level of agreement it was 91 overall and

551
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
the more senior segments went up to 93.

552
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
this tied to

553
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,919
an unexpected barrier

554
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,400
that i didn't even include in the survey

555
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,679
and a handful of qualitative respondents

556
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,000
noted that their biggest barrier

557
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
was related to personal fear

558
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,760
imposter syndrome feeling

559
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,520
unknowledgeable feeling too new not

560
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
being able to contribute more

561
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,919
but then on the flip side about half so

562
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
that's like 50 maybe even up to 80 80

563
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,360
people who offered advice addressed this

564
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,520
so we're going to take a little bit of a

565
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,000
data intermission and look at the advice

566
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
themes that i've pulled out

567
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,080
it's to participate it's to be

568
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,320
trustworthy it's to always be strategic

569
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
it is a lot of words this is actually

570
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,159
against my own best practice but while i

571
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,000
was working on this presentation i found

572
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,159
it so much more powerful to quote real

573
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,600
people and some of you might have

574
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
actually written this that's on the

575
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
slide now

576
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,840
so

577
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,600
quickly going over some of these to

578
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,880
participate

579
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,720
have both human and automated

580
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,280
interactions in mind start small share

581
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,039
what you can start with people you trust

582
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
find a good community of people you like

583
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
that respect you and then just share

584
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
what you can

585
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,919
and don't let imposter syndrome stop you

586
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,520
and then find and follow people on

587
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
social media or through any other method

588
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,679
that are already working and interested

589
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,960
in those target areas that you're

590
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,039
looking to get into and do more

591
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,440
and if you know feel yourself surround

592
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,360
yourself by these voices and if you see

593
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,039
something and they're doing a good job

594
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,600
also let them know

595
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
building trust

596
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
don't

597
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
burn trust ever it is

598
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,600
so hard to build it takes time and it's

599
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
so easy to destroy or at least erode

600
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,400
make sure you have good practices that

601
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
you are a high you know you have high

602
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
professional standards you're being a

603
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
good analyst you have good critical

604
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
thinking you have conclusions based on

605
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
sound principles

606
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,039
you're going to get into top circles

607
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,480
you're going to get attention by

608
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,559
contributing your own intelligence not

609
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,799
just regurgitating there's nothing wrong

610
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,080
with retweeting there's nothing wrong

611
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
with sharing stuff that's already out

612
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
there but that won't differentiate you

613
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,760
or add value to you build trust to you

614
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,880
as a person um as much as doing your own

615
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
work and sharing that out

616
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
and speaking to that

617
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,919
provide value with the niche you're

618
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,159
experienced in we all don't know how to

619
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,240
do a lot of stuff and that's okay

620
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,400
if you can translate across three

621
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
languages really quick if you can write

622
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
a script to save everyone a heck of a

623
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,159
lot of time

624
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,760
if you can communicate so well that you

625
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
get those end stakeholders to do the

626
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,039
thing that your team wanted them to do

627
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,600
these are all values and as you kind of

628
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
build those muscles up and as people

629
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
know they can come to you you in turn

630
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
can also go to them to get stuff to fill

631
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
in your gaps or things that you're

632
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
working on

633
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,080
finally

634
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,200
please be careful and strategic

635
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
understand what your organization needs

636
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,080
i don't need to beat the drum again

637
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,760
we've heard it a lot but if you're gonna

638
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,440
go out and you're gonna network know

639
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
what you're looking for know how you're

640
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
gonna collect it know once you collect

641
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,960
it what you're gonna do on it with it

642
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,039
because data on the floor

643
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
is useless it's a waste of time for

644
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
everyone

645
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
and trust but verify who you're talking

646
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,919
to whatever you're sharing understand

647
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,280
that that goes with the level of how

648
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,120
much you vetted them

649
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,360
and i really appreciated this one

650
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,720
be skeptical with data shared um but

651
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
please be generous to those who share it

652
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
as it can take a lot of courage it can

653
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,919
be something very novel um i think it's

654
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,360
like what garrett had said where you're

655
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,799
not going out there saying i hate your

656
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,880
face this was bad and you should feel

657
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,799
bad because that's a waste of both

658
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
people's times honestly

659
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,159
if you're going to provide constructive

660
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,080
criticism if it's worth your time to do

661
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
that

662
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
go in with the intent to improve and not

663
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,760
to demean and understand it can be kind

664
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
of terrifying

665
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
finally

666
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,039
select trust groups based on impact and

667
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,799
not just trust groups really anything

668
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,720
you're doing in terms of networking if

669
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,240
you're struggling to find value like

670
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
testing is out try things out but just

671
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,720
move on your time is limited don't over

672
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,080
stretch yourself with things that are

673
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
not paying off for you

674
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
and so

675
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,720
this is just a snippet of the

676
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,360
individualized advice by and for this

677
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,840
community

678
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,520
and then finally i explored how cti

679
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
networking fits within the job and the

680
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,679
organization

681
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,960
i ask questions about barriers processes

682
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,760
organizational culture

683
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
and news flash there's not enough time

684
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,840
in our day i don't think anyone's gonna

685
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
disagree with me here

686
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,159
most respondents reported dedicating

687
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
time each week to cti networking even

688
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,080
though they say that they don't have the

689
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,279
time

690
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,159
61 percent had at least some standards

691
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,080
in place or highly standardized

692
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,559
processes for what they collected

693
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,799
despite this only a quarter of

694
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,400
respondents measured or reported on the

695
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,240
effectiveness of their networking effort

696
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,000
two-thirds reported that their biggest

697
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,960
challenge

698
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
was having no time

699
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
and another top two of the issues

700
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,279
included policies around sharing and

701
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
legality these are external forces that

702
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,880
are preventing sharing

703
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,960
noisiness and the ability to bring in

704
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,279
useful actionable data is absolutely a

705
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,279
barrier i've included it here but the

706
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,960
conversation around that started to

707
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,559
deviate towards what we defined as out

708
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,159
of scope in terms of technologies and

709
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,679
standards

710
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,799
and these challenges to uh deviated from

711
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,799
general cti surveys looking at team

712
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,640
barriers which were most focused on

713
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,200
budget and lack of talent here it's

714
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,279
about pressures and things that people

715
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
were not able to do that they wanted to

716
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,960
do

717
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,480
and looking at another lens

718
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,880
what we found pretty unsurprisingly is

719
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,559
that the strong encouragement and

720
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,240
support that happens at that individual

721
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
level

722
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
is lacking at the organizational

723
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,760
we just talked about how enthusiastic

724
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,080
people were to get more participation to

725
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
have others participate and then when

726
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
you you know at the end of the day

727
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,279
though it's mostly on you and between

728
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,799
two people

729
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,679
cti networking directly supports items

730
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,400
like

731
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
information sharing and strategic

732
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
awareness that you find in cybersecurity

733
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
maturity assessment models

734
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,000
yet there's a significant contrast

735
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,240
between the highly positive individual

736
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,640
statements like i encourage those who

737
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
report to me to participate it's

738
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
important for my job it's a part of my

739
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,679
time

740
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,919
and neutral organizational sentiments in

741
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,080
the middle here with statements like i'm

742
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,640
rewarded for participating it's easy to

743
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
get new methods approved it's well

744
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
defined or it's structured in my area of

745
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,039
work

746
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,440
one note though is that while in-house

747
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
and security vendors the two large

748
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,760
for-profit sectors that or demographics

749
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
that responded they shared the same

750
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,520
level of individual sentiment

751
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,840
those working for security companies

752
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,640
revealed slightly more positive

753
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
sentiments on the organizational side

754
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,200
about 10 further over to the right

755
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,760
given the benefit to organization

756
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,480
resulting from individual participation

757
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,120
this is a key area for development

758
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,159
maturity strategic operational planning

759
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,240
they all benefit from

760
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
one acknowledging the role that cti

761
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,279
networking is already playing

762
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,360
and two incorporating those efforts

763
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,039
within the program

764
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,440
from there organizations can create

765
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,080
structures remove some barriers within

766
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,039
reason

767
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,399
and dually reward efforts

768
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,919
so let's summarize the top insights then

769
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,000
take a quick look ahead

770
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,360
i know we covered a ton of data here

771
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,240
the research serves as a starting peak

772
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,159
into the nebulous

773
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,200
jumbly even secretive world of cti

774
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,440
networking and its impact

775
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
when we looked at how different methods

776
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,760
stacked up the crowd favorites of one to

777
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,960
one dm

778
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,799
peer-to-peer trust groups went out like

779
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,440
by far as the most favored methods

780
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
across participation

781
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,080
perceived quality observe results

782
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480
and if you want to be a community player

783
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,919
in threat intel

784
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,520
build your network and pipeline with

785
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
these top methods in mind

786
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,000
social media and public forums if they

787
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
shouldn't be underestimated they

788
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,919
outperformed on results when compared to

789
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,679
perceived quality and landed in third

790
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,880
place

791
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,600
however have a system in mind and focus

792
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,960
on what the results are that you're

793
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,679
looking to get

794
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,080
when we look at how and why individuals

795
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,760
participate

796
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,640
data information intelligence they're

797
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
all important and for different people

798
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
at different levels

799
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,679
key advantages included access to an

800
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,480
awareness of actionable timely content

801
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,919
so when you're contributing when you're

802
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,279
offering things think about it through

803
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,360
that lens as well that will be rated as

804
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,840
more valuable

805
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,919
it's really not a matter of if you

806
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,840
should there was no controversy around

807
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
that but how

808
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,640
there's a high level of value of

809
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,799
encouragement placed

810
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,799
on um

811
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,039
cti networking for all levels

812
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,799
and we took a little intermission data

813
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,720
intermission to cover some key advice by

814
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,840
and for all of you to participate to be

815
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,159
trustworthy and to always be careful and

816
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,080
strategic

817
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
and then finally looking at the role

818
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,720
that organizations play

819
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
for for the most part it's pretty much

820
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
on you

821
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,760
organizations are currently lacking in

822
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
structures and incentives around cti

823
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
networking and integrating that with

824
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,520
plan

825
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
and even though this type of networking

826
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
for your work is directly related to

827
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,480
security posture is directly related to

828
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
cdi programs and results

829
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,480
it's mostly seen as a personal

830
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,159
undertaking

831
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,240
and it's time to acknowledge impact on

832
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,200
cti programs as an asset and not as an

833
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,760
afterthought

834
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,360
so with this initial benchmark i hope to

835
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,760
push the field towards more effective

836
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,000
inclusive and strategic cti networking

837
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,559
efforts and lay the ground floor for

838
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,880
what's going on

839
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,679
looking at where i would go from here

840
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,600
a larger survey first off

841
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
this research it had a lot of

842
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,960
limitations right the survey was done

843
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,360
with a grand budget of zero dollars my

844
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,840
own time and dime and uh dan my uh

845
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,480
co-founding partners support he's in the

846
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
chat too so feel free to bug him

847
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,960
it would be really great to see a more

848
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,039
representative sample size uh not just

849
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,360
by like a larger volume but employer

850
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,159
types international representation

851
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,679
i might need some translators for that

852
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
to be honest

853
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,919
uh second inclu inclusive and

854
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,559
exclusionary culture that got a ton of

855
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,159
interest since the very beginning i got

856
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,840
a lot of questions before during and

857
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,159
after i was working on these drafts and

858
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,000
this would explore you know the name of

859
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
the game you know these two days the

860
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,640
impact of biases of groupthink and other

861
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,120
prejudices that are hindering networks

862
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,200
and creating barriers to building the

863
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,000
diversity that benefits us all

864
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
several biases were already touched on

865
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
by other presentations with other lenses

866
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
but that really applies to networking as

867
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,440
well

868
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,360
third guidance by career levels let's

869
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,799
dig deeper into the different

870
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,640
requirements and approaches for

871
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,360
individuals at entry or mid or senior

872
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,279
career stages

873
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,760
and then finally a direct follow-up from

874
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,559
our last section company case studies do

875
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,640
you work with a company that plans with

876
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,399
networking in mind

877
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,559
has it been done how did you fight over

878
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,919
sharing efforts and restrictions with

879
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,919
parent organizations

880
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,399
here read research attempts both success

881
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,480
and failures if i can find them

882
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,200
of org strategies that somehow somehow

883
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,840
tied cti networking to program maturity

884
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,879
plans operations

885
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,840
uh here are some sources that help me

886
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
define and refine this research and i'll

887
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,360
share this deck and list with all the

888
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,240
attendees as well

889
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760

890
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,919
still good i'm so glad you joined my

891
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,760
talk today covering the current state

892
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,159
and the potential of networking in cti

893
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,159
the full report can be found with this

894
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,919
link if there's findings additional

895
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,159
insights data summaries it's also shared

896
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,399
in the channel i pinned it earlier

897
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,320
if you heard something in this talk that

898
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,760
you're excited to use if you were

899
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,880
sharing something in your next team

900
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,200
meeting if you have a burning question

901
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,039
if you have two cents that you'd like to

902
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,760
donate into my opinion coffer please do

903
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,399
shoot a note in the slack or send a dm

904
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,080
and for those who are asynchronous or

905
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,480
not in the slack my contact information

906
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
is also at the bottom so i'm really

907
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
excited to hear from you and i'm happy

908
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,399
and excited to continue building off of

909
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,639
this baseline
