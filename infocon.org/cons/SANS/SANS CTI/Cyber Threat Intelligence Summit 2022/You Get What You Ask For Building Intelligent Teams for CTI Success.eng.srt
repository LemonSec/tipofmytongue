5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,079

between your cti team or any team you're

having me i'm so excited to be a part of

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
the presentation with katie today

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,600
um so i think the the the key highlights

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
of of myself here with red canary is i

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,439
would call myself a very

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
employee-centric talent leader with 20

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
years of experience

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,640
i've worked with companies of many many

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,960
different sizes and scales and i think

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,079
that

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,520
you know have fun googling

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
self-determination theory later it's

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
kind of the foundation of everything we

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
build but essentially everything you're

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,560
going to learn here today for myself and

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
katie is just what does it look like

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
when you take a very employee

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
talent-centered approach to your talent

53
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,119
systems and it begins with recruiting so

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,560
really excited to be with you here today

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
and here's our agenda right we're

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
teaming up we're going to talk about

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,960
basically three key areas

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
planning planning to succeed defining

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,318
our expectations and then actually

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,479
selecting talent doing that hiring

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
melanie's going to talk from a talent

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
perspective and then i'm going to talk

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
from about intel perspective so you'll

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,319
get these same points from two different

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,879
perspectives

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,800
one of the things that

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,040
that may surprise you is most of my

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
presentation is about what you do before

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,319
you ever post a job

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
um pre-work makes the dream work

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
and so one of the things that we do here

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
at red canary is we really try to take

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,360
this approach that most of your hiring

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
is actually done before the role is ever

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
posted so what do we mean by that

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,160
um

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
if you're going to bring

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
it's a very competitive market it's a

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
very competitive field

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
and if you are going to be competing for

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,640
top talent what does top talent want

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
when they come to work with you and they

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,920
give you the gift of their experience

84
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
and skill and unique perspectives

85
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,160
they want to know how to be successful

86
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,720
and so in order for us to set our team

87
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,239
members up for success we have to be

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,720
able to understand as a hiring leader

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
what do we need in the role what's the

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
right skill level

91
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,080
what do we expect how will we measure

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
somebody's success when they join us how

93
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,519
will you know that you made the right

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
hire within 90 days

95
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
who's going to be most engaged in the

96
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
role so before you even think of hiring

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,239
asking yourself what career level do i

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
need how much time do i have to coach

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and develop this individual do i need

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
somebody who's more at a senior level

101
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
who can really help me develop the rest

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
of my team and so answering these

103
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,200
questions thinking about your current

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
team makeup before you even get ready to

105
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,519
post a role will really help make sure

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,000
that you find the right talent aligned

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
to the stage of your company the

108
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,440
experience the level of independence

109
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
they're going to have and the level of

110
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
experience you need to augment your team

111
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
so so many of these questions that we've

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
got listed here katie and i tried to

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
incorporate as many tools and takeaways

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,959
for you so we wanted to give you a list

115
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
of kind of pre-planning questions here

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,159
to take with you

117
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,760
when you're thinking about how to set

118
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,200
expectations katie and i thought it

119
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
might be helpful just to show you some

120
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,799
of the things that we do at red canary

121
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,840
um

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,799
we think of talent as a system and so

123
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
when we think about defining success we

124
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
really start at the career level of

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
articulating for every canary what does

126
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,959
your success look like as an individual

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,160
contributor

128
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,478
as a senior team member as a principal

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
and then we do the same thing for the

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
entire leadership track

131
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,600
what that does is it really does help us

132
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
set and measure expectations so for

133
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,479
example

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,120
if i'm if i'm hiring a team member and

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
what i really need for them is to give

136
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
them very little direction they've got

137
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,240
best practices to pull from i want to

138
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
align on priorities and then just set

139
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,280
them free to work

140
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
um then that's exactly what i want to

141
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
look for in a team member but if i hire

142
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,120
somebody who's an individual contributor

143
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
and i expect them to have that level of

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
self-direction i might not be setting

145
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
them up to succeed and i might not have

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
the right expectations as a leader and

147
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,919
so that's what we're talking about how

148
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,240
do you define and measure success it's

149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,720
when we think of talent as a system

150
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
so at red canary we have career level

151
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,400
behavioral competencies that we've

152
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,919
defined

153
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,360
and that also helps us shift our

154
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
identity when we're moving through our

155
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
career track

156
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
how do i focus my personal development

157
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,759
right and so we do a good job of

158
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
defining that for our team members we

159
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,880
also define expectations um for every

160
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
role within the company so for example

161
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
as an intel analyst what does it mean to

162
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
look like as a senior as a principal

163
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
and how can you make sure that you're

164
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,039
advancing not only what you know but how

165
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,639
you're performing and how you're

166
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
interacting with the team and i think

167
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
many of you probably have had that

168
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,280
experience

169
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,400
personally

170
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,840
where it's not what we know but it's how

171
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
we work that sometimes we'll be

172
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,240
successful or maybe get in our own way

173
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
and so the ways that we do that with the

174
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
role specific criteria we have dedicated

175
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,320
career paths to all of our canaries

176
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,759
we take a lot of time to write our

177
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
position descriptions and we also have

178
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
30 60 90 day plans which we'll show you

179
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
in just a moment and then our

180
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,400
compensation model and pay transparency

181
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,240
we absolutely connect every single

182
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
career level to a set level um for pay

183
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
so that you can see your path and you

184
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
can see how you'll progress

185
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,319
through the entire system

186
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
here's a quick screenshot for you what

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
do i mean when i say career level

188
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
competencies we're talking about

189
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
behaviors that really help you to be

190
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,759
successful so if you can see our fine

191
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,360
print you'll notice that as an

192
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
individual contributor we're defining

193
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,199
success it's really about the actions

194
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,199
you're taking it's about the quantity of

195
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,120
work it's about demonstrating

196
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,440
self-awareness being coachable

197
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
um you know being really resilient to

198
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,759
change in feedback

199
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,360
learning how to be customer focused and

200
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
sometimes that means saying no

201
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
and then valuing difference so that we

202
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
have diversity and inclusion within our

203
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
team so at red canary this is what we've

204
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,880
defined as success right at the

205
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,479
beginning of your career so it's a great

206
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,639
foundation to grow on and then you can

207
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,400
see when you start to move to the senior

208
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
individual contributor

209
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,240
it's not about the number of things you

210
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
do it's about quality and it's about

211
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,840
decision making so this is just an

212
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
example to make that real for you how do

213
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,120
we

214
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
connect this to our talent and our

215
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
hiring we have interview questions that

216
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,919
are connected to each one of these

217
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,719
career levels

218
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,599
and then we tie it when i say talent is

219
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,360
a system the things that we say define

220
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,199
your success we then measure your

221
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
performance against that in a very very

222
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,120
collaborative way between leaders and

223
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
their team members to make sure that

224
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
they're getting all sorts of feedback so

225
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,639
having talent as a system what this

226
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
means is when katie goes to hire

227
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
somebody at an individual senior or

228
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
principal level she already knows what

229
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
she's expecting how to set expectations

230
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
manage results give them performance

231
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
feedback and now she's going to make an

232
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,080
exceptional hire because katie has been

233
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,319
so thoughtful in her process of what

234
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,560
she's expecting

235
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
here's an example uh we'll walk you

236
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
through what we do from a position

237
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,879
description again

238
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
all of this is before we've even posted

239
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,039
a job because it's helping us understand

240
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
how to find the right fit for the role

241
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,720
for the stage of company and so here's

242
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
an example of a position description

243
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
that katie wrote with recruiting for a

244
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,560
senior intelligence engineer

245
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
um and when we're thinking about

246
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
attracting the right talent it's really

247
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,080
important to make sure that we're

248
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,319
helping resonate out who are we from a

249
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,840
culture and a values perspective and

250
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
attracting people who are excited to

251
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
kind of climb that hill and take on your

252
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,319
mission

253
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
what we believe in red canary is very

254
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
anchored in our in our values and so we

255
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,680
really want to resonate out to people

256
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
are you aligned are these things

257
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
important to you come join us and so

258
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,400
this is really important on your

259
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,759
position descriptions that you're

260
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,199
resonating out

261
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,880
um who we are

262
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
um and how that's going to feel to be

263
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,839
here and if it feels like you're going

264
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,120
to be able to perform in a way that

265
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,640
feels authentic for you that you can

266
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
bring your best self to work

267
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,880
these things help people decide if we're

268
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,399
a destination employer or if this

269
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
doesn't sound like the right fit

270
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
so a lot of your position description is

271
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,560
really designed and understanding not

272
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
only who wants to take the job but

273
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
helping people understand oh that

274
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,720
doesn't really seem

275
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
like a good fit for me so helping people

276
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,319
self-select out right from the start

277
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,480
this next piece that we include on all

278
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
of our position descriptions is related

279
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
to the challenges that you'll solve so

280
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
when you think about that

281
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
self-determination theory that i

282
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
introduced in one quick bullet it really

283
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
is the foundation what we believe people

284
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
need to be successful when they come to

285
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,240
work they need a sense of autonomy

286
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
they need a sense of competence and a

287
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
sense of connection

288
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
so our position description is very very

289
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
intricately tied to that philosophy of

290
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,920
self-determination theory so the

291
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,360
challenge is it really helps somebody

292
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
understand the scope of the role how

293
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,959
much autonomy will they have do they

294
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
have a lot of ability to decide what and

295
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,880
how where is this more a role where

296
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
we've already decided what and we're

297
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,880
asking you to be an expert and execute

298
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,200
with your subject matter expertise some

299
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
of us love roles where we have a lot of

300
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
room to make those decisions and some of

301
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
us are really more motivated by using

302
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,360
our deep subject matter expertise

303
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
so this challenges you'll solve as our

304
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
way of communicating to people scope of

305
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
impact they'll have how they're going to

306
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,160
work

307
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
and the projects that they're going to

308
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
take on is this something they're

309
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
feeling like they have the ability to do

310
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,279
is this a stretch roll those are all of

311
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,320
the things that we're trying to

312
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,760
communicate

313
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,040
with the position description

314
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
and then of course we have more

315
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,079
traditional sections what you'll do we

316
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,600
want to paint a picture of what the day

317
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
to day looks like

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
and then also what people will bring to

319
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,959
the table

320
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
at red canary you'll notice our position

321
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
descriptions do not

322
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,680
include

323
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,320
university degrees and things like that

324
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
we want to include only job requirements

325
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
that are really going to help you be

326
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
successful in the role

327
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
this is because we don't want to

328
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,120
inadvertently

329
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
remove candidates from the process and

330
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
so being very thoughtful at the

331
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
beginning part of your process on what

332
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
does it really take to do the job

333
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,079
and katie is going to walk you through

334
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
the details of how she looks at required

335
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
versus preferred

336
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,120
qualifications in her section

337
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,000
before we even post a job all of our

338
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
hiring leaders create a 30 60 90 day

339
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,600
plan

340
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
what this does is it helps the leader

341
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,959
understand

342
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,480
what should my new person because the

343
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
position description we just showed you

344
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,480
um it's complex right there's a lot to

345
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
master there over the period of this job

346
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,959
and so this is really the opportunity

347
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,800
for a hiring leader to say

348
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
hey in your first 30 days please focus

349
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,760
on these

350
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
very very specific things that's how i'm

351
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
going to measure your success

352
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,680
once you hit 60 days here's what i want

353
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,480
you to have learned and after 90 days so

354
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
an onboarding plan will help set your

355
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
employee up for

356
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,160
what processes do i have to learn and

357
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,640
more answers the question of what

358
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
30 60 90 day plans are different than an

359
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,360
onboarding training they really say

360
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
success looks like this and it's the

361
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,160
beginning of a foundation of feedback

362
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
and growth and development and just

363
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,079
really starts you off with really

364
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,359
engaged conversations

365
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
all right so now we're going to talk

366
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
about hiring itself

367
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,560
we've done all of our pre-work we've

368
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
prepared we know what we expect we know

369
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
the career level we're looking for we

370
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
know exactly how we're going to measure

371
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,279
their success

372
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,519
and so now we have some best practices

373
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
to share with you around

374
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,720
talent selection right so when you set

375
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
up your interview process we're looking

376
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,720
for things like creating interview

377
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
guides and so this is where it's really

378
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,519
important for diversity and inclusion to

379
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,279
measure people against a standard it

380
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
really mitigates unconscious bias in the

381
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
talent selection development and

382
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
promotion process it's one of the most

383
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
important reasons that red canary looks

384
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
at talent as a system being able to

385
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,079
define success to measure people against

386
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
criteria means that we're not

387
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
accidentally comparing people against

388
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,279
our own bias

389
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,279
many of us will kind of select talent

390
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,040
that kind of operate a lot like us it's

391
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,279
called the just like me bias and so

392
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
building in diversity uh into our teams

393
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
how we think how we act how we perform

394
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,720
is so important to our overall success

395
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
so at red canary we have an interview

396
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,560
guide for every job that we post

397
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,639
it goes through and it articulates who

398
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,720
is involved in the interview process how

399
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
many steps do we have what questions are

400
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
being asked by everybody at the step in

401
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
the process um i'm guessing that many of

402
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,959
you encountered moments where you're in

403
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,560
a hiring process and somebody says hey

404
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,399
will you please join a panel and you're

405
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
like great and what they do is send you

406
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,880
somebody's resume and a meeting invite

407
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,399
you're like oh goodness i don't even

408
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,000
know what they've talked about yet i

409
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,279
don't know what i'm supposed to learn

410
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,720
about this candidate

411
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
and now the candidate has asked the same

412
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
set of questions seven times in a row

413
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
not a great experience for candidates

414
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,560
and also

415
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
it really um

416
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
shortchanges that candidate's ability to

417
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,440
show us holistically who they are and

418
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
what they bring to the table

419
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,199
and so designing a very thoughtful

420
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,199
process where you literally list each

421
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,199
step and what you're trying to learn

422
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,440
about the candidate at every single step

423
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
in the journey and then on the other

424
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,800
side your talent partner is going to

425
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,160
help that candidate and say hey you're

426
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
meeting with katie she's going to want

427
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,880
to talk about your experience in x

428
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
so we want to make sure that we're

429
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
setting up the tone of transparency and

430
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,320
trust right from the beginning of the

431
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,720
interview process and as a hiring leader

432
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
please think of this as an opportunity

433
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,240
to build trust with candidates through

434
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,560
the process whether you select them

435
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
or don't select them we're not trying to

436
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,920
trick them we're trying to show them

437
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
that our sincere desire is to make them

438
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,680
successful in the process and if they

439
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,360
join us that's the commitment we have to

440
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
them is when they become our employee

441
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
and our team member will have that equal

442
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
level of commitment to make them

443
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,839
successful and make sure they know where

444
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,440
they stand at all times with us and how

445
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880
to get better

446
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
so those are really important things to

447
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,720
set yourself up to be a great leader for

448
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,800
this individual

449
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,880
at red canary we also do panel

450
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,480
preparation meetings

451
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
so we have the interview guide that says

452
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,920
here's all of the steps here's what

453
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,760
we're learning at each step here's the

454
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
feedback form you're going to fill out

455
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,880
so you know exactly

456
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
just some interview questions they're

457
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,839
all behavior-based

458
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,959
um

459
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
and then having a standard candidate

460
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,279
feedback form so everybody is answering

461
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,959
the same questions about every single

462
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,120
candidate i think sometimes what we can

463
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
do is we start talking with a candidate

464
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,399
and we can get really interested about

465
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,560
something we've got in common and now

466
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
every candidate is not having the same

467
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,839
experience and the same opportunity to

468
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,000
tell us about themselves

469
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,519
and so this is another one of those

470
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,959
things that just really mitigates

471
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,480
unconscious bias in our interview

472
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
process and gives us the ability to

473
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,519
assess each candidate consistently

474
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,360
after the entire panel has taken place

475
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
we do debrief meetings as well where we

476
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,440
get together and give feedback about the

477
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,959
candidate

478
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,639
and we get to all holistically learn

479
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
more about the different things that we

480
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,519
learned through the five steps in our

481
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,920
process

482
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,199
the other advice that i would give you

483
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
before we talk about melanie's favorite

484
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,959
questions is when you have a panel

485
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,399
helping you out make this important

486
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
hiring decision please make sure

487
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
everybody understands their role

488
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,839
sometimes people are on a panel and they

489
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,839
believe they've got veto power if that's

490
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,759
the case then yes please make sure they

491
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
know that but if they're providing input

492
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
to assess technical skills for you

493
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,519
please make sure that they know that

494
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,959
that's where their their feedback is

495
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,120
most valuable and helpful to assess the

496
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
whole candidate

497
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
and everybody knowing what type of

498
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,920
feedback they're giving what kind of

499
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,000
influence they have will make everybody

500
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
feel like they're more um bought into

501
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,079
that candidate when they are selected

502
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,680
and join your team it just

503
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,600
keeps expectations aligned across your

504
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
panel

505
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,639
um here are some of my favorite

506
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,079
interview questions again katie and i

507
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,600
wanted to give you a lot of takeaway

508
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,199
tools

509
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,199
when i'm interviewing a candidate

510
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
i'm really trying to learn some

511
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,560
important things about them

512
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,320
everybody can learn some new skills and

513
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
so if somebody doesn't have exactly what

514
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
you're looking for from a skill set

515
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,839
understanding these things about their

516
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,519
motivators will help you understand if

517
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,199
they're going to be coachable and if

518
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,800
this is the right opportunity for the

519
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
stage of career so here's some of my

520
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
favorites

521
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,920
um i like asking people to reflect on

522
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
their career journey and ask if there

523
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
are themes that they notice about their

524
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,759
favorite roles their favorite leaders

525
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,680
the favorite companies they've been with

526
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,199
and how they know when they're ready for

527
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,600
a new challenge so i don't directly ask

528
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,360
them why did you leave the last job why

529
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
did you do this because i want to see

530
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
how self-reflective and self-aware they

531
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,199
are do they notice that what leads them

532
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,400
to leave is when they've learned

533
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,839
everything they can learn and they leave

534
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,000
on good footing do they leave because of

535
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,599
conflict with managers and we've all

536
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
been there so that's okay if that's why

537
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,039
they left too

538
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
but this first question is really asking

539
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,319
them to to demonstrate their

540
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,599
self-awareness

541
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,439
um asking what they're hoping to get in

542
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
this role that they are not getting now

543
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,439
really helps us align oh what they're

544
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,880
hoping to get is not actually what i

545
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,559
have to offer i don't think they're

546
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,080
going to be really engaged or happy in

547
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,600
this role

548
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,039
what's the most helpful feedback that

549
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,559
you've ever received let somebody share

550
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
their self-awareness it lets them show

551
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,320
you if they're coachable if they take

552
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
feedback and how much they are invested

553
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,880
in their own growth

554
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
what advice would you give to me as your

555
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,640
future leader um

556
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,080
i think sometimes we put a lot of

557
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
pressures on leaders that it's really up

558
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
to them to know how to motivate how to

559
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
do things for people gosh that's a

560
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
one-way street and it's not it's not a

561
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,039
two-way relationship and our

562
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,240
relationship should really be

563
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,799
collaborative and so finding out if they

564
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,080
are comfortable telling us what they

565
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,520
want to need

566
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,280
the stakes are low in an interview right

567
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,720
they haven't they don't feel like

568
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
they're going to lose their job with us

569
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
yet so it's a great time to ask that

570
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
question

571
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,640
um

572
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
how can i support your growth and how

573
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,240
will you measure my success right so

574
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
you're being thoughtful about creating a

575
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
foundation for your relationship before

576
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,120
they even come on board you're

577
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,039
establishing that this is going to be

578
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,039
two-way we're going to give feedback

579
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,120
we're going to have a relationship built

580
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
on mutual benefit and success

581
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,480
so those are my favorite questions

582
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
um i've talked a lot about how we leave

583
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
diversity equity and inclusion

584
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,039
our pay system is very very clear and

585
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
specific we have criteria for every pay

586
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
change so that everybody is moved

587
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,280
consistently and equitably through our

588
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
system it's one of the benefits of

589
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,000
having a talent system in place

590
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,440
and then katie and i also wanted to

591
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,760
share with you just what are some common

592
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,000
forms of unconscious bias we all have it

593
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
because we're human the trick isn't to

594
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
be perfect and not have unconscious bias

595
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,559
that is an unrealistic expectation

596
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,320
but what is really important is that we

597
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
understand where we have unconscious

598
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,080
bias so that we can mitigate it and kind

599
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
of just notice the moments where it's

600
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
coming up for us so here are some of the

601
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,600
most common

602
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,400
um

603
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
common kinds of bias that you can have a

604
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
chance to read through

605
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,640
as you go through the process katie i'm

606
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,120
sure everyone is really excited to hear

607
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
your perspective on the hiring process

608
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,320
what kinds of things do you think about

609
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
as you move through this katie

610
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,160
i build on the foundations that you just

611
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,600
set up

612
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
and yeah thank you so much melanie we're

613
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
getting so many great questions in slack

614
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,400
and

615
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
you know i think that someone commented

616
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
right those questions sound like an hr

617
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,840
talent perspective absolutely right i

618
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,600
rely on melanie and her team and our

619
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,120
amazing recruiters

620
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
to go in and kind of get a sense of a

621
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,679
candidate overall is it the right

622
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,240
company and then my team comes in we ask

623
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,200
the cti specific questions but we still

624
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,039
have to do a lot of planning and the

625
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,440
same follow those same processes that

626
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,240
melanie's talent team sets up for us

627
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
right plan to succeed um one thing that

628
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,799
i've started doing and this has really

629
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,960
been in my growth as a manager and

630
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,919
leader

631
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,400
is trying to plan ahead for the skill

632
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
sets that i need based on what i want to

633
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,760
do in the team

634
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,000
all right and so having even if it's

635
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
right really simple on a white board a

636
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,640
napkin in a spreadsheet having some kind

637
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
of a rough strategic plan

638
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
what are the things my team's gonna do

639
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,360
this year this quarter this month

640
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
to try to anticipate the people you're

641
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,720
going to need to make those goals happen

642
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
one other thing i always look for as i'm

643
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,240
bringing someone onto the team

644
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
and i don't love the term culture i try

645
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,799
to get away from that um

646
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
i love the red canary culture but when i

647
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,799
say culture i mean adherence to core

648
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,960
values like doing what's right for our

649
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,360
customers being kind and authentic

650
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
culture can have really gross

651
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
connotations and so if i use the word

652
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
culture i always try to think about a

653
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,480
culture ad

654
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,799
not a term that i don't love culture fit

655
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
which can sort of be a signal for

656
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
right being just like me

657
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
i think about what in terms of culture

658
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
in terms of behaviors in terms of skill

659
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,919
set is a new hire going to add to my

660
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,880
team

661
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,640
and to really know the skill sets you

662
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,039
need you have to plan ahead so here's

663
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,520
sort of a rough idea of maybe what a

664
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
strategic plan could look like at a high

665
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
level for a cti leader or you could do

666
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
this right for a sock lead or any kind

667
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
of security leader

668
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
quarter one we're gonna start a new

669
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,360
product line right okay we're gonna need

670
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,520
a lot of strong writers here maybe we

671
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,720
need to bring in someone with a really

672
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
strong writing background could we find

673
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
a former journalist right if someone has

674
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
that skill set and i'm looking for that

675
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,440
having that in mind really helps you

676
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
know and then your recruiter your talent

677
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
team can be looking up for hey katie

678
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,919
needs some writing skill sets let's look

679
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,039
for that

680
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,640
maybe the next quarter my team's going

681
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,240
to evaluate threat intelligence

682
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
platforms

683
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,679
i flagged this as a major gap because no

684
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,880
one in my team has used a tip before so

685
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
we probably need to bring in someone

686
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,400
with experience there another example of

687
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
how identifying planning ahead your

688
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,919
goals can help you figure out what

689
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,840
talent you need to bring in

690
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
all right okay executive communication

691
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
we have really strong communicators on

692
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,000
our team let's just build someone up and

693
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,320
prepare them later in this year to step

694
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
into that role

695
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,000
maybe we need to integrate with other

696
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
teams right we have talks later on from

697
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
samara on integrated intelligence and

698
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
maybe if we need to talk to our threat

699
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
hunters more we should find someone with

700
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
a threat hunting background we're

701
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,559
looking beyond next year let's do dark

702
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,400
web let's do different sources again

703
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,679
thinking about

704
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
what you want to do in your team and

705
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
where you want to go

706
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,640
to bring in the people who are going to

707
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
be the best ad to your team

708
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
setting expectations

709
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,360
i'm such a fan of everything that

710
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,280
melanie laid out in terms of right

711
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,080
having expectations for different levels

712
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,039
and roles because if you don't tell

713
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,520
someone what you expect of them how can

714
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,640
you

715
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
expect them to meet it right and that's

716
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
so much i think of what the problem is

717
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,360
between manager employee i have these

718
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
ideas in my brain oh well someone should

719
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,840
act like this and they don't know what

720
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,000
i'm mean by that or they don't have the

721
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
same expectations so one thing that i

722
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
found especially in cti teams is that

723
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
sometimes there are slightly different

724
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
roles in cti teams

725
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
when i first came on to the team we were

726
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
all intelligence analysts

727
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,280
and i found that i came to the team i

728
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
kind of brought my baggage and my

729
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
background and traditional intel counter

730
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,240
intelligence on what i thought an intel

731
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,919
analyst should do

732
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,360
but what i found when i came into the

733
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,279
team of course there are so many

734
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,200
different skill sets and someone is

735
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
amazing at threat hunting right good at

736
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,640
poking at malware great at coding and so

737
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
what i realized is hey for our team we

738
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
need different roles because my

739
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
expectations for my intel analyst are

740
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,240
very different than my malware analyst

741
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,000
so we broke our team into three

742
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
different roles right we have manager

743
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
director then intel analyst

744
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,960
analyzes data information writes

745
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,159
products

746
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,960
our analyst analyzes malware works with

747
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,039
those intel analysts and then intel

748
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
engineer who really are coders people

749
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
who create the tooling to enable the

750
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,279
rest of the team

751
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,760
so for us that was a useful breakdown

752
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,360
you might find different ways of

753
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
breaking down your team

754
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,200
as i was struggling with this i reached

755
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,159
out to

756
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,320
rick rebecca a lot of other cti leaders

757
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,159
i know and said how do you divide your

758
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,360
teams

759
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
some teams are divided by a regional or

760
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,840
country focus so maybe you have those

761
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,320
different uh breakdowns

762
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,799
type of adversary does someone track

763
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,880
hacktivists versus ransomware versus

764
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,799
state sponsored

765
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,720
strategic versus tactical this is a

766
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,159
common one i heard and this is

767
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,159
especially where you might have very

768
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,240
different expectations for a strategic

769
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,679
intel analyst

770
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,240
versus a tactical intel analyst as well

771
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,840
as different skill sets you're looking

772
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
for there

773
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
you could divide by analysts were

774
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
collecting data and producing

775
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,279
intelligence you could divide by the

776
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,799
requirements that they're supporting

777
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,200
maybe one analyst supports one team so

778
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,799
they need to know a lot about threat

779
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,760
hunting another supports executive

780
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,960
leadership

781
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,440
very different expectations a lot of

782
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,039
different ways you could break this down

783
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,880
but think about for your cti team

784
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,320
specifically

785
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,400
do i have different expectations of

786
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,480
different types of roles on my team

787
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,039
position descriptions melanie gave you a

788
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,799
preview of how we write position

789
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,799
descriptions at red canary and i really

790
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
like that format and something that i

791
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
reflected on throughout my career and

792
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,799
experienced myself is right the

793
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,559
self-opting out

794
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,520
of applications and i saw in slack right

795
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
a lot of people saying well you know i

796
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,240
didn't want to apply for the role

797
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,080
because i was scared i wouldn't qualify

798
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,159
and i think position descriptions are so

799
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,080
important with this and one thing i try

800
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
to be really thoughtful about

801
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,360
is if something is really required

802
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
or if it's just preferred

803
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,760
and what i do as a mental check for this

804
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
is think about okay if an amazing

805
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,440
candidate walked in

806
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
and they had so many great attributes

807
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,120
and aspects and they could add so much

808
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
to the team

809
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,880
but they didn't have this one thing

810
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,279
would i still hire them

811
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,240
if yes then it's probably not a required

812
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,640
thing right it's probably not a required

813
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,360
skill and so we've talked about and

814
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,559
lillian's going to be talking about in

815
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,559
her keynote tomorrow diversity equity

816
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,039
and inclusion are so key in cyber threat

817
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,600
intel and making sure that you have the

818
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,000
right required versus preferred skill

819
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,240
sets is really crucial to make sure you

820
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
get a really diverse broad pool of

821
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,640
applicants

822
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,200
here's an example right i recently had a

823
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,360
role closed now for an intelligence

824
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,640
analyst

825
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,799
a requirement right what you'll bring

826
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,720
you need to bring an understanding a

827
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,880
general understanding of endpoint

828
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,360
adversary behaviors in attack

829
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,039
cool that's the general requirement if

830
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,640
you don't have that i don't feel like

831
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,039
you can be successful in this role

832
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,760
however how you got that skill set might

833
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,640
differ

834
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,480
right and so if you have experience

835
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,360
working a sock or in a d4 role

836
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,039
cool that's that's preferred that might

837
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,559
give you a leg up to have a better

838
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,919
understanding to meet that first

839
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
requirement but it's not required

840
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,360
because maybe i have an amazing analyst

841
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,799
who's transitioning from being a

842
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,200
journalist like selena larsen who talked

843
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,240
last year or one of my team members used

844
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
to be a professional dancer and she went

845
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,880
got her master's she's brilliant so

846
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
right thinking about what's preferred

847
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,440
versus required helps you really hone in

848
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,559
on the right talent for your team

849
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,360
now hiring itself right as melanie said

850
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,120
and this is something that you know she

851
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,320
and talent team have helped me

852
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,600
understand is

853
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,840
there's so much prep honestly the hiring

854
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,640
piece is the easier part and one of the

855
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,880
things that my team does in our hiring

856
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,559
uh for the intelligence team is have

857
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,559
assessment questions

858
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,760
now i know this is a little bit

859
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
controversial

860
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,159
and i do this thoughtfully

861
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,919
the reason that i chose to include

862
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,080
assessment questions in our application

863
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
is that it gives me as a hiring manager

864
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
and our team a sense of how candidates

865
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,200
think

866
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,320
how they respond how they reason through

867
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,480
the other benefit is on the candidate

868
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
side

869
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
it gives them a sense of the type of

870
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,840
work we do because our questions aren't

871
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,679
you know weird coding whiteboard

872
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,600
questions that's not what our team does

873
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,679
they're based on things we do every

874
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,279
single day

875
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,960
so sometimes candidates will look at

876
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,600
that and say hey this isn't really in my

877
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,919
wheelhouse and that's okay that gives

878
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,600
them a sense of this might not be the

879
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
right match

880
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
i do acknowledge these questions take

881
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,120
time from analysts and so i encourage

882
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
any hiring managers out there be

883
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,360
thoughtful don't give someone something

884
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,000
that's going to take 40 hours but i like

885
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,480
to say one to two hours and i've had

886
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,000
good feedback on these questions

887
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
analysts saying that they actually

888
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,440
really enjoyed going through

889
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
so as we start to come to the end here

890
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,279
right a couple example questions

891
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,200
right this is one i have where you

892
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,120
present some telemetry from a fake

893
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
detection

894
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,799
and then ask an analyst in no more than

895
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,440
a few paragraphs which is a tough job to

896
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,720
be brief

897
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,480
right tell us what threats you think

898
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
this is

899
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,279
what evidence you used to reach this

900
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,440
conclusion what would you suggest

901
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
someone do if they saw this

902
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,840
what gaps you saw and right it's

903
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,279
probably not a coincidence these are all

904
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,640
things that you've heard his themes

905
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,399
throughout the summit right thinking

906
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,240
about evidence thinking about gaps etc

907
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,919
so we ask these questions and then

908
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,440
present a snippet of some telemetry from

909
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,080
a real detection that we have seen

910
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,840
and this is one of the tasks my analysts

911
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,440
perform every day as they go into the

912
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,840
detections we see and they say cool this

913
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,640
review report exe what threat is this

914
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,720
how could we inform better decisions

915
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,640
another example question

916
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
many cti teams get requests for

917
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
information all right so here's an

918
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
example a small u.s bank who's our

919
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,399
customer says they're concerned about

920
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,399
pegasus spyware and they want to know

921
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,760
right what should they do about it

922
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
should they be worried

923
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,559
this is such an open-ended question

924
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,799
there's no one right way to answer this

925
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,960
but what i'm looking for here is right

926
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,200
can analysts do some basic threat

927
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,360
modeling can they think through

928
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,440
open source research can they do that

929
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
can they figure out how to respond to a

930
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,679
customer because again this is part of

931
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,279
our everyday role

932
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,960
so i think assessment questions can be

933
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,799
powerful you have to make sure they

934
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,120
relate to your day-to-day in a real way

935
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,039
and be respectful of the candidate's

936
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,279
time

937
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,440
couple final interview practices this is

938
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,880
something i've done in the last round

939
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,480
and i really love this

940
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,320
to go towards the goal that melanie

941
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,559
mentioned right being as equitable as

942
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,919
possible

943
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,799
having core questions that you ask

944
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,120
everyone it's really helpful because you

945
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
can start to compare those answers and

946
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,600
hedge against those biases

947
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,840
other hiring tips right mix up those

948
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,399
hiring teams i like to have some of my

949
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,399
more endpoint telemetry focused analysts

950
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,600
my malware analyst my strategic analyst

951
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,080
include everyone different perspectives

952
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
even from a different team

953
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
and then make sure everyone's feedback

954
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,600
is heard the hiring manager makes a

955
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,519
decision but listen to everyone's

956
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,200
perspective that's some of the benefit

957
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,679
of having a diverse hiring team and an

958
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,760
interviewing team because sometimes one

959
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
person will see something that another

960
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
haven't

961
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,679
here's an example of one of those core

962
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,919
questions in action and now i have to

963
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,159
retire this one but i love it because

964
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,519
it's so simple

965
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,519
tell me about the diamond model

966
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,840
right first analyst first candidate says

967
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,120
okay it's adversary victim

968
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,519
infrastructure capability

969
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,679
cool that's a right answer

970
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,840
analyst 2 says well i can't really

971
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,360
remember the parts i haven't worked with

972
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,279
it but i know the diamond model is all

973
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,679
about structuring intrusions and it's a

974
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,159
really powerful way we can divide data

975
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,600
and start to cluster together and look

976
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
for commonalities

977
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,080
maybe that's not a right answer but man

978
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,000
that answer would blow me away

979
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,240
right and maybe someone else says hey

980
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,600
haven't used diamond but i've used

981
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
attack let me tell you about that so

982
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,159
just an example of how right there's no

983
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,480
right or wrong answer but asking that

984
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,519
same question can help compare across

985
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,360
candidates

986
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,200
to wrap up a couple takeaways right

987
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,799
hopefully you've learned by melanie and

988
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,480
i being on here together

989
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
work with your talent or hr team i

990
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,919
realize that's tougher for some of you

991
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,399
than others i'm really fortunate but

992
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,880
remember that prep work really key to

993
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,399
finding the right talent setting

994
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,960
expectations as well and if you do all

995
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,320
of these things we've talked about or

996
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,080
even some of them you'll have a better

997
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,200
chance at building your cti team

998
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
red canary careers page um you can find

999
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,519
we have sort of a general application if

1000
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,960
you don't have any we don't have a match

1001
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
right now you can apply for that and
