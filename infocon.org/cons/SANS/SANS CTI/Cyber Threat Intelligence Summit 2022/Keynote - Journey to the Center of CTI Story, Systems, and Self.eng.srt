1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,440
i am um super excited to introduce becca

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,120
not just because we're friends but

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
because she's an amazing speaker is this

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,719
going to be your is this your fourth

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,440
time becca i it's third or fourth time

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,800
right i don't even remember yeah

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
the pandemic makes it hard to think

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,840
about uh to think about uh things but uh

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,439
you know rebecca's done some really fun

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,439
stuff with the summit the last time we

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,000
are in person she was a driving force

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,040
between uh for jeopardy and she was

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,320
trebekah

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
alex trebeka brown which was pretty

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
entertaining um also one something

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,280
actually quote could be monthly and

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
people on my team probably

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
know that i have said this but there was

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,000
i think it may have been your first talk

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
for cti summit probably four or five

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
years ago and you talked about open

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
source and you said open source was like

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
puppies like yeah somebody gives you a

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,280
puppy it's free but that doesn't mean

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
there's not a lot of work associated

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,719
with with it and that that works for

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,559
open source intelligence that works for

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,799
open source threat intelligence tools so

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,960
that's just one of many you know ear

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
worms that when your name comes up that

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,119
just pops into my head so we're

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,720
absolutely thrilled to have you back

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
again um i'm i'm excited about your talk

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
uh you're gonna talk about

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,520
many different things but one thing that

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,119
was kind of standing out in my mind is

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,960
you have a slide on cognitive

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
functions in here and that's always a

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,439
big thing for me especially

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
in the midst of the pandemic especially

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,520
if you just look back just over 13

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
months if you go solar winds to log 4j

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
just everything has happened to our

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
community in that time it's been really

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,159
tough so becca please take it away super

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,560
excited

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,399
thank you so much

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,520
um yes frias and puppies is one of my

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
favorite uh i think axioms that i got to

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,119
bring in and it was my first cti summit

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,119
presentation

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
and let me make sure i can click through

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,560
here

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
awesome so i am so happy uh to be here

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
today and thank you so much for the

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,759
introduction

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,520
i've said it before and i'll probably

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
say it many more times

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
this is one of my favorite events of the

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,318
year

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
it's where i have met many of the people

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,480
i call my dearest friends including rick

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,480
i believe we met at the 2014 cti summit

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,239
katie as well we met at 2018 2016 i met

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,160
scott roberts and it's one of the places

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
where we started working on our book

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
intelligence driven incident response

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
um and it's also where i come to

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
remember that no longer no matter how

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,599
long i've been in this field

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
and it's 20 years this year which seems

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,599
like a really long time

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
i always have more to learn

74
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
so this morning i want to talk a little

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
bit about some of the core elements of

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
threat intelligence work

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,640
throughout the summit you're going to

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
hear a lot of case studies presentations

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
even some workshops that talk about how

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
much variety there is in the cti field

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,599
you could be supporting a sock response

82
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,360
to a ransomware event

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
or analyzing a nation's past 15-year

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,319
history of network operations prior to

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,400
kinetic warfare without ever leaving the

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
field of cti

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,879
but what's amazing in this work and one

88
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,200
of the things that i have spent

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
the past few years kind of really

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
digging into are what are the elements

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,959
that underlie

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,840
all of these types of operations

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
and that kind of bring us together and

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,599
make us one field and help us learn and

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,560
grow from each other

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
and what i've come down to

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,440
is that we're all tied together all

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,799
these different varieties within our

99
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,560
field are tied together by the stories

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
we tell the systems we build

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
and how well we know ourselves and how

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
well we know our teams

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,319
hopefully you'll see some of your own

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
cti journey and some of the things i

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,360
cover this morning

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
or maybe you'll see something you want

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
to implement or something you can tie

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,159
into the amazing talks that we have

109
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,679
lined up for you throughout the summit

110
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,360
so the data we use in cti is often

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
pretty technical um and it isn't always

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,599
accessible or understandable by all the

113
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
people who need to understand it and

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
with the way that we use technology

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
everyone really does need to understand

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,160
it everyone um has potential risks or

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
threats that they're exposed to just by

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,880
how much our lives are online especially

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,440
so during the past two years

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,199
so cyber threat intelligence provides an

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,120
opportunity to take these technical

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
details and build a picture of the

123
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
threat

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
regardless of the name or the face or

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
the logo

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
every intrusion attempt every

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,960
spearfishing email has a story to tell

128
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,120
and one of the first stories that cyber

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
threat intelligence told was the

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
cuckoo's egg by cliff stoll

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
and if you joined us early and you got

132
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
to hear some of rick's fun trivia around

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,759
the cti summit um cliff actually

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,639
keynoted the 2017 cti summit which is

135
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,800
where we got this quote

136
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,199
in addition uh the book the cuckoo's egg

137
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,560
and you know i'm realizing we do have a

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
lot of new folks so for quick synopsis

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,000
if you haven't read it

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
first of all absolutely please read this

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
book um if you're new to this field it

142
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
can be life changing but the summary is

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
there were hackers breaking into

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
government and military networks in the

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
1980s

146
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,440
and this activity was identified by a

147
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
systems administrator who picked up on a

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,199
billing error in the system um you know

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,720
you had to pay for the time that you

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,080
were using the computer systems and

151
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,919
somebody wasn't paying

152
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,440
so of course uh that began uh cliff down

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
a journey which he calls to track a

154
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
wiley hacker

155
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,199
where he ended up connecting printers to

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
the phone lines sleeping on a basement

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
writing down tons and tons of

158
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,199
information in a notebook until he could

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
build a story and build a picture of

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
what was going on on this network

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,919
but that was only the beginning of his

162
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,919
story because once he found out what was

163
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,840
going on he actually had to convince

164
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
people that it was important and that

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
they needed to do something about it

166
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,319
and that is where this quote came from i

167
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,840
thought all i had to do was show people

168
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
the data and they would understand but

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,120
it doesn't work you have to tell a story

170
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,199
the cuckoo's egg also has a special

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
meaning to me personally

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
i started my career in cyber threat

173
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,639
intelligence as a marine

174
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
i had done about eight years as a

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
traditional um intelligence analyst

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
focusing on national security and

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,560
counterintelligence um and when you're

178
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
in the military and if i have any active

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
duty or any veterans and here you

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
understand this you don't always have a

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,479
choice with what your next duty

182
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,319
assignment is or your next job is even

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,600
if you think you're really good at the

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
thing you're doing now that doesn't

185
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
always matter as much as one might hope

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,199
and so i was given an assignment to our

187
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,080
new

188
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
cyber unit as an intelligence analyst um

189
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,440
and they tried to assure me that

190
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,880
you know i was gonna be fine it was

191
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
gonna be great it was the same things i

192
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,199
was doing intelligence analysis um just

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,840
with computers uh but i was really not

194
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
excited because it i didn't think that

195
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,400
it would capture my interest and it

196
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
wouldn't let me um allowed you know

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
solve the complex puzzles uh that i

198
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,960
loved in the work i was doing

199
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,599
but luckily uh we have a i don't know if

200
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
people know this marines are voracious

201
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,479
readers so we had a book assigned to us

202
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,680
each month

203
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
and at the beginning of my my new unit's

204
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,440
tenure

205
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,880
we were assigned to read a cuckoo's egg

206
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
and that completely changed my viewpoint

207
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
on not just the job but what i could

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
bring to the table

209
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
i understood not just that there were

210
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,720
absolutely puzzles that we could put

211
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
together

212
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
and new puzzles that not everybody knew

213
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,880
what they look like and how to shape

214
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,800
them but that i could also bring my

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,440
communication skills and my storytelling

216
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
ability to help people understand what

217
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,840
was going on

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,720
um so again i uh master gunnery sergeant

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
givens um dr gibbons now i believe it

220
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
was our senior enlisted at the time and

221
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
he was the one who told us to read the

222
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,879
book so if you're ever listening to this

223
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,000
thank you

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
that set me on a trajectory that brought

225
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,199
me here uh keynoting on the same virtual

226
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,479
stage that clistol once stood on

227
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
as analysts we have this sort of

228
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,639
superpower of looking at things like log

229
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,199
files and intuitively seeing uh the path

230
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,960
our adversaries took and what they are

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,759
after

232
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,160
but what's important to note is that

233
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
this superpower is unique to us

234
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,120
it is not intuitive to everyone else so

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
our job isn't just to show someone the

236
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
log files uh our job is to bring our

237
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
insight and connect it to others via

238
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,799
story

239
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,120
so story is so important to cti um i

240
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,839
think so cliff thinks so master gunnery

241
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,559
sergeant givens thinks so um and so it's

242
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,080
important to know how we can leverage

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,760
this in the critical work that we do

244
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
i'm also a big fan of brene brown and i

245
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
love her podcast dare to lead she starts

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
each interview with um she has some

247
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
really really great key influential

248
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
folks on there but she always starts off

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
by asking them to tell their story

250
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
and this isn't just an exercise in

251
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
vanity letting someone talk about

252
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,640
themselves

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
usually they start way back in childhood

254
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,640
and that is usually not a flattering

255
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
place to begin one story

256
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
but the reason this story is so

257
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
important because it gives the listeners

258
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
context into their lives and how they

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
approach the world

260
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,959
and it sets the stage to receive the

261
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,240
information that they're going to be

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,120
passing on via this podcast

263
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
story serves as a connective tissue

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,399
between people

265
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
it connects the person telling the story

266
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
with the audience it connects what

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,680
happened in the past with what's

268
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,959
happening now

269
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,720
and it connects what's happening now to

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
what we think may happen in the future

271
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,839
since the one telling the story is

272
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
typically the one talking especially if

273
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
it's a written format you're kind of

274
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,880
just conveying information to people

275
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,200
establishing that connective tissue is

276
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,959
really really important

277
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,880
there's a quote i love

278
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
and it is there are two ways

279
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
to share information you can push it out

280
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
or you can pull people in with story

281
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,880
for what we do and especially with as

282
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
high stakes and as complicated as some

283
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,640
of the things we're trying to pass on

284
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,680
are

285
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
we will be far more effective if we can

286
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
set

287
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,120
that stage and make that connection so

288
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,440
people listen if we can convey why does

289
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
this matter to the person who's reading

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,240
it

291
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
um

292
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
then we can actually get them to pay

293
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
attention and to draw their own insights

294
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
another thing that i love about story is

295
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,760
connective tissue is that when we

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
collaborate in our field

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
sometimes it can be something like

298
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,680
a reading a report or giving a brief um

299
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
but often it turns into a conversation

300
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
and that's why i love things like our

301
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,959
slack channels that we have for this

302
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,920
summit

303
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
is it turns just one person telling

304
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
their story from their perspective

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
into more of that game um that you know

306
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,519
you might have played it as a kid but uh

307
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
each person goes around and one person

308
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,279
starts with a sentence and someone adds

309
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,440
on and someone adds on and you end up

310
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
telling this story that is completely

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
different than maybe the person who

312
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,959
started it thought it was going to be

313
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,880
but by adding everyone's perspectives

314
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
and allowing them to tie in and see how

315
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,880
it relates to their piece you can

316
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,240
actually come out

317
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
with a far more better more cohesive

318
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,399
story than if you tried to do it alone

319
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,760
however

320
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
with great power comes great

321
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
responsibility

322
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,680
uh truth is critical to the work that we

323
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,959
do

324
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,279
and it's also really really hard to land

325
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,720
on

326
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
often when we are

327
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,600
sharing insights or or displaying

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
something in a story format to someone

329
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,399
it's not just based on facts we're not

330
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,800
just showing someone the log files

331
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,839
um we're sharing our insights and our

332
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,120
judgment and this should really be based

333
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
on our best judgment

334
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
when we have people's attention it's

335
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,760
easy to try and

336
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,240
learn what is going to make them tick

337
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
and what can we say how can we phrase

338
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
something in a way that is going to get

339
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
them to act and when we do that it is

340
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
really important that that information

341
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,040
be truthful and accurate

342
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
um there's no place in our field for

343
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
intentionally misrepresenting or

344
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
misinterpreting facts to push an agenda

345
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,320
no matter how honorable that agenda is

346
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
if we put information out into the world

347
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
that isn't accurate and that we know

348
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
isn't accurate

349
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,920
and people start leveraging that and

350
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,519
pulling it into their own story and

351
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
pulling it into their own insights we

352
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,600
don't know what side effects that might

353
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
invoke and so

354
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,480
it is really important to have integrity

355
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,399
in the stories that we tell we're not

356
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,839
fiction writers

357
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,920
at least not in this job i actually know

358
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,079
a lot of really great cti analysts who

359
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,839
write some good science fiction

360
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
but they keep those works separate

361
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,920
now that doesn't mean that we're always

362
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,360
going to get everything right all the

363
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
way um all the time

364
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
right away

365
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,480
um

366
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
there is

367
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
a lot of the work that we do is based

368
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
off of incomplete information and

369
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
there's uncertainty and on top of that

370
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
we're often working against an adversary

371
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
who is intentionally trying to make sure

372
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,720
we don't have the full picture

373
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
so we do have to do

374
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
share and analyze to the best of our

375
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,839
ability

376
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,360
but we should always be on the lookout

377
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
for new information being introduced

378
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
that might change that narrative or

379
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
might change how we recommend someone

380
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,200
acts and when we get that new

381
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,240
information or when we uncover a mistake

382
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
um

383
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
that we find you know maybe we

384
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
misanalyzed or misinterpreted a piece of

385
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,279
data previously it's really important to

386
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,839
correct that mistake again we're

387
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,760
building a body of knowledge we are

388
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
putting things out for other people to

389
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,639
use in ways that we may not anticipate

390
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,480
and having accurate information out

391
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
there

392
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
is very important

393
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
and it's also a sign of courage in the

394
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,680
field

395
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,079
if you say something wrong

396
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,320
honestly make a mistake and you go back

397
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,560
out and say you know what

398
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,639
we have new information this is actually

399
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,000
the case or this is actually what we

400
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
recommend

401
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
that shouldn't be viewed as a mistake

402
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
that should be viewed as learning

403
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
and there is no cti field without

404
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,440
learning

405
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
so not only do we as individuals

406
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
need to feel comfortable with our

407
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
analytic capabilities to come out and

408
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,560
say when we have changed our our

409
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,360
assessment um but as leaders we need to

410
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
encourage that and the people who are

411
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,399
working for us

412
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,560
and as spectators

413
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
even on twitter

414
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,240
it's important to know that people

415
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
correcting information or updating an

416
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,079
assessment

417
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:48,959
is

418
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,279
probably one of the bravest and most

419
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,720
useful parts of our field

420
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
so we don't get to good accurate stories

421
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,399
by accident

422
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
um

423
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,920
excuse me i forgot i had a slide in here

424
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,959
so the last aspect of stories

425
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,920
is that they drive action uh so unlike

426
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,440
like i mentioned some of the folks out

427
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,120
there who uh write fiction novels um

428
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,839
or other types of of work this isn't

429
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
meant to be light reading for someone at

430
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,199
the end of a hard day

431
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
we're conveying information that someone

432
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
needs to act on

433
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,160
this can be through direct

434
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,360
recommendations if we think we have a

435
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
good idea of what needs to be done in

436
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
response to the adversary that we're

437
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
talking about we can provide those

438
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,399
directly but it can also be through uh

439
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,639
changing people's perspectives helping

440
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,759
them understand more about the nature of

441
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,160
um an activity or an adversary that they

442
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,240
might not have known before

443
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
changing perspectives is especially

444
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,079
important when we're dealing with fields

445
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,399
where we're not experts in ourselves

446
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
and we might not know the best course of

447
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
action but we can provide information to

448
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,639
people who do

449
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,199
one example of this is a work that i've

450
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,040
done in the past on the wastewater

451
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,720
system

452
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
i have

453
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,399
some experience with water and

454
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
wastewater

455
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,199
i talk about my mom a lot she is a

456
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
wonderful human being she has a phd in

457
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
wastewater

458
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
um and so she will frequently come to me

459
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,519
and ask me like cyber security questions

460
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,800
or i read about this attack or what

461
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,079
should i do

462
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,079
and i can tell her about the attack but

463
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,240
i can't tell her what that necessarily

464
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,519
means to her you know bio-organic system

465
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,959
that's growing bugs that eat

466
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,560
parasites out of water again i'm not

467
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,839
entirely sure what she does but it's

468
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,959
wonderful

469
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,399
so i need to be able to provide

470
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
information that she can use to say okay

471
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,079
i understand what this means for me

472
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,440
maybe i didn't think this was important

473
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
before but now it is

474
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
and we can only do that when we are

475
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
humble enough to know that we are not

476
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,399
experts in everything

477
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,320
but we can also use story to build

478
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
knowledge

479
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
and again this is why it is so important

480
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,919
that that knowledge is accurate and that

481
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,480
we update it when situations change

482
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,119
because i might put a report out on an

483
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,199
adversary activity that i see that maybe

484
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,280
no one else is seeing right now but by

485
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
having that accessible and searchable

486
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,439
and accurate and up to date hopefully

487
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,359
with a date on it as to when i put that

488
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,280
information out there

489
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,439
maybe when rick or katie come across

490
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,799
that information

491
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,880
they can take what i've learned build it

492
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,679
into theirs and continue to grow

493
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
the canon in our field

494
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,000
so regardless of whether there is a

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,240
specific actionable

496
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,559
item that you want to tell someone to do

497
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,160
it's important to remember that the

498
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,919
stories we write we don't write them for

499
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,880
ourselves we write them for other people

500
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
and we want it to be in a way that they

501
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,120
can use it

502
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,679
so how do we get to the point where we

503
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,520
are writing

504
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,000
or telling or sharing

505
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
stories that are helping people make the

506
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
right decision about things

507
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
it isn't by accident

508
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
it comes from the second core element of

509
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,760
cyber threat intelligence which is

510
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
systems

511
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
um and i'm not talking here about

512
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
computer systems or a system that we

513
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,679
built to automate to do something

514
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,160
although maybe that ends up being um the

515
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
solution but the systems here i'm

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
talking about can also be known as

517
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,240
processes uh it's a set of principles or

518
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
procedures according to which something

519
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,280
is done

520
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
it can be an organized framework or a

521
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
method

522
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,960
i am a systems thinker i view things in

523
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,799
connections

524
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,600
understanding how one action might

525
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,640
impact other actions um i love systems

526
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
analysis if you've taken forensics 578

527
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
and seen the systems analysis slides

528
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
those were ones i insisted on sticking

529
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
in there just because it's so important

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
to me personally um but it makes sense

531
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,080
to me that i also love systems in

532
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,480
general

533
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,039
so we have some great framework and

534
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,600
methods in cti already things like the

535
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
diamond model uh cyber kill chain uh the

536
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
attack framework but how and when we use

537
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,440
these tools or what truly makes up our

538
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,880
systems

539
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
uh james clear has an amazing book

540
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,280
called atomic habits where he touches on

541
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,919
the key components of systems

542
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,760
which i think is sometimes in direct

543
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
contradiction to the way we like to do

544
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,160
things primarily in incident response

545
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
and in cyber threat intelligence

546
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
he talks about the importance of

547
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
building these systems

548
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,720
in a way that we can

549
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,559
work on them in an

550
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,679
iterative manner um that we can day by

551
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,720
day by day go through this process then

552
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
become better and smarter and more

553
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,760
efficient at them um and because of that

554
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,840
it really is the consistency of the

555
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
systems and not the intensity that

556
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,400
matters

557
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
james even goes on to say that our

558
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
systems are the most important factor

559
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
and whether a person is successful in

560
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,159
achieving their goals

561
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,520
one example of this is the olympics so

562
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
everyone who is participating in an

563
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,760
event at the olympics has the goal of

564
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
winning the olympics but not everybody

565
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
can actually win the goal or can win the

566
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,440
win the gold medal just having the goal

567
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,039
doesn't necessarily mean that you're

568
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,520
going to be successful

569
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
what actually makes people successful

570
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
what makes them win

571
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
are the systems they build their

572
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,480
practice uh their training regime

573
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,840
um the habits that they've been

574
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
developing over years their coaching

575
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
systems

576
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
the best process is for self-reflection

577
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
and improvement

578
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,080
all of those done consistently

579
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
will provide far more success than

580
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,640
somebody who just sets the goal and says

581
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
i'm going to win the olympics

582
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
so for us in cti this adds an extra

583
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,799
layer of complexity

584
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,799
because first we have adversaries who

585
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
are working against us they have goals

586
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,200
that are typically the exact opposite of

587
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,039
our goals

588
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,799
and in addition we rarely have static

589
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,120
goals and sometimes the goals we set are

590
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,840
not even completely achievable goals

591
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,919
we can't win the internet

592
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,240
we can't prevent all attacks from

593
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,720
happening 100 of the time

594
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
so instead of being goal-driven we

595
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,559
should strive to be systems driven

596
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,320
so how do you build a good system

597
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,280
well that depends um as we know that is

598
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
the standard answer and you're going to

599
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
hear it so many times throughout this

600
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
summit and i'm actually pretty impressed

601
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,240
that i made it like 15 minutes without

602
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
saying it

603
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
um but

604
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
best systems for the task will be based

605
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,520
on a lot of different factors

606
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
but luckily there is a system for

607
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
building systems

608
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,960
the first part is framing the problem

609
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
and then you use that to leverage

610
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,919
systems thinking and designs thinking

611
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,760
into developing requirements something i

612
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,360
know rick is very excited about um

613
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
but how so what exactly is systems

614
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,440
thinking and design thinking and how do

615
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
they connect the problem with the

616
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,360
solutions we eventually end up

617
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
implementing

618
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,120
systems thinking means we think of the

619
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,039
interconnected parts that are critical

620
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,120
to addressing the problem and to meeting

621
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
our requirements

622
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,559
if the problem is that your organization

623
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,320
can't keep up with all of the media

624
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,240
reporting on threats that exist and you

625
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,440
don't know what you might need to

626
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
respond to

627
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960
your system thinking will start

628
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
enumerating all of the very components

629
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
required and addressing that problem

630
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
you'll need news feeds you need a threat

631
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,919
model you need people to review those

632
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,760
feeds and the models

633
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,919
those people need the time and space

634
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,200
free from other fires to do the analysis

635
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
to update the threats to update your

636
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,039
models you need a mechanism to

637
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
disseminate the report to those who need

638
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,559
it you need to figure out who actually

639
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
needs to receive this information

640
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
design thinking is another area that's

641
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,320
incredibly useful to building systems

642
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
because designers focus on addressing

643
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
problems by building solutions and they

644
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,600
really get the design right the first

645
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,640
time

646
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,600
instead

647
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
they work on rapid prototypes that show

648
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
whether a specific design meets their

649
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
needs

650
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,960
if it doesn't they address the prototype

651
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,159
or they just go back to the drawing

652
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,640
board to the beginning

653
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,720
when we start to design a system to meet

654
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,799
a need we have to be careful not to get

655
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,919
stuck on the first idea we had

656
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,280
um

657
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,720
there was a tweet recently um from

658
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,960
christian another good friend of ours in

659
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,320
cti which was a blank spreadsheet that

660
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,360
said

661
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
threat intelligence categorization

662
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,640
framework

663
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,559
and a lot of times this is what happens

664
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
when we start our system thinking that

665
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,559
we know the answer already without going

666
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,480
through this process

667
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,320
and i felt a little called out because i

668
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
went back through my google drive and i

669
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,760
saw how many documents i've started that

670
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,039
had like grand titles like

671
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,320
ground truth and threat intelligence or

672
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
system for categorizing systems and then

673
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
just nothing in there

674
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
when we go in thinking we already know

675
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,039
the solution and we know what we need to

676
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,880
do and we skip going through this

677
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,600
process of framing the problem and using

678
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
systems and design thinking to build a

679
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
system that is going to address all of

680
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,080
our needs in a way that allows us to be

681
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
consistent

682
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
we're going to be stuck with just a

683
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,159
grand title and no data

684
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
so there's another aspect to just

685
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,960
building the system um that's going to

686
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,799
depend or

687
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,240
that is going to help us build the right

688
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,919
system

689
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,200
this is

690
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,440
the connection framework

691
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,159
which means habitat

692
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,960
and the reason is named that is because

693
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
a habitat campaign contains a lot of

694
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,159
different

695
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,000
types of actions that we need to respond

696
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,919
to a lot of different systems of

697
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,520
different natures that all interact with

698
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,799
each other

699
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,840
it is a truly complex environment

700
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,720
and

701
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,360
the the problems and the issues are

702
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,679
varying complexity but at the end of the

703
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,840
day they're all things we need to

704
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,120
address

705
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,360
it's been described as a sense-making

706
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,440
device rather than a categorization

707
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,720
model

708
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
because you can't always put things into

709
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
one particular bucket

710
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,360
but

711
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,799
it can allow you to understand to assess

712
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,880
the the problem that you're dealing with

713
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
to identify what type of system you

714
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,880
might need to build

715
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,799
um it's based off the concept of ordered

716
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,919
systems so you have uh ordered systems

717
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
disordered systems which are complex

718
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,640
systems and chaotic systems and ordered

719
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
systems are split into simple and

720
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,360
complicated

721
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,360
so simple systems or obvious systems

722
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,640
as sometimes people like to use

723
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
are problems that are well understood

724
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
and the solutions are evident there is a

725
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,000
very clear cause and effect model

726
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
when you have this type of situation you

727
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,559
can implement a well-known system

728
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,080
this is a place where a lot of our

729
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,200
industry best practices thrive

730
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,360
you can use something like the diamond

731
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,840
model consistently to address certain

732
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,600
types of problems or the kill chain is

733
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,840
another example when you know that an

734
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,039
intrusion has a series of steps you can

735
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,679
use a system to map them out

736
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
now the reason i prefer this to be

737
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,080
called an obvious framework rather than

738
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,679
a simple framework

739
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
um is when we view something as simple

740
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
it's it's actually easier to think that

741
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
we can cut corners or skip it entirely

742
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,799
and have the same outcome

743
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,120
what is important here with simple

744
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,440
systems is that even if they are not

745
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,400
complex they still require that

746
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
consistency that james clear talked

747
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,559
about

748
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,760
so an example of this is uh i mentioned

749
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
scott roberts he and i are

750
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
doing a second edition of intelligence

751
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
driven incident response and i'm very

752
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,600
excited about that we've been working on

753
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,840
it for a few months now and we have our

754
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
outline we know what sections we want to

755
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,960
add we know what things we want to

756
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
update what new models we want to bring

757
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,520
in

758
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,279
it is a well-known

759
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,120
um

760
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
a well-known system

761
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,960
and we can implement kind of the best

762
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,159
practices

763
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,720
um but telling myself that it's a simple

764
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,960
process does not make it any easier to

765
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
sit down every single day and actually

766
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,600
do the writing and do the work that is

767
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,440
going to make this an effective system

768
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
[Music]

769
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
so

770
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,039
when you're dealing with a situation

771
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,799
that you think is a simple situation

772
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,799
you need to build out not just the

773
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,520
system but build in the time

774
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,440
to build those habits and build that

775
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,799
consistency

776
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,559
and that's doubly true of systems that

777
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,679
you might think are simple

778
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
the next situation are complicated

779
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,120
situations

780
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,360
so again this is still an ordered system

781
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,520
there is cause and effect we generally

782
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
understand it

783
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,039
however this is the area where you start

784
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,399
getting into

785
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,279
not a clear best practice

786
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,320
but several good practices that would

787
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,960
probably all work in the situation and

788
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,159
so this is when you need to start

789
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,240
pulling in expertise

790
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,159
people can help identify and implement

791
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,520
which system is going to be best

792
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,440
subject matter experts are critical for

793
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,679
these complicated systems

794
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,360
another thing that's also really

795
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
important to remember with complicated

796
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,919
systems if you're a manager is that you

797
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,000
need to defer to the people who are the

798
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,320
experts in whatever the situation is

799
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,080
rather than trying to dictate what you

800
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,240
think is the best model

801
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,159
because in these situations your

802
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,960
perspectives might be different

803
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
and you might be dismissing someone

804
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
else's really really good idea and

805
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,960
asking them to implement it in a way

806
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,440
that makes sense to you rather than in a

807
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,399
way that

808
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,399
makes sense to them and it is equally

809
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
sufficient

810
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,240
so the difference between simple and

811
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
complicated systems is really best

812
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,799
practices first kicking the best out of

813
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,840
good practices

814
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,039
so complex systems i think this is the

815
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,799
area where a lot of us in cti thrive

816
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,279
most will find ourselves often facing

817
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,760
truly complex situations

818
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
so we may need to spend a great deal of

819
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
time framing the problem

820
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,000
uh prototyping through using that design

821
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,159
thinking to say okay is this working is

822
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,600
this not working

823
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,760
and with complex systems sometimes when

824
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,520
things aren't working the problem is not

825
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,200
actually with the system you're trying

826
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,360
to implement the problem might actually

827
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,520
be that you framed it incorrectly and

828
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,120
you have to go back to that problem

829
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,679
framing stage and restart to make sure

830
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,840
that you do understand all the facets

831
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,399
and all the aspects of this issue

832
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,720
so you can build a system

833
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,679
that is going to address it

834
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,440
this is the space where

835
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
a lot of our fields really really tough

836
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
problems exist

837
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,360
a lot of people find this to be the most

838
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
rewarding environment

839
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,200
but it can take a lot of time and it can

840
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,360
be quite mentally exhausting to spend

841
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,760
too much time only focusing on complex

842
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,279
problems

843
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,039
so the goal is not to spend all of your

844
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,000
time here as exciting as it can be to

845
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,760
dive into some of these really complex

846
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,879
problems and systems

847
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,039
so speaking of places we do not want to

848
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,799
spend a lot of time

849
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,440
uh chaotic systems when you're in a

850
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
chaotic space things have gotten out of

851
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,840
hand and you need to respond immediately

852
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
in many cases

853
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,000
and you don't always have time to go

854
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,200
through and gather all of the

855
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,279
information that you need to really

856
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,000
properly frame a problem and and iterate

857
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
through different types of systems the

858
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,640
way you would with a complex system

859
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,600
often when you enter the chaotic space

860
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,039
intentionally it is for innovation

861
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,200
but most often we enter it by accident

862
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,440
because of a crisis

863
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,840
chaotic chaotic situations highlight

864
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
gaps in our systems

865
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,760
um again if you're in there for

866
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,519
innovation you're highlighting a gap in

867
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,360
an error in opportunity you have to make

868
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,799
things better

869
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,360
but if it's a chaotic crisis

870
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,440
you missed something some

871
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,000
system some process somewhere that led

872
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,960
to this chaotic state so it's important

873
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
to get through this

874
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
but afterwards we need to make sure we

875
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,799
follow up and come up with a response

876
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,679
and really do a good after action to say

877
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,440
how did we get here

878
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,279
what could we have done better

879
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,120
did the way we address it actually

880
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
address it or do we need to go back and

881
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,679
continue to build a better system to fix

882
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,080
it for the future

883
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,919
so a lot of these spaces they don't stay

884
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,360
static

885
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,440
as we better understand and define

886
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,039
complex problems

887
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,279
and build systems that support them we

888
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,519
can actually start to move them

889
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,919
towards better understanding we can can

890
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,000
identify that cause and effect we can

891
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,159
know the impact an action will have on

892
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
one aspect of the system

893
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,640
and start to build good practices and

894
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,440
best practices around that

895
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,679
it's also important to note that chaotic

896
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,240
problems especially when they emerge as

897
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,840
a crisis

898
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,480
often have best practice solutions that

899
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
we just overlooked and didn't implement

900
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
previously

901
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,440
uh there is one more aspect to this

902
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,679
framework um and that is this space of

903
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,440
disorder here

904
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,919
disorder doesn't speak to the nature of

905
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,480
the situation itself but it speaks to a

906
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,279
miscategorization or a lack of

907
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,159
understanding of the true nature of a

908
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
system

909
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,799
this is also a problem we run into a lot

910
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,200
and we often err towards thinking

911
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,120
something is overly simple when it

912
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
really is complex

913
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
i think this every time somebody looks

914
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
at

915
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,159
uh a company that experienced a breach

916
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,679
or had an intrusion or is dealing with

917
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,840
some issue and says well this would this

918
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,960
would have been solved with best

919
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,159
practices

920
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,640
without understanding the full nature of

921
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,679
a complex problem when you over simplify

922
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,159
things you can also run the risk of

923
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,159
shifting yourself over into the chaotic

924
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,480
space

925
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,519
so

926
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,440
one of the big issues

927
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
with cti

928
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,519
and we're going to dive into this next

929
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,200
is that

930
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,159
the more problems that arise the more

931
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,240
especially complex or chaotic problems

932
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,760
that arise and this is an area where a

933
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,000
lot of us think we thrive

934
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,399
the more mentally taxing it is

935
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,440
and the more taxing something is

936
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,159
the more our analytic skills actually

937
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,679
decrease and we shift more towards uh

938
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,120
assumptions

939
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,760
and lean back at experience we give into

940
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,919
our biases we give in to the noise and

941
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,240
we can shift into that disordered state

942
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,559
where we're not accurately identifying

943
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,399
the true nature of an issue and of

944
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,600
course when you don't understand the

945
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,000
true nature you can't use any of these

946
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,039
systems

947
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,600
accurately

948
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,800
so the last thing we're going to talk

949
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,239
about today is our self

950
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,639
all intelligence analysis

951
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,040
requires humans

952
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
we have a lot of tools we've built a lot

953
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,879
of systems we've built to help augment

954
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,960
that but at the end of the day we truly

955
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
require human discernment to make

956
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,719
judgments about the situation pulling in

957
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,359
lots of different facts

958
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,879
but at the same time we're being

959
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,839
bombarded by other stimuli subliminal

960
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,199
information

961
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,800
and internal forces we know nothing

962
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,918
about

963
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,000
robert sapolsky wrote a really great

964
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,520
book called behave it's like 900 pages

965
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,599
of history and anthropology and

966
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,719
neurobiology so if you ever can't sleep

967
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,960
i definitely recommend it

968
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
but it really did shine a light on to

969
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,880
how much our minds and our thinking are

970
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,359
influenced not just by external forces

971
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,880
by internal forces as well

972
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,240
so

973
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,079
this is

974
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,839
this yellow part of the brain is the

975
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,160
anterior cingulate cortex it's not

976
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,920
completely understood no part of our

977
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,640
brain is completely understood

978
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,240
but we do know that it plays in a very

979
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
important role in cognition

980
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,520
including decision-making empathy

981
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,280
and parts of functional memory

982
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,480
especially where patterns come into play

983
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,720
now i'm not a neurobiologist

984
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,200
but i did read that 900 page book by

985
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,000
robert sapolsky and i also just finished

986
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
up a um

987
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,320
a series of courses on neuro leadership

988
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,040
which helped me understand how you can

989
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,200
leverage principles of neurobiology to

990
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,839
be a better leader

991
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,000
and i cannot read about types of brain

992
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,839
function without trying to apply it to

993
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,320
cti analysts who are some of the most

994
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,119
fascinating thinkers that i know

995
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,400
and one of the very interesting

996
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,320
hypotheses i have

997
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,359
that no one has so far let me test out

998
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,200
because no one will give me access to a

999
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,079
functional mri machine

1000
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,800
is trying to understand the difference

1001
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,280
or the association between people who

1002
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,599
are really really brilliant at pattern

1003
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,240
analysis at picking up anomalies and

1004
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
understanding small deviations and

1005
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,480
baselines like cliffstall

1006
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
picking up that eight cents billing

1007
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,560
error

1008
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,440
and

1009
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
people who

1010
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,839
have a really hard time

1011
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,280
dropping things

1012
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
or saying this is good enough i can let

1013
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
this go

1014
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,079
a lot of times the same super powers we

1015
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,160
have that allow us to pick up on a

1016
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,079
pattern and dig into it and identify

1017
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,240
something is wrong can actually work

1018
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,560
against us when it comes time for us to

1019
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,599
say

1020
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,400
i'm carrying too much cognitive load i'm

1021
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,320
not thinking clearly i'm going to let

1022
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,839
this problem rest and come back to it

1023
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,400
tomorrow

1024
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,440
and i think that that is one of the most

1025
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,359
important skills that we need to learn

1026
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,920
as cti analysts is where our own

1027
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,760
limitations are

1028
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,079
and where our skills actually start to

1029
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,079
work against us

1030
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,400
i love thinking about cognitive skills

1031
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,320
it's almost like playing cards

1032
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,000
if you're a leader and you're building a

1033
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,160
team um you know katie talked about

1034
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
encouraging diversity how we need so

1035
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
much diversity in this network

1036
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
is because the more diverse your

1037
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
organization the more diverse the

1038
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
cognitive skills you're bringing to the

1039
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
table are and you really do want to have

1040
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,720
people who

1041
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,040
have strengths in all of these different

1042
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
areas

1043
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,079
sustained attention

1044
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,839
inhibitory control

1045
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,920
processing speed

1046
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,640
cognitive flexibility is very important

1047
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,400
especially when we talked about

1048
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,240
storytelling and introducing new

1049
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,720
information and being able to

1050
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,480
quickly see

1051
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,320
how that new information can build into

1052
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,839
what you already know and being

1053
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,359
comfortable adapting cognitive

1054
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,599
flexibility is i think one of the skills

1055
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,920
that we need to foster more

1056
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,240
to allow us to really continue to grow

1057
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
and to be okay with the fact that we're

1058
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
always learning

1059
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,599
selective attention is also important

1060
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,079
because it allows us to dive into things

1061
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,760
when they're important

1062
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,280
but like i mentioned before about

1063
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,720
sometimes our

1064
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,400
tendency as analysts can never let

1065
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
things drop if you can move your

1066
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,480
attention to something else you can

1067
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
actually free up space in your brain to

1068
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,160
think more clearly about the problems at

1069
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,079
a future time

1070
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,040
working memory uh category formation i

1071
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
think we have a lot of folks with

1072
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,640
strengths in category formation

1073
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,079
every time we come up with a new

1074
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,800
framework or model i can really see

1075
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,560
those people with strengths and category

1076
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
formation just shining

1077
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,960
and then pattern recognition which is

1078
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,520
one of my strengths and again i

1079
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
definitely admit i am one of those

1080
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,760
people who cannot let things go

1081
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,440
especially when i know that it doesn't

1082
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,800
fit my expected pattern

1083
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,000
so a lot of people will have

1084
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,760
strengths on this list a lot of people

1085
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,839
will have areas where they need to

1086
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,960
improve or that they can grow things

1087
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,240
but what we also know about cognition is

1088
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,720
that across the board all of these

1089
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,800
skills get degraded when we're not able

1090
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
to give ourselves that proper care rest

1091
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,000
and support that we need

1092
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
sleep deprivation uh and sleep

1093
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,880
interruption even waking up frequently

1094
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,440
um both impact cognitive performance

1095
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,280
um so for example sleep deprivation uh

1096
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,640
impacts

1097
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,800
your working memory uh it impacts your

1098
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
cognitive flexibility in particular and

1099
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,800
i think maybe that's one of those one of

1100
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
the reasons that we do struggle and we

1101
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,640
get stuck and mired down in some of the

1102
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,960
biases when we've been working

1103
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
late nights on an intrusion or patching

1104
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
because of a vulnerability is truly

1105
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,040
because those skills that we need are

1106
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,599
degraded

1107
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,520
stress also matters

1108
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,839
it activates the amygdala which controls

1109
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,079
your body's fight or flight

1110
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,400
or freeze functions actually and it can

1111
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
hijack your cognitive functions

1112
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
and so this can severely impact things

1113
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,800
like pattern recognition and again

1114
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,880
cognitive flexibility because your mind

1115
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,560
is looking for the threats that your

1116
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,680
body is telling you are out there

1117
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
you're actually much more likely to

1118
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,560
attribute anomalies inaccurately to

1119
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,240
malicious activity when you're under

1120
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,560
stress because your body everything

1121
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,160
physiologically is telling you that

1122
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,760
there is a threat there and you're more

1123
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,000
likely to see that even if that's not

1124
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
the true nature of the issue

1125
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,119
cognitive load as well or how many

1126
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,040
complicated or complex mental tasks

1127
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,319
you're juggling

1128
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,119
impacts focus working memory and impulse

1129
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,520
control

1130
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,960
and again it's a double-edged sword

1131
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,720
because the more successful we are at

1132
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,280
our jobs the more consistent our systems

1133
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
the more connecting our stories

1134
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
the more impact it has on our cognitive

1135
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,160
load we're asked to do more we unearth

1136
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,839
more connections more things that we

1137
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,200
need to identify and categorize

1138
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,160
uh so the first time i read

1139
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,160
the cuckoo zing and again if you've read

1140
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
the book and sorry for spoilers if you

1141
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,359
haven't read the book

1142
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,520
um i skipped over he has all these

1143
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,040
little sections and tidbits where he

1144
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,119
talks about his interest in astronomy

1145
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,400
and cooking

1146
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
um and a lot of like hippie activities

1147
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,960
and i'm a hippie-leaning person myself

1148
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,160
and they were a little bit much even for

1149
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
me and i glazed over them

1150
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,520
as tangential or not relevant to what i

1151
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,280
really wanted to know about which was

1152
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,200
this amazing like whodunit hacker

1153
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,640
mystery

1154
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,960
but when i reread the book now i

1155
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
actually zero in

1156
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,400
on those sections

1157
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,160
and on those details i overlooked and

1158
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,599
thought didn't matter

1159
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,280
they may actually have been part of what

1160
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,359
enabled cliff to make those connections

1161
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,520
he did and to tell his story the way

1162
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,640
that he did

1163
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,839
he knew how to balance his stress and

1164
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,160
his cognitive load he knew even when

1165
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,079
he's sleeping on a basement floor so he

1166
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,160
can see when a printer comes up that

1167
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,920
there has to be a counterbalance and he

1168
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,640
has to do something to regain that state

1169
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,400
and keep his cognitive performance

1170
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,040
optimized

1171
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,400
so

1172
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,839
it's easy to say this rest sleep you

1173
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,839
know take care of yourself

1174
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,000
but if you can actually view this as

1175
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
part of your job requirement and

1176
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,839
managers and leaders if you can view

1177
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,040
this as a requirement for the folks

1178
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,560
who are working with you

1179
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,480
that if you want their cognitive

1180
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,599
performance to be best you want them to

1181
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,960
get answers sooner collaborate better

1182
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,440
and be thinking more clearly you need to

1183
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,720
build in time for their brains to get

1184
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,000
back

1185
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,240
to homeostasis don't keep them sleep

1186
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,480
deprived don't keep them under stress

1187
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,440
don't constantly toss the same complex

1188
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,359
problems on the same person just because

1189
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,760
they're good at it because

1190
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
without that balance

1191
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,280
it actually impacts our analytic

1192
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,720
capabilities and we won't be able to

1193
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,839
move forward as a field

1194
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,720
so if you're anything like me the past

1195
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,760
few years have been a bit draining

1196
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
the cognitive load i carry has been

1197
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,079
overwhelming at some times

1198
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,560
my systems are sporadic at best

1199
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,880
sometimes i have neither consistency nor

1200
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,920
intensity um and the stories can get a

1201
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,520
bit redundant as we feel like we're

1202
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,280
dealing with the same problems over and

1203
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,599
over

1204
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,240
but once again um that's why this is one

1205
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,079
of my favorite events of the year it

1206
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,359
recharges me even though it is

1207
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,760
almost 7 am now here on the west coast

1208
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,160
um and i should be practicing what i

1209
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,319
preach about sleep deprivation and sleep

1210
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,079
interruption

1211
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,640
but coming here and being around all

1212
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,400
these people all the creative thinkers

1213
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,160
and seeing what they're learning and how

1214
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,800
they're trying to approach not just cti

1215
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
in general but cti during a you know

1216
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,319
chaotic two years where we've had a

1217
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,560
pandemic and and just all sorts of crazy

1218
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,000
things going on

1219
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,480
it reminds me that things are hard but

1220
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,280
in cti we can do hard things

1221
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,440
we're not set on a fixed path we're

1222
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,040
creating our own future by coming

1223
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,440
together and sharing our stories seeing

1224
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,040
how others have built practices that

1225
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,880
support their work and more than

1226
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,640
anything else looking out for one

1227
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,640
another
