1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,559
i am so excited to introduce samara

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,000
um i told her while we were getting

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,840
ready for her talk and kind of

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
discussing the topic that i i really

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,839
wish i had seen this talk four years ago

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,160
when i was setting up my own program

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,480
and i think it really connects nicely to

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
some of the the themes that we talked

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
about already um

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
you know the the talk previously about

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
connecting into m a and integrating with

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,679
sort of a non-traditional group so i

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,439
think samara is going to expand on that

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
and i'm really excited to hear what you

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,239
have to say so thanks amara

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,640

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,239
and threat intelligence right and that's

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,079
just it's a beautiful marriage between

25

the two um i work at cardinal health so

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,879

100k

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
assets and plenty of attack vectors

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
across pharmaceuticals medical devices

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,799
supply chains

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,840
so let's get into

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,799
it oh

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,040
okay a little bit about me so

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
i'll zoom through this but what i like

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,840
to tell people is that if you don't

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,439
appreciate my talk we can at least talk

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,880
about something else right we have

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
something in common so i'll start with

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,600
the top left i like to binge anything

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,079
and everything so

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,560
lately it's been netflix but mostly it's

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
like hulu things like that right i

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,479
played basketball in college for a

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,479
couple years but i ended up

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,880
finishing online so if anybody went to

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
those schools hit me up let's talk about

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
it i love meeting uh

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
alumni so i'm a huge kobe bryant fan i

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
play basketball in college right so

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,520
january 2020 was tough for me

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
on the bottom these are my puppers here

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,360
they're the cutest i also have three

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,639
kids but i don't like putting their

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
faces everywhere so and a wife but you

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,640
know she would kill me if i put her face

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,760
because it would be huge right in the

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,319
center of the slide i am also originally

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
from texas i live in ohio now so any

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
other ohioans out there hit me up let's

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,959
talk about it i always put the texas

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
flag on here though because when you're

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
very young the brainwashing to be proud

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,840
so here i am a product of that

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,080
so get into it

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
threat intelligence now to the top left

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
here is my sort of definition i give

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,840
people outside of our org right so

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,000
consumption of generation of information

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,319
an organization uses to understand the

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
threats targeting the organization you

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,160
disseminate that information and inspire

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,959
action to drive protection and defense i

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,319
know what you guys are thinking

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
especially seasoned folks out there

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
intelligence is not information i agree

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,599
with you but i hate to break it to you

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,280
the people outside of our org they see

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
it as information it is our job to show

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,080
them that it's intel intelligence

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
so this could be a refresher for some

88
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
people girs versus pir so i'm going to

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,879
zoom through a lot of this but

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,120
general intelligence requirements girs

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,080
are sort of general threats that we care

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,040
about

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
um across our industry

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
priority intelligence requirements sort

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
of hones in on your company and what is

96
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
important to you threats that might be

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
targeting your organization

98
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,640
so we'll talk more about that in a bit

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
the cti life cycle

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
so when i give examples here you'll be

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
able to identify sort of you know what

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,959
area of the life cycle you know i'm kind

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,680
of

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,400
referencing but very quickly direction

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
is

106
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
what are we what are we doing what are

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,640
we talking about who are we talking

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
about what what gir's or pirs are we

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
focusing on collection going around to

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,879
the right

111
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,120
is what are we collecting

112
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,360
how are we collecting it maybe it's deep

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,519
dark web maybe it's an oh sitting feed

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
maybe it's a commercial feed

115
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
processing how are we collecting it and

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
what are we doing with it are we using a

117
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
sim are we leveraging a tip are we you

118
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,080
know integrating with our store platform

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
analysis this is where we figure out why

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
what what do we what are we doing with

121
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
it right does it even have context

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,759
related to our organization um

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
aspects of minor attack things of that

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,040
nature are going to land in analysis

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
dissemination what are we how are we

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
delivering it what product are we using

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
is it a presentation is it's

128
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
um uh brief you know there's all kinds

129
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
of ways you can disseminate the

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,840
information and feedback um arguably one

131
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
of the more important aspects of the cci

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
lifecycle

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,040
we had to talk about that garrett he

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
talked about feedback it's incredibly

135
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
important if you don't know

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,040
what your customers want to hear about

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
right and you don't give that to them

138
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,639
they're not going to read your stuff i

139
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,840
actually have a pretty funny story about

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,000
that a company i used to work for you

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
know back in the day i'm not gonna name

142
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,240
names we we ran a test to see if anybody

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
was um reading our briefs so for the

144
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
month of december we didn't send any it

145
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,759
was like a weekly thing right so very

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,039
forced until

147
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,880
it wasn't my idea i promise

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,400
we stopped delivering those those um

149
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,199
briefs for an entire month and nobody

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,440
said anything until january 15th like

151
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,479
mid-january it was very telling

152
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,240
so that was a that was a huge learning

153
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
experience for me

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280
next up so the intel partnerships i'm

155
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
gonna mention i'm gonna i'm gonna

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
lightly touch on some of the traditional

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
partnerships which i believe these are

158
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
my opinion based on talking to other

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
intelligence organizations is security

160
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
operations incident response security

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
leadership i delineated security

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
leadership specifically because i'm

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,360
talking about

164
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,720
directors vps svps your cso

165
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
um red team

166
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
vulnerability management and fraud

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,039
prevention

168
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,520
this shouldn't surprise anybody but if

169
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
some of these traditional partnerships

170
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
aren't

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,479
you know partners you generally

172
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,560
partner with then let me know let's talk

173
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
about it

174
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,840
now less traditional partners uh

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,800
partners that my team partners with we

176
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
put a little bit more you know

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,479
emphasis on these and some of the more

178
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,759
traditional ones are threat modeling

179
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,319
executive leadership okay so that's like

180
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,880
depending on where your ciso is it's

181
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,240
unfortunately it's a lot a lot of the

182
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
times above this user

183
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
uh governance risk and compliance with

184
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,319
an emphasis on third party risk uh

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
business information security officers

186
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
which is besos

187
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
um devsecops slash absec

188
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
again kind of depends on how your

189
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
organization is structured and then

190
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
security architecture and engineering

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
so

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
really quick before we go into the

193
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,440
partnerships let's talk again another

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
refresher for a lot of people out there

195
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
uh but i

196
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,680
i encourage you all to look up the types

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
of intelligence if you don't know them

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
already so tactical when i talk about

199
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,599
tactical intelligence i'm talking about

200
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
ttps i'm talking about infrastructure

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,759
right and now i'm going to use that icon

202
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,280
there

203
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,919
operational we're talking about specific

204
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,960
attacks

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
or campaigns

206
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,599
targeting an organization that can

207
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
include intent

208
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
motivation

209
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
you know capability things of that

210
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,280
nature

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,120
strategic got the little chess piece

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,680
there uh that's gonna be more

213
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
sort of broad and threat landscape based

214
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
maybe

215
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
i don't like to say it's to go to less

216
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,759
technical partners but that is sort of

217
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,039
how it's

218
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,318
described for a lot of people

219
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,639
so running through the traditional

220
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
partnerships really quick

221
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,639
so i hope not to offend anybody but i'm

222
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,240
a squash security operations with

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
incident response a lot of companies do

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
that they're on the same team maybe it's

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,879
a rotational maybe there's more senior

226
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,199
people doing instant response but the

227
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
key word with these partners is context

228
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,520
right so when we talk about tactical

229
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,800
intelligence

230
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
tactics techniques procedures

231
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,720
um infrastructure we need to add

232
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,639
context to that otherwise it's just

233
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,800
information kind of like before

234
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
we can definitely make the these teams

235
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
lives easier by minimizing okay

236
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
i forgot to mention i'm gonna say a lot

237
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
of buzzwords in here and i'd love for

238
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,240
somebody to keep count i think it would

239
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
be kind of hilarious because it's

240
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,840
something i'm working on um so when we

241
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,879
talk about

242
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,840
um

243
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,879
minimizing alert fatigue okay security

244
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,120
operations incident response threat

245
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,560
intelligence can do that so arguably and

246
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,479
if you disagree with me please let me

247
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,320
know i think

248
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,679
a lot of threat intelligence going to

249
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,399
these teams can be automated right i

250
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,080
think we can do that i think we can make

251
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
it happen i personally really like the

252
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
intelligence we get from these teams so

253
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,120
i do like a nice mutual relationship

254
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
between a threat intelligence team and

255
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
their partner

256
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
four security leadership i have a lot of

257
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,839
strong opinions i have a lot of strong

258
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,360
opinions in general so i don't i'm not

259
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
going to say that the rest of it you're

260
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
just going to hear a lot of them so

261
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
security leadership i talked about this

262
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,519
being directors vps svps

263
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,040
you know csos

264
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,959
if you do not have

265
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,640
some sort of direct

266
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
contact with your cso okay

267
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,279
if you are a manager of an intelligence

268
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
team or a director of intelligence team

269
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
and you are not letting your

270
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
intelligence team

271
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
interact with the cso you are doing the

272
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,480
entire organization a disservice okay

273
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
threat intelligence

274
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
should be

275
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
assisting a cso without any thing lost

276
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
in translation to make actionable

277
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,320
uh decisions i'm sorry informed

278
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
decisions okay

279
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,800
we can also make our csos lives easier

280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,360
so i call this little this red star on

281
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
the side our red star remember

282
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
something y'all can take away

283
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,160
some good advice from kristin

284
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
appreciate it

285
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
so next continuing on with the uh

286
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,360
traditional partnerships

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
red team we got tactical intelligence

288
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,040
right there ttps infrastructure that

289
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,760
relationship there is it's just organic

290
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
right we we report on something we tell

291
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
them hey this is kind of hot and cool

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
something sexy and they're like yeah

293
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,839
let's do it your red team is always down

294
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,519
right always down

295
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
vulnerability management

296
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,519
i will try to be brief

297
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
on this because

298
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
this is sort of my bread and butter so

299
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
what threat operations is made of

300
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,880
my threat intelligence team um partners

301
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,240
directly with our vulnerability

302
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
management team

303
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
to not only make their lives easier but

304
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,600
to create a risk-focused environment

305
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,839
i i talked about cardinal health having

306
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,600
over 100k assets right well over that um

307
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
that can get kind of tough when when

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
vulnerabilities are released and you

309
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
know there's these zero days but then

310
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,360
you know you've got attackers that are

311
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
exploiting you know cpus from five years

312
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,800
ago so to stay on top of that we have a

313
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,839
custom

314
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,399
risk framework that we use

315
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,480
okay um this is all true it's super cool

316
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
too we use different aspects of threat

317
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
intelligence right collecting data on

318
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,959
the sophistication of the attack um

319
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,519
it is our vulnerability on the perimeter

320
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,959
how many assets

321
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,160
is it uh you know impacting um what are

322
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
the other ones

323
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
i'm missing them somebody out there so

324
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
there's somebody on my team out there

325
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
that can include them but essentially we

326
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,720
have a custom risk score

327
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,839
that is tied to a custom patching cycle

328
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,000
and i'll i'll be

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,279
talking about that a little further

330
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,800
throughout the environment throughout

331
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,839
the um

332
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,320
presentation as well fraud prevention

333
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
there's a ton of people out there who

334
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,720
are much smarter than i am on fraud

335
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
prevention so i'm talking as simple as

336
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,200
like social media monitoring brand

337
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
monitoring there's a lot that

338
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,160
intelligence can do in terms of

339
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,720
collecting that data to help our fraud

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
teams so

341
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,160
our red star remember create a

342
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,040
risk-focused environment i believe i

343
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
strongly believe that a threat

344
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
intelligence team is collecting all of

345
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
this context so we can better understand

346
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,880
what our

347
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
technical cybersecurity threat risk

348
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,959
whatever you want to call it truly is

349
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,079
threat modeling so we've transitioned to

350
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
what i believe to be the less

351
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
traditional uh through intelligence

352
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
partners

353
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,519
so

354
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
some teams have like dedicated threat

355
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
modeling teams it's super cool and a

356
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
little uncommon

357
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
other teams like app security

358
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
red teams you know threat intelligence

359
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
and response they have their own sort of

360
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,440
threat modeling within their function

361
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
and that's totally cool too but threat

362
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
intelligence should have direct

363
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,040
involvement

364
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
okay in threat modeling so we can from a

365
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
tactical perspective develop attack

366
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,320
chains based on exposure right so what

367
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
does that even mean from my perspective

368
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,360
that means vulnerability we know

369
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
everything about our internal soft and

370
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
squishy right we have our threat

371
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,920
intelligence team who knows everything

372
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
about what's going on external to our

373
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
environment when we put those two things

374
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,680
together leveraging something like mitre

375
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,560
attack

376
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,200
we can sort of build these attack chains

377
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
and identify where we have some gaps so

378
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
that brings me to the strategic aspect

379
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,320
we can track technological and process

380
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,160
gaps notice i talk about process gaps

381
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
maybe it's because i'm in healthcare but

382
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,639
there are many process and visibility

383
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,440
gaps that should be tracked

384
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,160
to identify some additional risk right

385
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,480
so our red star remember for this one is

386
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
see the adversary be the adversary it's

387
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
like a like a mantra right

388
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
if we know what the adversary is doing

389
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
we can be that adversary and we can

390
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
identify certain weaknesses throughout

391
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
our environment

392
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
so executive leadership this is

393
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,199
something i'm very proud of

394
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,600
not everyone has the luxury

395
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
but having that direct line to the ciso

396
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,839
having the csos report having a cso that

397
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,480
believes in threat intelligence these

398
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
these things can happen you can have a

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
relationship with your you know

400
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,000
executive leadership i

401
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
we have regular sort of um

402
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
we have agenda items within their oc

403
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,680
meetings it's awesome okay

404
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,120
so what we've done from a tactical

405
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
perspective is something called ocean

406
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
projects okay this is

407
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
relatively simple it's just hardest to

408
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,639
get it started right so what we did

409
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,279
is we talked with our ceo cio cto chief

410
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,600
legal officer you know chief human

411
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,279
resource officer chief diversity officer

412
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,760
whoever and we dug up as much as we

413
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,639
could off the internet on them we tried

414
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,839
to be as creepy as possible so it was a

415
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
lot of fun naturally you know we went to

416
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
you know their houses and took pictures

417
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
you know identified some things like hey

418
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
your your fence is open in the back

419
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
should probably do something about that

420
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
but in all seriousness it was

421
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,519
interesting it was interesting to

422
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,880
put all of that stuff into a

423
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,519
presentation and show them hey this is

424
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
what we know about you we got all of

425
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
this information for free

426
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,519
and on the deep the deep and dark web as

427
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,920
they know it you know you can get even

428
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,399
more damaging information for

429
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
pennies okay

430
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,360
so

431
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
their their reactions were actually much

432
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,920
better than expected um they they took

433
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,560
it

434
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,079
some did something with it others you

435
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,440
know kept posting their vacations and

436
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,120
stuff but what you know what can you do

437
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
so that leads me to internal targeted

438
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,040
phishing right now let me there's a

439
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
disclaimer here not everything on these

440
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,279
slides some of them are just smart being

441
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
you know a visionary of sorts but others

442
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,759
are you know actually on our roadmap

443
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,800
these are one of the things that are on

444
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,720
our roadmap working with security

445
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
operations

446
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,120
to do internal targeted phishing we have

447
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,519
all of like a lot of the data on them

448
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
that would make them click

449
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,279
on a phishing email for our cio we

450
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
actually found out what car he drives

451
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,320
the number

452
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
we

453
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
we crafted our own phishing email based

454
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,800
on like

455
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,279
him having a recall in his car or

456
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,800
something we actually found a true

457
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,079
recall um but you know kind of drafted

458
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,639
this website that was obviously not

459
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,320
where you can look at your recall and

460
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,279
he's like

461
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,120
i would totally click on this

462
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,959
right he was super honest about it and i

463
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
love it but

464
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,279
there's

465
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,079
there's

466
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,440
there's benefit in that right getting

467
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
their eyes open to something like that

468
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,759
so it's part of strategy metrics on

469
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,199
attack chains

470
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,079
tech trends excuse me um dashboards on

471
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,800
compliance risk exposure we talked about

472
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
threat modeling if we can identify some

473
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,720
of those risks put it in a nice pretty

474
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
dashboard with all these cool colors you

475
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,360
know they love it eat that stuff up so

476
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
our red star remember is make your

477
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,560
executives

478
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
feel cyber smart now if there's

479
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,000
executives out there please

480
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
don't be offended but your executives

481
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,519
need to feel it right that doesn't

482
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,279
necessarily mean that they are but they

483
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,639
should feel they should feel more

484
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,120
confident before you about identifying

485
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,480
fishes right being able to um

486
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,360
sort of

487
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
prevent or not prevent but identify um

488
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,560
and ignore social engineering things of

489
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
that nature

490
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,520
governance risk and compliance i think

491
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,679
people sleep they sleep on this area

492
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,000
quite a bit i think it's super cool so i

493
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
talked about

494
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,599
vulnerability management having a custom

495
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,319
sort of risk model and i talked about um

496
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,679
having that custom patching cycle so

497
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
the only way well i'm not gonna say the

498
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,079
only way but the best way in some cases

499
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,559
is to get that in some sort of policy

500
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,280
right so arthur intelligence team

501
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,520
influenced policy creation we prioritize

502
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
an update and our patch management

503
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,400
policy

504
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,720
to say hey if your threat intelligence

505
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,679
team

506
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,480
says

507
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
this is bad

508
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
related to vulnerability management

509
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
and it's affecting your asset

510
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,120
you need to comply with this patching

511
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
cycle i was like left that's a win you

512
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
know it's nice to have that sort of fall

513
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,679
back on when people are whining and i

514
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
don't want to punch it well you you need

515
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,000
to because of x right it's nice to have

516
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,039
that so

517
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,600
new definitions of compliance we bumped

518
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
up that patching cycle based on

519
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,120
that trending vulnerability as well as

520
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
tracking the risk we talked about from a

521
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
threat modeling perspective and we'll

522
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,919
continue to talk more about this um so

523
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,919
our red star remember for this one

524
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,480
honesty is the best policy i know that's

525
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,520
not super original but it's true right

526
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
going on to third party risk i did

527
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
include customer risk here um again

528
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,960
maybe it's because i'm in healthcare but

529
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,160
this is an area that is often overlooked

530
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,840
right having an assessment for a vendor

531
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,039
isn't enough you need more okay so from

532
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
a tactical perspective threat

533
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
intelligence the information that we

534
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
collect you know leveraging things like

535
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,480
mitre attack and some other risk

536
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,679
frameworks we can be consulted we can we

537
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
can consult on creating and updating

538
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,559
third party assessments now it's enough

539
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,760
that's nothing

540
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,240
there's no phenomenon you know included

541
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,120
in that but on a quarterly basis

542
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,960
based on what we're seeing the threat

543
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
landscape right this is a great inn

544
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,039
right with your third party risk team

545
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,799
hey you know let us

546
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,799
it's no biggie there's no

547
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,360
you know action on their part outside of

548
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
sending you the assessment so you can go

549
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,440
through it and provide recommendations

550
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,039
that's generally what we do in general

551
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
we can't change their assessment there's

552
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
no harm in that which could lead to

553
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
these next ones here so from an

554
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
operational perspective assessing

555
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,720
exposure of third parties under contract

556
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
there are

557
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,880
tools out there that can help you see

558
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
the uh if there's some soft and squishy

559
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
on the outside of these third parties

560
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
and you could see how long

561
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
how long it takes them to fix it right

562
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
sometimes it's a good sign

563
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,520
sometimes in healthcare specifically i

564
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,480
don't talk about healthcare but that's

565
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,640
what i'm working in i worked at another

566
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
company as well healthcare it's an

567
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,799
interesting beast but

568
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,240
if there is a vendor

569
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,600
who is offering

570
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
a product they are the only vendor that

571
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
offers said product doesn't matter how

572
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,240
soft and squishy they are okay

573
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,400
they help your company is probably going

574
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,799
to invest in it but right it might it

575
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,120
might frustrate you whatever that's

576
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
business roll with the punches it's

577
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,919
still important to understand the risk

578
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
associated with partnering with that

579
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,520
that vendor

580
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
lastly from a strategic perspective

581
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,960
monitoring and the analysis of

582
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,559
third-party compromises

583
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,640
now it's very important to have some

584
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
sort of centralized

585
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,039
database where you have all of your

586
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,919
third-party you know

587
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,760
companies or people you do business with

588
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
or customers whatever so that you could

589
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,320
say oh okay let me look at this i see

590
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
these you know compromises happening

591
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,919
through whatever source

592
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,320
maybe some keyword alerts um sometimes

593
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
you have to

594
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,760
prioritize them you know based on b2b

595
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,640
connections or whatever right um and

596
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
track them that way unfortunately

597
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
sometimes it's all up in somebody's head

598
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,799
that's why the partnership is important

599
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,559
right for them to

600
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,960
unload that information so that we can

601
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
help them in some form or fashion

602
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,400
our red star remember is stranger danger

603
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
we should all be familiar with this as

604
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
children i still am it's very important

605
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,840
but before you do business with somebody

606
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
they're a stranger and you should treat

607
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
them that way

608
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
next

609
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
besos so i'll start with the red star

610
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
remember this is a movie quote so make

611
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
sure you uh you know comment if you know

612
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
it did we just become best friends

613
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,320
okay it's true besos

614
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,159
and threat intelligence can't they can

615
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,679
be best friends okay it's your channel

616
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
to the business you can get so much more

617
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,159
done if the business knows that you're

618
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,200
around

619
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,960
or is you know they know that you exist

620
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,799
i should say so

621
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,600
from a tactical perspective we have a

622
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
regional bissell so thanks billy

623
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
cardinal health they kind of jumped on

624
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,640
the biso train early and we have a

625
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
be so for every region of the world that

626
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,360
we work in we also have a b-scale for

627
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,039
the uh business units right so we have

628
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,960
one for corp medical

629
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,360
and pharma

630
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
regional user education is the first one

631
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
so we worked with a particular

632
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
in charge of the apac region um he was

633
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
awesome he loves threat intelligence

634
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
eats it all up and he reached out to us

635
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
and said can you help me identify

636
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
what's going on in this area of the

637
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
world they're like yeah give me 72 hours

638
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,600
and we have this product we delivered

639
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
the product now what were my

640
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,280
expectations out of that what were his

641
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
expectations he was expecting to get a

642
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
product

643
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,120
check

644
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,799
i was expecting him to read the product

645
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,039
and do what he thought was best for it

646
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,880
okay we should not get prideful as

647
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,720
intelligence analysts and say

648
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,360
do use my product i put this together

649
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
you should use everything in it no he

650
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,240
made it his own he created his own

651
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,880
document his own how to on how to

652
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
identify social engineering

653
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
in a phishing email how to report it to

654
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
use native language throughout it okay

655
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
these this is value that we're talking

656
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,919
about he leveraged the intelligence

657
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,200
information

658
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,760
to make it his own make it digestible

659
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
for the audience right that's a team

660
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
effort and it was awesome

661

at the business unit from an operational

662
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,080
perspective bec

663
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
right i want to say it was it was before

664
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
like everyone was talking about

665
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
ransomware for and when i mean everyone

bec was super big and we worked with our

669
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,280
corp

we're going to test you on it so pay

674
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,080
attention okay obviously there is more

675
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,440
involved with that but that partnership

676
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,400
right

677
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
business unit visos are huge champions

678
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
for change right because kind of have to

679
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,279
be they understand the intricacies of

680
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,840
the business and how that can impact the

681
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,760
organization as a whole

682
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,000
and from a strategic perspective

683
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
intelligence is being shared

684
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,720
bidirectionally i talked about having

685
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
that mutually beneficial relationship

686
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,520
the be so the intelligence team it

687
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
should be a marriage they should be in

688
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,919
love and going on vacations together and

689
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
you know uh getting their vows enrolled

690
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,720
every five years or so it should be

691
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
so much shared back and forth because

692
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,640
you can give them what you know about

693
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,279
emerging threats they can give you some

694
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,720
like heads up on what the business is

695
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
working on right because we seem to be

696
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,200
surprised by that often

697
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
next

698
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,080
devsecops i also include apsec because

699
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,919
sometimes they you know they run in the

700
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,799
same circles right this one

701
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,360
red star remember buzzwords coming shift

702
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,039
left

703
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
secure from the start

704
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,559
if there's other ones include them in

705
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
the hallway let's uh let's talk business

706
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
or buzzwords

707
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
so tactical perspective i'm going to

708
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
zoom through this one too because i am

709
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,679
not an expert but we do have a great

710
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,559
partnership um with our apsec team

711
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,559
and we talk about

712
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,799
introducing the threat models from our

713
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,960
perspective into the early stages of

714
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,039
testing there's also a mutual

715
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,279
relationship here because

716
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
you know we have a lot of

717
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
applications that are big old money

718
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
makers things that we've prioritized

719
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,640
ourselves um and

720
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,240
we can use the information from their

721
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
threat models in our own the ones i

722
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,760
talked about early on right so

723
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,120
it's important

724
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,559
even if so there are some okay let me

725
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,840
how am i going to say this there are

726
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
some teams that don't think they need

727
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,559
you

728
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,200
right so it's important

729
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,120
to sort of

730
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
you know not force your way in there i'm

731
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
saying force your way in there and and

732
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,760
show them how they need you right

733
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,600
develop that brief even if they don't

734
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,880
ask for it we're going to talk about

735
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
getting buy-in as well and i can

736
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,799
reference abstech dev setups um

737
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,039
prioritize at vulnerability so

738
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,559
you know vulnerability management we

739
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,240
obviously you know there was a huge you

740
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
know boner really that came out we're

741
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,679
still dealing with no big deal but you

742
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,559
know

743
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,320
from even from a container perspective

744
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,640
it's all very different right and i i

745
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,880
love it it's a it's a good challenge to

746
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
have but you know there's not really i

747
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,640
mean you could fix containers and all

748
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,080
that but generally it's a burn and

749
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,799
redeploy so are there processes that you

750
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,840
can implement with that team to say

751
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,559
you don't redeploy until you fixed and

752
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,120
stop it right these are the things you

753
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,360
know you unfortunately you're strong

754
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,919
army but they'll start to understand you

755
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,880
know the importance of it

756
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
lastly security architecture i'll try

757
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
not to spend how much i got 10 minutes

758
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,840
left or so

759
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,799
so we talked about minor attack

760
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,000
if you have a solid relationship with

761
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
your security architecture team you

762
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
should be talking to them on at least a

763
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,760
weekly basis if not daily in terms of

764
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,159
tracking control coverage

765
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,960
across tactics and techniques now minor

766
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,799
tag has already done a great job helping

767
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,039
us out with that okay but it's important

768
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
that these controls are configured

769
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,720
properly and that they are tested right

770
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,039
so it's it's all this happy you know

771
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,200
this party between uh security

772
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,480
architecture engineering threat

773
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
intelligence your red team or purple

774
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
team to test these things and actually

775
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
validate that they're working

776
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,720
defense and depth analysis so

777
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,559
well it's essentially the control

778
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,640
mapping with some added things right so

779
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
when i talk about defensive depth

780
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
i am also talking about

781
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,440
issues with or coverage related to

782
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
mitigation

783
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,279
those process gaps that i referred to

784
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,320
earlier but also gaps in visibility yeah

785
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
like i know we talk about you don't know

786
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,520
what you don't know but

787
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
seriously let's think about this okay

788
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,039
because there are things that we don't

789
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,080
have visibility into that are creating

790
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,640
incr like huge gaps okay

791
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,559
okay i'm not i'm getting excited now but

792
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,399
you understand what i'm saying defense

793
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,880
and depth analysis with control mapping

794
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,559
we should have a good idea of our risk

795
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,720
exposure we shouldn't be tracking this

796
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,039
in some sort of risk register with

797
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,679
digestible remediation plans that teams

798
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,919
can actually conquer right

799
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,360
leveraging our threat modeling team it's

800
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,000
all it's all a happy family okay talk a

801
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,840
lot about marriage and family that's my

802
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,919
thing so lastly from a strategic

803
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:14,960
perspective

804
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
consult on control acquisition so in a

805
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,760
perfect state right this is optimal we

806
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,880
know we know our control gaps we know

807
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,279
you know um where we have issues with

808
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,440
process we know where we lack visibility

809
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,360
at that point we should be able to say

810
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
is there a control out there

811
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,120
that we can acquire that will help us

812
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,080
with this

813
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,120
ideally right or maybe you make one

814
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
you know so our red star remember is

815
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
what does coverage mean to your

816
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,559
organization for us it means technical

817
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,279
controls mitigating controls

818
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,480
process

819
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,880
gaps visibility gaps

820
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
it's important to know what coverage

821
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,200
means to your organization

822
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,360
getting by and i had to throw memes in i

823
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
try not to meme you guys to death but

824
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,960
this is one of my favorite okay so

825
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,440
getting buy-in like i said before having

826
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,360
a supportive ciso can make getting

827
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,320
buy-in much easier obviously

828
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,720
so first one we got here a road show

829
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
explain who you are everyone does threat

830
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,240
intelligence differently so it's

831
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,000
important that you meet with your

832
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,919
potential stakeholders and you talk

833
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,880
through

834
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
what they can expect right

835
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,039
what does threat intelligence mean to

836
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,399
samara what does it mean to cardinal

837
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,320
health what does it mean to our

838
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,840
organization as a whole

839
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,240
for the first i want to say six months

840
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,760
of my job building the threat

841
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
intelligence team it was a road show it

842
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,440
was going out and talking to people

843
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
making yourself known

844
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,520
we talked about grrs and pirs

845
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
for each partnership

846
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
you should have pirs you should know

847
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
what is important to them so you can

848
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,600
reference them when you're going to

849
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,000
deliver a brief make sure you check in

850
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,679
that box okay

851
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,880
once more than check in the box you got

852
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,440
me though define goals and timelines so

853
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
i'm talking about having this ready

854
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,279
before you talk to them okay and i'm not

855
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,960
i'm also not saying that i had all of

856
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,039
this down right but there were some

857
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,880
repercussions that i learned in the

858
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,679
process of that road show to say hey you

859
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,440
know i probably should have said this is

860
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,279
what we plan to do and this is the

861
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,120
expected timeline so they don't come

862
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,600
knocking three months later like hey

863
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
but i've been waiting for this and

864
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,960
you're like oh well priorities have

865
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,559
changed nobody wants to hear that

866
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,799
they're not a priority

867
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,880
define stakeholder action it's very

868
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
important that you manage expectations

869
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,000
in terms of what you need from them

870
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,080
and then value proposition so

871
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,120
based on our goals based on stakeholder

872
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
action

873
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
why should they do any of it

874
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,320
we're all busy okay

875
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,080
tell tell them what value will come of

876
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,039
your

877
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,840
brief product whatever you're delivering

878
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,520
and what they should be getting from it

879
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
right sometimes it's obvious other times

880
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,399
they're like yo my day is full already i

881
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,240
don't need you adding to my workload so

882
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
the value proposition is probably most

883
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,679
important here outside of the goals and

884
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,679
timelines

885
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
lastly well this isn't the last slide

886
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,399
but lastly preventing a toxic

887
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,240
relationship i don't know if you guys

888
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,440
know

889
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,519
these people in the bottom right um it's

890
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,320
a very well known show on netflix but

891
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,720
they arguably have the most toxic

892
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,279
relationship that there is okay

893
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,760
how to prevent a toxic relationship

894
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,240
detailed scope so this is not only based

895
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,039
on the gir's pirs it's also based on

896
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,360
those goals and timelines so you could

897
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,080
say you know for the next 12 months

898
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,720
these are our goals for the next 90 days

899
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,279
this is a scope of our engagement right

900
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,080
and you deliver on that okay and then

901
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,000
you can extend it from there

902
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
continuous updating road map okay so

903
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,000
it's important well for me what i did

904
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,480
was had a certain are certain partners

905
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,679
sort of listed and then over over time i

906
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,360
showed which one would be like a

907
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
priority

908
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,360
in general right going across sort of

909
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
the calendar year or fiscal year

910
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
whichever you guys work with but it's

911
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,120
important to update this

912
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,960
continuously okay

913
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,039
and uh show okay we are ahead here we're

914
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,480
a little behind here

915
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
but you know i think we can make up time

916
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,480
here like it's important to keep those

917
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,960
lines of communication open right you

918
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,679
can

919
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,440
you can adjust based on the feedback

920
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,279
that you're getting adjust based on the

921
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,240
speed in which you're working um adjust

922
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,279
based on

923
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,799
you know ad hoc work that's coming in

924
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,120
this fourth one y'all okay

925
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,600
i really need you to listen and hear me

926
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,679
get the right people in front of the

927
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,799
customer

928
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,480
okay so

929
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
there are so many people that can work

930
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,760
in intelligence super crazy smart people

931
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,960
okay

932
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,679
not all of them should be interfacing

933
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,559
with

934
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,960
a particular customer okay

935
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,039
it's very important that we sort of

936
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,559
pay attention to the psychology and

937
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,240
different personality traits certain

938
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,919
people and maybe we don't put you know

939
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,120
two tauruses in the room together

940
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
whatever

941
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
feedback feedback feedback i've

942
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,679
mentioned this already

943
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,679
i'll mention it again a million times

944
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,039
make sure those lines of communication

945
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,960
are open and you're receiving feedback

946
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,799
this is the last slide so i'm coming up

947
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,200
on time i realize that in closing no

948
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,679
intelligence program is created equal

949
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
everyone does it differently

950
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,840
you decide what value you want to bring

951
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,559
to what partner and just do it and do it

952
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,679
well

953
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,960
partnership value is dependent on the

954
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
type of organization so like i said

955
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,039
we put a little bit more emphasis on

956
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,039
some of those strategic relationships as

957
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,279
opposed to the tech more technical sort

958
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,840
of indicator based relationships because

959
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
that is our gateway to the business

960
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,600
and providing value

961
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,399
throw these in your 135 your one year

962
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,320
three year five-year goals i'm not

963
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,240
saying go out there and do this now i'm

964
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,679
saying let's start thinking about it

965
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,760
let's put it on our strategic roadmap

966
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,640
last last last slide there's my twitter

967
