1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,839
uh hello folks how you all doing today

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,639
uh pleasure to join you happy today to

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
talk about warning

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,679
uh very quick obligatory caveats

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,600
everything i say today will be

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,320
uh entirely unclassified i'm speaking as

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,240
an academic from an apolitical and

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,560
vending mutual perspective um and these

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,119
views and opinions are expressed are

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,119
only my own and not

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,480
reflective of any part of the us

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,800
government

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,559
in terms of who

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,480
am i to be talking to about

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,559
the question of warning

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,719
i'm a former intelligence practitioner

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,440
that's become an academic along the way

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,840
and i was an industry

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
cti practitioner i was the first

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
intelligence hire and

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
the chief intelligence analyst at

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,879
eyesight partners i went on to become a

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,160
think tank type

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,920
my research primarily focuses on the

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
questions of decision advantage

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
in cyber intelligence and i work

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,199
essentially across a variety of

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,879
questions of offensive and counter-cyber

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,200
interactions i've also spent a good deal

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,479
of time working

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,920
with the office of director of national

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,200
intelligence

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
to explore warning tradecraft as part of

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,479
a tradecraft uplift for intelligence

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
education so um happy to talk through

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,720
some of the matters that we um serviced

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,159
there and talk through its application

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
in a variety of shops we've been in

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,119
why do we call warning the first purpose

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,640
of intelligence

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,119
or the core mission uh if you want to

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,680
use cia's terminology well it comes from

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,439
where the intelligence community as a

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,439
whole came to be

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,360
um we started

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
out of an intelligence failure

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
everyone is very well aware of the story

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,920
of pearl harbor i won't get into it but

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
at the end of the day it was a highly

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,320
technical specialty and discipline that

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
was staring at little bumps and

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
squiggles on a scope

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
that had to interpret

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
that last

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,600
mile question of adversary capability

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,079
and intention

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,399
the failure to do so

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,239
led to creation of the intelligence

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
community as we now understand it

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
intelligence as a professional activity

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
and the father of modern intelligence

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
sherman kent speaks of intelligence's

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
activities intelligence is product and

64
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,640
intelligence as organization

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
we tend to be really focused on

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,239
organizational logos we want to know

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,080
where they came from we want to know

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
who

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
wore what logo

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,959
and ultimately

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,959
it's more important here to focus on the

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
activity itself

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
the failure of warning at pearl harbor

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
also led to the first of the

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
intelligence after action reviews that

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
were ever conducted

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
a very smart lady by the name of roberto

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,200
woolstetter wrote a book called warning

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
and decision in which she unpacked a

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
variety of the pathologists in a variety

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
of the issues that led to

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
the lack of cohesion across the

83
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,760
community

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,200
she was the first to identify the

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,959
problem with signals versus noise the

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,800
idea that we are overwhelmed with the

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
volume of

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
velocity and variety of information

89
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,280
that

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,760
means we cannot as humans process all

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,280
these independent threads absolute

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,000
formal structures and processes to do so

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
she was the first to identify that

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,360
consumers could not be their own

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
analysts they could not be given raw

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
information and be expected to make

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,480
sense of these things

98
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
a lot of these principles became baked

99
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
into

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
our work over the decades

101
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,799
but at the end of the day

102
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
we are more than just the federal

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,799
intelligence company

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
we typically represent the national

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
intelligence community as a wheel of

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
agencies in some sort of structural

107
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,879
relationship

108
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,799
a lot of talks in the intelligence uh

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,720
world revolve around reorganizing and

110
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
restructuring these entities

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
that's not terribly helpful for those of

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
us in the cyber intelligence community

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
practice

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
we are all intelligence professionals we

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
all do intelligence as an activity

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,319
but we don't all come from

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,680
that core

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,239
center wheel and certainly we don't all

119
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,959
come as prior intelligence professions

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
there's a lot of folks that enter this

121
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,358
environment from very different skills

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,639
communities

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,479
engineers software developers reverse

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
malware analysts a whole series of folks

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
that simply did not have

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
that prior experience but we're all

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,320
doing this work

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,000
and ultimately we all came to do this

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,639
work and we've all had several very hard

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,440
years

131
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
many of our shops were established also

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
at major failure points

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
either because of the breach of an

134
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
organization or the

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
or the breach of an organization much

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,240
like ourselves

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
which convinced the decision maker of

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,800
the need to invest in an intelligence

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
capacity and capability

140
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,960
um and when i talk about warning

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
failures in this presentation i'm not

142
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
here to point fingers i was part of a

143
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
variety of these major cases we're going

144
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,039
to be discussing

145
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,520
i personally

146
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,759
exhibited many of the pathologies i'm

147
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,280
going to call out here

148
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,039
i'm not going to name names of other

149
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,800
folks in the shop if i'm pointing

150
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,320
something out you can assume it was my

151
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,479
failure my failures were however

152
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,039
reflected also more broadly

153
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,560
across the community

154
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
and i'm going to be talking only about

155
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
the industry side of this um at the

156
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
moment because that's predominantly

157
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
who's here and why we're here to talk

158
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
today

159
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
my colleague richard betts up at

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,400
columbia identifies

161
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
the enemies of intelligence a series of

162
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,320
issues that lead to what are essentially

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
what he calls the inevitability of

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
surprise

165
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
in

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,479
the space

167
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,759
unfortunately

168
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,199
um

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
we'll talk a little bit about who

170
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,120
opposes that viewpoint i really respect

171
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
the gentleman he has some incredible

172
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,720
ways of thinking and he identifies

173
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
failures of perspective

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,919
that is we don't see what we need to see

175
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,759
we don't understand what we are seeing

176
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,199
he talks about the pathologies of

177
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,000
communication even if we understand what

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
we are seeing properly

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
and uh we therefore we fail to

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
appropriately convey that uh he also

181
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,639
talks about the paradoxes of perception

182
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
the idea that

183
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
even though we see something

184
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
what we see may actually be changing and

185
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,280
what the act of our observation may

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,960
change the influence

187
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
may change or influence

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
those behaviors in the way that the

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
adversary changes

190
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
ultimately all these enemies

191
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,759
intelligence play out differently

192
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
between attack warning and other

193
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
operational evaluation tests they also

194
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
further change when you're looking at

195
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
forward defense planning tasks

196
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
so there's a serious difference between

197
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
what is happening in an imminent event

198
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
and what you're doing for longer term

199
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
countermeasures investments even though

200
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,919
you may be trying to issue warning

201
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
across the same cycle of adversary

202
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
activity

203
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,840
ultimately my colleague jason healy has

204
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,039
taken a lot of this work and broken down

205
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
the mechanisms of surprise that is the

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
adversary may do something through

207
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
different operational means than we were

208
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
expecting they may have different

209
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
technical means than we're expecting

210
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
they may change their timing change the

211
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
scale change trends in their operations

212
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,880
in ways that surprise us

213
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
and ultimately they may address a

214
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
different target than we're expecting

215
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
potentially for a different objective

216
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,160
this leads to a variety of different

217
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
types of surprise the most common of

218
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
course being pearl harbor the bolt from

219
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,919
the blue attack where we were not we

220
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
were at peace we were at a state of calm

221
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,759
and the adversary took an action we were

222
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
not expecting

223
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,160
um when my friend lynn torto stood up in

224
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,919
front of congress in 1991 and talked

225
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
about an electronic pearl harbor the

226
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,919
idea of a cyber bolt from the blue that

227
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,400
was a pretty novel concept

228
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,720
the utility of that analytic construct

229
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,000
may be debated this many decades into

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,319
the cyber environment um but we should

231
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
not discount the pup the possibility of

232
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
built from the blue attacks in different

233
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,280
crisis moments

234
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
we also have problems with technology

235
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
innovation that is the classic sputnik

236
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
moment where the average company does

237
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
something using a technology stack we

238
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
did not think they possessed to a degree

239
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,479
of sophistication we did not understand

240
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,919
that they had

241
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,599
we can also talk about capabilities

242
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,879
innovation

243
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,039
where an adversary uses a series of

244
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,000
known technologies and puts them

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
together in a novel way to achieve

246
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
something we didn't think that they

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,479
could achieve

248
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
um in this case aubameyang the iranian

249
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,440
large-scale distributed denial of

250
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,719
service attacks against the u.s and

251
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,880
global financial sector is a great

252
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,719
example

253
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,480
we can also take talk about the idea of

254
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
conception breaks

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
or as

256
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,959
one analyst calls it the uda shear the

257
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,320
observe oriented side act loop shear the

258
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,040
conception was

259
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
the idea of a general estimate of

260
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
consensus that takes hold within a given

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
crisis moment

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,040
when the adversary's actions are outside

263
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,839
of

264
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,560
that consensus estimate you have

265
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
conception break and of course the most

266
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,160
recent of these examples

267
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,680
is the retreat from afghanistan

268
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
i call out kinetic examples here because

269
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
they're easy to grasp these principles

270
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
in very quick moments we'll talk about

271
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,640
them in cyber much more

272
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
i'll give you a series of caveats

273
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
however to

274
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,920
the

275
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
idea that surprise is inevitable because

276
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
the great cia analytic tradecraft expert

277
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,959
jack davis um was very much opposed to

278
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,080
this idea

279
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,760
because of surprises inaudible there is

280
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,320
no role for intelligence we simply fail

281
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,200
and none of us can accept this

282
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
and it's not just a matter that we are

283
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
intelligence professionals that we call

284
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,519
ourselves intelligence professionals we

285
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,959
must do the work

286
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
even if the work only gets us so far

287
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
you know in one way we can say we're

288
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
taking up arms against the safe troubles

289
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
and by our actions making that

290
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,120
difference

291
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,839
and

292
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,600
that's a strong motivation to come in

293
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
every day to keep

294
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
in that fight

295
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
um we're also going to talk a little bit

296
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,600
about the problem

297
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
that warning is not always a specific

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
dedicated function in an intelligent

299
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
shop in some organizations in the

300
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
national environment that was true for a

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,519
period of time

302
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,760
the j-2 within the military intelligence

303
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
organization has a specific warning

304
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,720
function there was for a time a national

305
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
intelligence officer for warning

306
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
but we have shifted over time to think

307
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,480
about

308
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
warning as a

309
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
obligation on every intelligence element

310
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
so every analyst is a warning analyst

311
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,839
but of course uh as we know from the

312
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
incredibles if everyone is special no

313
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
one is does

314
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
if you assume warning is being done

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,279
somewhere in your organization

316
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,600
and you're not therefore in the to do it

317
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,040
does that warning actually get done

318
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
properly

319
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
so in this case i i like to think of

320
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,440
warning analysts as a forlorn hope you

321
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,560
may be that

322
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
individual that is the first to drive

323
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,839
and do with the breach

324
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,480
the first to charge into the guns

325
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
when there is a crisis or when there's a

326
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,959
moment

327
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,720
it may mean you're the one that takes

328
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,640
the most fire organizationally among

329
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,680
your peers

330
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
but it still is a job that needs to be

331
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,839
done

332
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,720
among the folks that have done that job

333
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
exceptionally well over the years is the

334
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,360
great lady of warning ms cynthia gravo i

335
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
truly wish we had a better picture of

336
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,279
cynthia i have been

337
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
impressing greatly upon the defense

338
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
intelligence agency the need for an

339
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
official portrait that is more

340
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
flattering but unfortunately this is

341
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
what we have at the moment

342
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
when we talk about the great lady

343
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
warning um she wrote one of the better

344
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,800
texts

345
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,279
um in the 1970s unfortunately he was

346
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
buried for a number of decades until my

347
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
friend jan herring worked very hard to

348
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,160
get this declassified

349
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
but one of the most important things

350
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
that cynthia had to tell us is that

351
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
warning is an intangible this theory a

352
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,040
belief

353
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
it's a hypothesis and hypothesis

354
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,959
obviously of intelligence folks tend to

355
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,200
be very important

356
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,880
its validity cannot be confirmed or

357
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
refuted until it is too late

358
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
intelligence is not about writing

359
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
what happened already it's about what is

360
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
to come

361
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
if journalism is the first draft of

362
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,200
history

363
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,440
then intelligence is the first draft of

364
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,720
journalism

365
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
and as a result you may be wrong

366
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
and it's important to have that

367
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,920
forward-looking perspective in our work

368
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,480
there are very subtle distinctions of

369
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,519
language

370
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,959
when we're talking about the classic

371
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,320
indications of morning tradecraft

372
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
classical warning

373
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
indicators are these abstracted discrete

374
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
elements of a modeled course of action

375
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,839
by which an adversary manifests threat

376
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,360
capabilities and intentions against its

377
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
target and its attack surfaces and

378
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
exposures these are the things we can in

379
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,000
theory say an adversary must do as part

380
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
of process preparation and execution to

381
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
achieve

382
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
surprise or to achieve actions

383
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,720
on objective or actions against

384
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
objectives

385
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,519
the indication are the concrete

386
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
observables we have identified through

387
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
collection that represents evidence that

388
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
that abstract indicator is actually

389
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
happening now or happening within the

390
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
horizon of warning

391
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,519
abused this language immensely over the

392
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,680
years because we all talk about these

393
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
iocs

394
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
indicators of compromise

395
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,240
um well

396
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,519
iocs are both prior evidence

397
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,000
collected that something has happened

398
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
that is an adversary's use of an

399
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
infrastructure an adversary's tooling

400
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,399
artifacts some other observable within a

401
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,000
networked environment

402
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
um but it's also

403
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
the abstracted idea that if you see

404
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,240
something like this in your environment

405
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,480
you have a concrete

406
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,720
problem at the current point

407
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,279
that's a very narrow and tactical and

408
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,959
technical view

409
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:57,760
of

410
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
indications so we have to think very

411
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
hard when we use this language and we

412
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,320
tend to abuse it and um think we're

413
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
doing things we're not when we're doing

414
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,199
warning

415
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,079
so instead let's talk about what makes

416
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
for a good indicator these abstract

417
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,320
ideas that we're thinking about well

418
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
first of all it's got to be detachable

419
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,199
if you don't have a collection system

420
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
that can observe adversary activity of

421
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
this nature

422
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
you're not going to be able to think

423
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,240
about the adversary's behavior

424
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
it's got to be diagnostic ideally it

425
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,279
should be indicative of only a single

426
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,360
process towards a net adversary's

427
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
hostile course of action um

428
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,279
and

429
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,760
only

430
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,720
capable of being

431
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
executed by that adversary unfortunately

432
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,959
in the real world a lot of folks can

433
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,320
take similar actions that may have

434
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
different outcomes they may have

435
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,320
actions that other third parties in the

436
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
environment can imitate uh as deception

437
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,720
measures

438
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,680
so

439
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,600
not

440
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
indicators will be as diagnostic as we

441
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,959
would like

442
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,279
they must be reliable however they must

443
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,519
be something that we can routinely

444
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,279
believe is a

445
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
common set of actions or thing that the

446
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
absurd has been doing and will continue

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,440
to do

448
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,880
it's no good to have indicators that the

449
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
adversary abandoned decades ago or

450
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,519
months ago in an intrusion

451
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,199
and of course they must be early

452
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,880
i'll throw in a very quick plug for

453
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
the text target-centric intelligence

454
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,360
this is when you're working with

455
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
indicators understanding an adversary's

456
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
processes understanding their doctrine

457
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,480
their organization their training

458
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
material leadership education personnel

459
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,360
facilitates policy all these abstracts

460
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
and intangibles

461
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
that lead to different behaviors against

462
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
which you can collect are all incredibly

463
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
important to developing your indicators

464
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,160
for a given crisis

465
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
so we also talk about

466
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
the

467
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,880
uh we will talk a little bit about

468
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
instead of the theory of this how we

469
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
move to warning line intelligence

470
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
assignments right warning doesn't just

471
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,000
emerge from the simple compilation of

472
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,120
facts

473
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
we talk often

474
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
about the idea that hashes or didn't

475
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
happen

476
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,160
well

477
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,519
unfortunately when we're talking about

478
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,040
future adversary courses of action and

479
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
behaviors those things have not yet

480
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,320
happened

481
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,079
therefore you won't have a hash you

482
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,959
won't necessarily have a log entry that

483
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,279
will describe the adversary's behavior

484
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
to come by the time you see that log

485
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
entry it's generally too late

486
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,399
um

487
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,480
it's not merely current intelligence i

488
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
won't dive too much into the tyranny of

489
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,880
current intelligence because uh my my

490
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
colleague chairman true will be doing an

491
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,959
entire talk on this this afternoon

492
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,639
um but it's very important to understand

493
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
that the more we are working on

494
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,800
describing and explaining behaviors that

495
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,399
are happening now

496
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,279
the

497
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
greater our challenges of estimating

498
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
future outcomes become we get sucked

499
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,519
into the now we get sucked into what we

500
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,480
know

501
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,399
it also requires that inferences be

502
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
drawn

503
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,160
you've got to go beyond what you've seen

504
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,679
already and you've got to create this

505
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,640
hypothesis defend this hypothesis

506
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
it's not just a matter of fortune

507
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
telling right we're not issued a crystal

508
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,559
ball

509
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,160
that we can magically understand where

510
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,359
the adversary comes from and what

511
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
they'll be doing next

512
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,280
um

513
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
and contrary to some of the tops in

514
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
previous years at sans unfortunately

515
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,359
good warning requires a degree of

516
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,520
attribution you have to understand who

517
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
this adversary is how their

518
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
organizations work what their behaviors

519
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,679
are how they think about problems to

520
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,200
understand what those courses of action

521
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
are you're not going to know

522
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,360
what is in their minds

523
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,400
but intelligence is built on behavioral

524
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
observations and you're going to need to

525
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
understand those behaviors

526
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
ultimately however in any time you're

527
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,160
targeting another hostile foreign

528
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,679
intelligence service a hostile military

529
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,840
service a mercenary contractor

530
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
there are many limits to the collection

531
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,120
capabilities that you have

532
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
you've got to therefore be incredibly

533
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
mindful of those limits and be able to

534
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,000
identify the gaps and account for

535
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,240
adversaries and inception in those gaps

536
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
we'll throw a quick series of case

537
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
studies out for you to make this a

538
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
little more practical

539
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,880
in

540
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,520
your in a way that you can

541
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
understand

542
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
um

543
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
sorry i lost a slight click there

544
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,200
the first case study of course is the

545
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,360
2017 uh

546
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
wannacry incident

547
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
this is a difficult case

548
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
we all

549
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
faced this issue we all went through

550
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,559
this crisis

551
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
ultimately the adversary started a

552
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,520
series of shifts towards financial

553
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,400
theft

554
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
to supportive variety proliferation and

555
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,559
regime regime objectives

556
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,880
that weren't fully recognized within the

557
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,520
cyber threat intelligence community um

558
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,080
as the adversary was developing up their

559
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,440
teams they began in february

560
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,799
of 2017 to test a series of ransomware

561
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,960
variants that they would

562
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,840
later exploit for a variety of

563
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,919
future operations those ransomware

564
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,520
variants were understood and very

565
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
specific warning was

566
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,919
or reporting was issued within different

567
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,360
industry shops

568
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,320
by

569
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,000
april of 2017.

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and for unfortunately those samples

571
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
weren't really looked at right there was

572
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,360
uh we talked about the signal versus

573
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
noise we talked about the inadequate

574
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
examination of evidence in this case

575
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,080
um there was code overlap and reuse from

576
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,360
these samples

577
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,400
into

578
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
the payload that eventually became

579
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
wannacry

580
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
um

581
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
we we talked a little bit about the

582
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
pathology of inadequate understanding of

583
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
precedent as a warning problem

584
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,039
well the adversary in this case had been

585
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,799
doing a lot of work on lateral movement

586
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
through smb exploitation

587
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
so of course when eternal blue was

588
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
leaked from

589
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,720
uh an alleged uh government holding in

590
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
april 2017

591
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,240
it was quite natural that the adversary

592
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
would pick up on a better way to conduct

593
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,799
smb exploitation and incorporate this

594
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,640
very quickly into

595
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
its operations

596
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
unfortunately we also have a problem

597
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
here of the misjudgment of time

598
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,919
when the adversary executed its uh

599
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,280
fires on 12 may of 2017

600
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,480
we

601
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
have a challenge of understanding

602
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,960
whether or not that was intentional at

603
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
the point in time that they pulled that

604
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,720
trigger um i argue actually that this

605
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
was a misfire the officer did not mean

606
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,120
to release that code worldwide at the

607
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
manner in the time that it did

608
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
it's very hard

609
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,600
to issue warning about an adversary's

610
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
own mistakes

611
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
it's a very difficult product to write

612
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
because you you can talk about an

613
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
adversary's intent to develop a

614
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
capability you can talk about how they

615
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
might use that capability you can talk

616
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,559
about where they're going with the

617
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,000
overall objectives of having that

618
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
capability

619
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,360
but when they fail and create a

620
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
worldwide incident well that's a very

621
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
difficult warning moment

622
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,400
um there are some things that could have

623
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,080
been written ahead of time

624
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,919
folks were not writing specifically and

625
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
i'm not aware of anyone that did i

626
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
certainly did not myself

627
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,640
write a product talking about the

628
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
incorporation of

629
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,960
uh the new exploits within existing

630
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
programs in the way that we saw them

631
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,080
emerge during those hard months of 2017.

632
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
um and ultimately it comes down to a

633
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
reluctance to believe

634
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,280
the april 27 reporting uh april 2017

635
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
reporting regarding this campaign uh and

636
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,600
its ongoing testing since december of

637
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
2016 was received with substantial

638
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,240
skepticism when it was discussed among

639
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,520
some of the industry professionals that

640
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,640
i know

641
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,559
there was an unwillingness to accept the

642
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,400
crossover between

643
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
criminal malware

644
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,120
and

645
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
state-sponsored intrusion activities for

646
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,400
this actor

647
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
now we can talk about this this has been

648
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,679
a debate we've had for

649
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,240
9 15 years across russian actors across

650
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
the iranian actors every time it comes

651
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,080
up into debate but it's something we

652
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,320
have to think about

653
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
um

654
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,919
the second case i'll walk through very

655
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,440
quickly

656
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
is

657
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,480
the issue of spectrum meltdown and other

658
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
side channel execution

659
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,320
in 2017 a series of academic researchers

660
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
developed novel side channel

661
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,919
exploitation techniques speculative

662
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,400
exploitation techniques uh that worked

663
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
against basically every processor

664
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
introduced

665
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
since about 1998.

666
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,240
this was an incredible bit of work and

667
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,640
it had widespread implications of the

668
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
industry i won't go too much into the

669
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
vulnerabilities themselves we have

670
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
literally dozens of talks talking about

671
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,840
the related

672
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,799
sets of

673
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,159
issues involved

674
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,720
but it's important to know that industry

675
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,000
was given early access through

676
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

677
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,880
and a lot of the key stakeholders that

678
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
were important in this process did not

679
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
actually know about this

680
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,200
um unfortunately in the six months

681
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,600
between roughly between when this became

682
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
an issue for industry

683
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,280
and when the embargo broke in january of

684
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,919
2018 and it became public that the these

685
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,360
vulnerabilities could be exploited in

686
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,120
the manner that they could be exploited

687
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,919
um

688
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,760
that wasn't widely understood by some

689
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,880
folks that really

690
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,559
needed to know about this

691
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,559
for example the white house

692
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,480
i've seen a white house official uh

693
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
indicated that they had no advanced

694
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,679
knowledge of this and i believe the

695
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,039
gentleman he's a man of honor and when

696
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
he says this i i believe what he had to

697
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,600
say

698
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,440
um but unfortunately we have industry

699
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
reporting that the chinese ministry of

700
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
state security for example had early

701
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,240
access and awareness of this

702
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,840
vulnerability

703
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
by the end of january 2018

704
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
there were commercial commercially

705
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
available exploit

706
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,159
options

707
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,840
for these vulnerabilities they were

708
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
incorporated into

709
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,400
certain high performance tooling sets

710
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,600
it's highly likely that sometime in

711
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,240
mid 2017 that the adversary had similar

712
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,159
capabilities

713
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,240
we kick off from that point in time a

714
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,520
series of related exploitation research

715
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,840
lines which resulted in some incredibly

716
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,120
staggering

717
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,760
and staggeringly useful vulnerabilities

718
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
all circling around this idea of weird

719
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,039
machine states that house our flight

720
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,080
talks about

721
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,760
i won't go too much into those

722
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,559
additional vulnerabilities but each one

723
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,080
of those had a period of early

724
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
observation uh largely coming out of the

725
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,679
academic environment and we have a

726
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,840
series of adversaries that sought to

727
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
incorporate these capabilities very

728
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,679
quickly into their arsenals

729
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
and i still do not believe we have an

730
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,760
adequate understanding of how

731
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
that progression has occurred throughout

732
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,799
a variety of programs it's a very

733
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,360
high-end capability it's your classic

734
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,840
technology surprise

735
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,320
particularly when it comes down to

736
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
sets of targets where we have to rip out

737
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
the hardware involved in order to get

738
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,279
effective mitigation

739
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,039
the

740
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,600
reason why i'm so firmly of the opinion

741
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
that this is a problem

742
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,600
is in 2021

743
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
we have a set of chinese strategic

744
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
support force

745
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
authors that are openly writing about

746
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,360
capabilities from our micro

747
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
architectural update subversion

748
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
and other associated exploitation

749
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,640
in their own internal journals

750
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
and to make matters worse we have a

751
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
sanctioned russian contractor

752
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
allegedly working for their foreign

753
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
intelligence services

754
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,799
whose staff are openly mocking

755
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,559
the pla ssf for not being anywhere near

756
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,919
as advanced

757
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,440
in their understanding of this problem

758
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
their ability to leverage these

759
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,440
capabilities and offensive purposes

760
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,760
as this contractor's own internal

761
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,120
research

762
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,520
that's a moment where you might think

763
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,880
it's an indication that we've been

764
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,640
caught a bit flat-footed here that there

765
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
is a very large surprise on the horizon

766
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,719
that might be something we care about

767
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,600
the third case i will throw out is a

768
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,360
little bit different in that we have

769
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,080
okay it's a surprise that hit all of us

770
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
it's something we had variable partial

771
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
visibility on but it's also the first

772
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,919
time i want to talk about a corrective

773
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,080
to how we break away how we fix

774
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,799
conception breaks or fix user shooters

775
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,200
um of course we all understand

776
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,960
the attractiveness of supply chain

777
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,200
operations to enable future intelligence

778
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
targeting we've seen a variety of these

779
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
over the years whether it was dragonfly

780
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
delivering havoc implants um back in the

781
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,720
mid part of the past decade whether it

782
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
was

783
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,520
a series of

784
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
operations by various chinese

785
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,840
actors including things like shadow pad

786
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
or cc cleaner

787
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,279
ultimately though when we look at

788
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,240
russian

789
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,360
operators

790
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,279
during this key period of time we

791
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,039
understand that they faced a substantial

792
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,320
setback

793
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,559
and there were according to public open

794
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,400
source reporting

795
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
widespread compromises of

796
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,799
the adversary's capabilities uh

797
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
particularly related to

798
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,520
apt-29 and cozy there

799
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
in which early warning was being

800
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
provided early

801
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
access and understanding of those

802
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
capabilities was being described it

803
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,880
meant the adversary was going to change

804
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
and if i think all the folks that have

805
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
been to this conference year over year

806
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,400
remember the debates we had when uh

807
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,919
certain of the well-understood sets of

808
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,840
adversary tooling disappeared and when

809
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
the adversary began to change this

810
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,840
behavior we kept talking about where did

811
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,760
they go how do we think about what that

812
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,520
change meant

813
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,880
but we have this conception that they're

814
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
going to come back using

815
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,039
sets of malware and sets of capabilities

816
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,960
in the manner we've previously seen

817
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,320
there was a

818
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
common rotational cycle to their

819
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,320
operations there was a common uh almost

820
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
budgetary programmatic

821
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,200
uh

822
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
pipeline for new tooling capabilities

823
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,880
implants and we

824
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
had other presentations over the years

825
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,520
they've talked about what those

826
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
pipelines meant

827
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,520
the general conception was that it

828
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,640
simply was another step in that pipeline

829
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
but here we have a capabilities

830
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,559
innovation moment where the adversary is

831
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,760
able to put together some things that

832
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,120
they already had

833
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,600
in new ways and do something an entirely

834
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
different mission operation outside of

835
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,039
our existing conception of what they

836
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,880
would do

837
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,760
now

838
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,480
i miss this as much as anyone

839
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
but i do something myself in my work

840
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
particularly um that might be useful to

841
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
you all which is the concept of analytic

842
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
divergence

843
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,720
to take random material

844
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,559
throw it against the wall and try to

845
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,880
think about what that would mean for the

846
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
adversaries you care about

847
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
i happen to love this magical realism

848
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
bot it throws out basically it's a

849
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,720
markov predictive uh engine that throws

850
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,960
out some randomness um

851
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,640
and it helps me think about problems

852
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,559
that i'm already chewing on somewhere in

853
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,960
the back of my head that are bothering

854
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,320
me in a way i can't necessarily

855
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
consciously articulate but allows me to

856
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,440
call out something differently

857
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,399
than i would otherwise um

858
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,559
unfortunately a tweet is not a warning

859
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,559
intelligence product so yes while i

860
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,760
wrote this particular tweet um within

861
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
uh roughly 60 days of the adversary

862
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,240
beginning concluding their testing and

863
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
within 30 days of

864
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,880
the delivery of the capability that

865
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
would be

866
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,000
holiday bear

867
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,320
solar winds

868
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,640
nobelium

869
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
this never went further

870
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480
and ultimately

871
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,919
i also called it wrong because i was

872
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,360
thinking about the california startup

873
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,000
website oh well silicon valley is dead

874
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,559
the austin is the new silicon valley in

875
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
one way of thinking and of course

876
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
targeting solar winds in austin was much

877
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,520
more effective to the adversary than

878
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,679
targeting a variety of folks in our

879
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,840
usual haunts out in san jose

880
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,000
ultimately i can talk through these case

881
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,159
studies but how do we come down to

882
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,679
action on warning

883
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,440
right actionability is quite important

884
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
but it's only one of the axes of

885
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
intelligence value we can talk about

886
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,080
timeliness we can talk about relevance

887
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,320
coherence completeness um all these

888
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
other factors

889
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,320
ultimately this requires more than the

890
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,559
intelligence project itself it requires

891
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,279
operations engagement

892
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,520
um

893
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,120
how would you make those cases actual

894
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,880
well in the first case

895
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,480
a lot of folks had to react to a new

896
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
threat actor they had to identify

897
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
external exposures they had to mitigate

898
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,200
lateral movement options in ways they

899
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,399
weren't used to

900
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,000
they should already have been doing so

901
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,080
based on the vulnerability exposure but

902
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,600
vulnerability is only one axis

903
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
vulnerability plus specific threat

904
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,520
adoption against one's interest drives a

905
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
different level of prioritization and a

906
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,799
number of organizations would have done

907
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,640
so differently

908
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,799
in case study two we can talk about how

909
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,720
we review it acquisitions planning how

910
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,960
do you accelerate replacement cycles for

911
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,039
older hardware how do you explore novel

912
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,120
detection of capabilities in your

913
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,320
environment

914
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,679
in case study three you can talk about

915
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,279
the about evaluating controlled

916
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,960
definition of updates

917
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
including the deliberate goat operations

918
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,520
as we've talked about in multiple years

919
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,960
of course how do you review detection

920
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,120
coverage for things that

921
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,039
were potentially

922
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,720
useful to the adversary in those

923
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,720
environments

924
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,120
when we think overall about the entire

925
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,559
problem warning i want to leave you with

926
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,720
a few takeaways how do you evaluate

927
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
incremental change

928
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,240
in your adversaries this is often more

929
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,760
challenging than assessing disruptive

930
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
discontinuities how do you focus on

931
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,480
specific problems

932
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,399
rather than thinking about all the

933
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,000
threats globally how do you state a

934
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,279
warning problem relevant to your

935
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,080
organization your enterprise

936
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,679
ultimately how do you break out beyond

937
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,000
naive predictions that is the idea that

938
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,679
tomorrow will be like today the threat

939
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,519
will always increase and this is less

940
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,519
useful than asking why or what next in

941
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,279
the adversary's capability and

942
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,640
ultimately you must understand that

943
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,279
warning is not a product of consensus if

944
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,440
twitter sock is all agreeing with you

945
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
someone is probably wrong

946
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
right and you've got to be willing to

947
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,559
take a stand you've got to be willing to

948
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
write that product that challenges that

949
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,159
consensus that breaks away from the

950
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,279
conception

951
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,279
and ultimately the products you don't

952
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,640
that you do not write are the ones that

953
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,559
will haunt you the most i talk about

954
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,640
this from a place of personal sorrow

955
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,679
because i should have written some

956
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,240
products here

957
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
warning is a process it's not a single

958
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,080
act

959
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,559
there is no warning if the warning is

960
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,640
not read is written but not believed or

961
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,480
believed but not really taken aboard and

962
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
acted upon

963
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,880
right the consumer must hear believe and

964
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,320
act for warning to occur

965
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,640
and ultimately we must remember warning

966
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,039
is the first purpose of intelligence but

967
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,880
it's not the singular purpose

968
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,159
intelligence is asked to do more than

969
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,159
one thing in support of decision makers

970
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,360
warning must be a priority but it is not

971
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,919
the only anticipatory intelligence need

972
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,919
it's all a spectrum it all demands

973
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,880
balance

974
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,799
i will leave you with the image of the

975
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,760
title

976
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,159
type walker which is on the columbia

977
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,519
campus uh set up a memorial of wild bill

978
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,760
donovan the founder of the office of

979
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,000
strategic services in world war ii

980
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
because it's the best analogy i can give

981
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,919
you to the problem we face conducting

982
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,080
warning conducting balancing warning

983
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,760
across all the other things we're being

984
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,880
asked to do

985
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,640
but those are all things we can talk

986
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,960
about later i'll leave with a few

987
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,159
resources

988
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,760
different books these are in the slide

989
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,919
deck that will be out this week and i

990
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,960
stand by for your questions and comments

991
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,600
thank you very much
