00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,519
presentation and i immediately

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,360

um a plan for my team maybe my team

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,039
members are like yeah we're gonna dive

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,760
guess i'm not going gonna do a deep dive

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,120
on that threat

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
this is a challenge we all face and i am

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,160
so excited to introduce sherman cheer to

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
talk to us a little bit about current

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
intelligence and how to manage it so

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
sherman please take it away

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,399
thanks katie for the introduction let's

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,480

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,559
we're good to go we can see and hear you

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,440

great uh so once again thank you for the

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
introduction and for everyone else that

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
joined uh thank you for spending your

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
next 30 minutes or so as we explore a

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
topic of current intelligence the

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
tyranny of current intelligence

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
and how as a cti team can we manage the

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
tyranny

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,479
now i just want to quickly refer to the

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,400
gif and the title of my presentation

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
here

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,720
they're both from this hilarious movie

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
called spaceballs which is a parody of

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
star wars that came out in 1987 uh by

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
mel brooks

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,200
i highly recommend people uh check out

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
that scene you can probably find on

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
youtube as i believe it to be the best

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
fourth wall break ever in movie history

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,920
um by the way i barricaded my door

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
because my dog recently learned how to

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
open them by pawing the doorknob uh he's

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,799
a good boy but too good sometimes

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,880
um all right so let's begin by going

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,560
through today's agenda

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,680
so first

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,119
we'll go through the different types of

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,600
intelligence uh to include uh current

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,680
intelligence so that everybody will be

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
on the same page

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,920
next we will explore just what exactly

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,318
is the tyranny of current intelligence

61
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,440
so that

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,239
um it will also talk about uh sort of uh

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,080
the other uh types of you know

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,720
anticipatory and strategic intelligence

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,520
research intelligence so on so forth

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
uh hearing all about the negative things

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
about uh current intelligence we'll also

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
talk about you know whether we should

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,440
avoid current intelligence production

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
after that we will go through some of

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
the best practices that i have found

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
when it comes to managing the production

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
of current intelligence

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
and how we can mitigate the tyranny from

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
both within your cti team itself and

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
your intelligence stakeholders

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
uh lastly of course uh we will finish

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
the presentation off with a quick recap

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,200
and uh hopefully some time for some q a

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
live

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
okay so a quick introduction about

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,879
myself

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,800
uh once again my name is sherman chu and

84
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
i'm currently the technical lead for new

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
york city cyber commands cti team or

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
nyc3 for short

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
so we are tasked with the protection of

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,120
new york city government's information

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,360
system to include the many city

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
government agencies we have more than

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,480
100 of them

92
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,959
we also collaborate with other private

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,560
and public entities

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,920
that are critical to new york city's

95
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,000
functions and operations

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,959
so prior to joining to uh nyc3 i also

97
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,000
worked at a

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
major financial institution

99
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
and a threat intelligence vendor i am

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
also a us army vet

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
uh go army beat navy

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
one last thing before we begin all views

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,000
and statements are my own

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
and i do not represent my organization

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
so

106
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,399
let's start

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,720
okay so what is current intelligence

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
as defined by the u.s joint chief of

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
staff publication 2.0

110
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
uh it's basically

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,159
support for ongoing operations uh

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,439
involves the integration of time

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,080
sensitive all source intelligence and

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
information into concise objective

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
reporting on the current situation in a

116
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
particular area

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,159
that's a mouthful that's very word

118
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,159
there's a worthy description of current

119
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,280
intelligence

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
so more layman common definition of it

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,080
is

122
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,239
intelligence and information that deals

123
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,920
with issues that require immediate

124
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
attention of things that have recently

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
happened or is currently happening

126
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
so let's break it down further and look

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
at the specific characteristics of

128
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,440
current intelligence

129
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400
first

130
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
uh it is disseminated quickly to inform

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
consumers as soon as possible uh we want

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to get it to the uh intelligence

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
customer stakeholders right ricky tick

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
because there's this perceived time

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,520
sensitiveness that goes along with it

136
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
second

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
current intelligence goes through

138
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
minimal evaluation or interpretation

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
primarily due to the aforementioned

140
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
aspect in which we want to send it to

141
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,400
our customers asap

142
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
the intelligence cycle is abbreviated

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,960
and might even lightly touch or skip a

144
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
few phases such as processing or

145
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
analysis

146
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,639
third

147
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
actionability is not mandatory

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,520
meaning current intelligence can largely

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
be used as an fysa or for your situation

150
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
uh situational awareness to your

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
customers

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
it may or may not help customers with

153
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
reducing uncertainty and making better

154
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
decisions uh when it comes to empowering

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
security posture for your organization

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
it could include anything that may be of

157
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,919
interest to the customer right now

158
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,680
now i also want to highlight that there

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
is a subtle difference between current

160
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,120
and tactical intelligence but more on

161
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
that later

162
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
i skipped the slide but one famous

163
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
example of current intelligence is the

164
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,360
uh us presidential daily brief or the

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
pdb hence the west wing gif on the

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,120
previous slide

167
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,479
uh potus receives a roundup of

168
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,400
innovation and intelligence on current

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
events around the world on daily basis

170
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
uh it doesn't always include assessments

171
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
and recommendations with each line on

172
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,680
the pdf

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
sorry pdb um

174
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
and uh

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,039
and he and the uh and you know it is one

176
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
of the highly sought after sort of daily

177
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,520
events right uh with the administration

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
so aside from current intelligence there

179
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
is anticipatory intelligence and uh

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,680
intelligence research

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,400
uh anticipatory intelligence is by

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
nature anticipatory

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
so we've already heard jd work and here

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
at jan's presentation and both of their

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,479
presentations are prime examples of

186
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,479
anticipatory intelligence which you know

187
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,680
focused on

188
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,840
indications and warnings and forecasting

189
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,759
respectively

190
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,560
so overall uh anticipatory intelligence

191
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,039
helps identify emerging trends changing

192
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,160
conditions

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
and under-appreciated developments

194
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,919
it's

195
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,759
generally not time sensitive meaning you

196
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,479
are

197
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,039
aggregating synthesizing knowledge

198
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
and uh the suspense state for for the

199
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
end product itself is largely determined

200
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
by your team's capacity and the

201
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
objective of the product itself

202
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
so essentially you're mostly setting

203
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
your own suspend date

204
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,759
intelligence research involves answering

205
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
a quest a customer's question

206
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,400
or

207
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
any standing intelligence requirements

208
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
that you may have

209
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
we need to work through a definition of

210
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
the issue project plan uh conduct

211
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,400
research

212
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
and produce finished report

213
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
kind of like what you've done in college

214
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
or grad school right finishing up the

215
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,880
dissertation

216
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
uh the sort of midterm essay if you will

217
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,639
it can be on almost any topic

218
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,639
so long as a research topic is one where

219
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,800
a cti customer needs to have an answer

220
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,400
too

221
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,479
so for example if you're running a cti

222
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
shop that uh does rfis or it requires

223
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
for intelligence for customers

224
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,800
a large number of set products are going

225
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
to be research intelligence in nature

226
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,479
uh other long-form threat surface uh

227
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,919
intelligence research may include like

228
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,680
threat surface assessments

229
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
um and perhaps threat landscape uh

230
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,840
threat landscaping which is another talk

231
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
by her yarn i think last year

232
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,720
so at this point you may say a hold of a

233
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,919
minute what about tactical operational

234
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319
and strategic intelligence

235
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,560
well great question sherman

236
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
so tactical operation on strategic

237
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
intelligence are largely intelligence

238
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,560
that serves a specific group of audience

239
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,479
and are designed to fundamentally inform

240
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,840
decision making

241
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,919
and empower defensive courses actually

242
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,840
so in a nutshell

243
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
it's about intended audience and

244
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
actionability

245
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,280
so first tactical and current

246
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,720
intelligence are closely related as i

247
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
mentioned previously but are not exactly

248
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,399
the same

249
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
both usually deal with immediate threats

250
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,080
and events uh both but current

251
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
intelligence can include anything that

252
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
may be of interest to the customer and

253
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
this sentence you you'll hear over and

254
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,279
over during this presentation

255
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,200
tactical is more specific

256
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,399
it provides information that the

257
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
customer needs to empower defense

258
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,080
such as detection rules and yara rules

259
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,680
uh hunt packages right

260
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,279
operational intelligence

261
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
is about production of specific types of

262
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,920
intelligence that is required

263
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,880
uh

264
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
for the technical audience that are

265
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
looking at the bigger picture right

266
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,920
they're

267
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,959
often

268
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,120
trying to allocate resources uh

269
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
anticipating any defensive gaps right

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
and trying to make sure that we have

271
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
defensive solutions to cover those gaps

272
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
so both research and anticipatory

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
intelligence

274
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
can help fill knowledge gaps that

275
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
operational audience may have

276
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
strategic intelligence about the

277
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
production of a specific type of

278
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
intelligence that is required for

279
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
foreign policy strategy

280
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,880
and plans uh related to your org

281
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
cybersecurity posture

282
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
strategic intelligence is almost always

283
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
a product of intelligence research

284
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
though so that's why the two concepts

285
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,319
are closely related

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
so now that we have gone through the

287
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
different types of intelligent products

288
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
uh let's dive into the concept of

289
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,519
tyranny and uh tyranny of current

290
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
intelligence

291
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,959
i'm sure people who have experience in

292
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,480
both traditional and cyber threat

293
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
intelligence have heard a term it has

294
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
many names aka tyrannier taskings aka

295
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
tyranny of the immediate aka tyranid

296
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
currency one more

297
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
aka tyranny of daily operations

298
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,480
those terms largely means the same thing

299
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
basically means focusing too many

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
resources on the production of current

301
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,279
intelligence

302
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,360
leading to a lack of other intelligence

303
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
products

304
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
uh it is tyrannical in nature because

305
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,480
it's hard to get out of it's hard to

306
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,839
peel your team

307
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,440
out of this cycle

308
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,399
um because of accustomed customers and

309
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,480
institute institutionalized workflows

310
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,399
so why and how does this happen what

311
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,160
leads to a cti team

312
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,079
become tyrannized by current

313
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,839
intelligence

314
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,959
well first

315
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
current intelligence is easy to produce

316
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,519
it's often you know it often doesn't

317
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
require long and rigorous assessment and

318
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
analytical effort

319
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
it's a quick churn product

320
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,839
you see something new from your sources

321
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,760
and you basically relate to customers

322
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,480
with very little analytical notations it

323
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
might not even include an assessment or

324
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,240
recommendation

325
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
there are two taskings one on an

326
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,800
in-depth study that is not time

327
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,839
sensitive

328
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,160
and a quick reaction task i.e current

329
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,279
intelligence

330
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,640
your team will likely tackle the one

331
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
that it can be done quickly first

332
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
uh that is true in almost any

333
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,279
professions

334
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
uh however there's always another time

335
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
sensitive task waiting when the first

336
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,040
one is complete hence the cycle

337
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
occurrence currency

338
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
uh another reason maybe

339
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,279
is because it provides instant

340
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,279
gratification to your customers and your

341
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
cti team

342
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
i mean customers immediately get hit

343
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
with new information or intelligence and

344
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,440
they feel temporarily satiated

345
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
and the cti team will almost always get

346
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
a quick thanks or some sort of uh short

347
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,160
instantaneous feedback

348
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
so the loop itself is very it's

349
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,040
shortened

350
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,880
and uh happens within a day

351
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
there is a heavy customer demand

352
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
some customers typically the strategic

353
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
level or executive level audience want

354
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
to know what what is happening around

355
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
the world justifiably so at times and

356
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
other times out of their appetite to

357
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,720
know what's you know what's a hot topic

358
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
what's juicy

359
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
um

360
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
executive stakeholders don't want to get

361
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
ambushed by board members or other

362
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
c-suite executives they want a need to

363
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
be the smartest person in the room when

364
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
it comes to smart cyber threats

365
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
we want to control narrative the threat

366
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
narrative to be uh more precise

367
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,839
uh as a cti shop or a team we want to

368
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,120
make sure that our customers are all

369
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
sharing the same threat picture

370
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,959
customers often go out and look for

371
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,320
their own sources they have their own

372
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
read lists right some of them have have

373
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,839
their own feedly uh or uh twitter

374
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,120
subscriptions

375
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,920
and

376
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,320
some of what they read may be inaccurate

377
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
or fun written uh fun meeting content

378
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
that is written to drive fear

379
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
uncertainty and doubt which are mortal

380
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
enemies of any cti shops and we have to

381
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,959
stop that out wherever we see it

382
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
conflating current and tactical

383
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,399
intelligence as i previously mentioned

384
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,760
tactical and current current

385
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,320
intelligence are very similar but they

386
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,839
are distinctly different in critical

387
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,040
ways

388
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,560
current intelligence can be topic that

389
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,399
once again interests the customer right

390
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,600
any topic

391
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,639
tactical empowers decisions and defense

392
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
cti teams and stakeholders may think

393
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
that they are producing or gaining

394
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
tactical intelligence but in truth

395
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,680
it isn't

396
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,959
so

397
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,160
essentially if it doesn't provide

398
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,519
actionability

399
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,720
it is actually current intelligence

400
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,279
and in other words an fysa is not

401
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,240
tactical intelligence

402
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,320
okay so

403
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
what's that oh what's the worst that can

404
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,199
happen

405
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,839
another great question sherman

406
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,839
first i would like to highlight this

407
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,760
quote from bruce clark who was a former

408
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,399
cia deputy director for intelligence

409
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
uh he said and i quote

410
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
intelligence research is putting money

411
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,959
into bank

412
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,399
current intelligence is making a

413
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,959
withdrawal

414
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
in-depth intelligent products basically

415
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
deposits back into your bank by arming

416
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,639
you with refined knowledge of the threat

417
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,480
landscape the threat surface or

418
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,079
defensive measures

419
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,600
current intelligence basically withdraws

420
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,880
from that account

421
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
to purchase customer gratification

422
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,760
and i can i believe

423
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
i can say on behalf of everybody here no

424
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,320
one wants to go bankrupt

425
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
and we can further break it down to two

426
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
core problems here that stems from the

427
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,399
tyranny itself

428
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
core problem number one

429
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,399
lack of capacity to produce other types

430
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
of intelligence products

431
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,959
so

432
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,480
there's little to no in-depth research

433
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
on threats with current intelligence

434
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,760
right and therefore finished

435
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
intelligence will eventually become

436
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,120
irrelevant to your organization's threat

437
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
model and will not provide

438
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,199
accurate and relevant findings for your

439
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,680
customers

440
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,720
lack of relevant guidance and defensive

441
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
value which ties to a previous issue

442
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,839
here

443
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,199
organizations will not be able to

444
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,680
appropriately assign and allocate

445
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,760
critical resources to defend against

446
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
relevant threats via finished

447
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,240
intelligence products

448
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,279
tunnel vision and peace no intelligence

449
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,360
which i think is very important to

450
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
realize is that your current

451
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,959
intelligence products are all one shots

452
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
and do not help with threading the

453
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
threat landscape or threat surface

454
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
together but there is no continuity of

455
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,399
analysis or

456
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,480
critical context to connect seemingly

457
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,880
unrelated data or information together

458
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
to really drive

459
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,680
uh the real threats that you should be

460
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
tracking

461
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,199
so overall

462
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,480
focusing

463
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
too many resources on current

464
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,720
intelligence can be detrimental to your

465
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
team's understanding of the real threats

466
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
versus the perceived threats

467
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
so this is a quote from a colleague of

468
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,800
mine and i tweeted it uh months ago

469
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,639
basically the person said

470
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,680
uh if cti is a restaurant we should use

471
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,959
fresh ingredients

472
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,480
follow recipes

473
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,079
and serve delicious and nutritious

474
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,360
dishes

475
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
as hard to say than imagine

476
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
instead we buy twinkies plate them

477
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
attractively drizzle on some intel

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,959
pizazz and charge customers for la goto

479
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,519
de la hostess

480
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,959
you know and to my response to that is

481
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,720
twinkies are tasty and having one or two

482
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
of them in your overall weekly diet is

483
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,360
fine

484
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
but you're bound to have nutritional

485
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,600
deficiencies and health problems if your

486
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,480
diet is based primarily on twinkies and

487
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
you know worst of all

488
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
current intelligence like twinkies are

489
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,880
tasty but also addictive

490
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
and by the way at this point i just want

491
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,279
to uh

492
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,560
basically

493
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,720
uh take a minute here and said that say

494
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,399
that this whole presentation isn't

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,480
taking a snipe at threat intelligence

496
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,600
vendors

497
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,359
the presentation is primarily focusing

498
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,839
on cti shops that operate within end

499
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,000
user organizations that serve to provide

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,359
intelligence to defenders and other

501
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,160
in-house organization stakeholders

502
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
sorry intel vendors have have keen

503
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
visibility into the front landscape via

504
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,679
their capture telemetry

505
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,439
but they often don't have the visibility

506
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
or capacity to analyze your

507
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
organization's threat surface and

508
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,799
security controls to derive a full

509
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,600
picture of the threat model

510
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,799
furthermore

511
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,080
intelligence vendors work on a very

512
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,679
different set of intelligence and

513
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,679
collection requirements when compared to

514
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,760
end users intelligence teams

515
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
generally speaking

516
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,039
uh threat intel vendors are fulfilling a

517
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,880
wide range of requirements that is

518
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
aggregated from from their clients which

519
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,559
spans many industry verticals and needs

520
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,320
okay moving on to core problem number

521
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
two

522
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,600
uh overproduction and the lack of

523
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
quality control

524
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,840
so first first off you you gain

525
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
short-term wins

526
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
but you lose long-term

527
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,919
as i previously mentioned

528
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,200
you get instant gratification and

529
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,559
perhaps praises

530
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,400
but the organization loses out on

531
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,120
intelligent products that can endure and

532
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,880
can provide long-term benefits to the

533
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,440
organization's security

534
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,080
mass quantity quality mess

535
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
it is really hard to control the quality

536
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,520
of quick churn for intel products

537
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
because you and your team will just not

538
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
have the time to review the content

539
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,480
rigor

540
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,280
objectivity of fast finished

541
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
intelligence

542
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,600
and you know as a cti shop that's like

543
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,440
driving 100 miles per hour down the

544
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,320
highway

545
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,720
danger zone right

546
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,919
and you know as a cti shop we live or

547
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
die by the credibility and integrity of

548
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,880
our products and assessments

549
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,039
third very important here

550
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,520
analysts will stagnate

551
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,400
current intelligence isn't challenging

552
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
and therefore analysts won't need to

553
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
expend as much brain juice and challenge

554
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
themselves

555
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,360
when crafting you know say in-depth

556
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,760
products long-form research intelligence

557
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
work

558
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
the lack of structured analytic

559
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
techniques will lead to stagnation

560
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,720
and you know personally i believe much

561
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,000
like learning and knowing a foreign

562
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,559
language it is a perishable skill if you

563
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,200
don't practice enough

564
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
there's one more here by the way uh and

565
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,559
that is

566
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,760
when you're under firing any current

567
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
intelligence you can't really derive

568
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,280
valuable metrics

569
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,760
um arguably arguably the only metric um

570
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,120
is the number of reports that you and

571
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,360
your team have created

572
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
current intelligence doesn't help you or

573
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
your organization understand how

574
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,120
impactful your cti program has been for

575
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,280
your organization's security posture

576
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
uh because oftentimes

577
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
there is no actionability or assessment

578
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
comes along with current intelligence as

579
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,320
i mentioned previously

580
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,200
okay so

581
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,559
should we avoid current intelligence

582
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,080
then it sounds like a nightmare it

583
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,280
sounds like

584
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
it's fundamentally detrimental to to

585
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
any infosec organization

586
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
to that i would say an unequivocal

587
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
that's a no for me dog we should

588
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
definitely not avoid current

589
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,559
intelligence

590
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,080
current intelligence itself is valuable

591
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,000
when done correctly

592
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,320
it's not practical to think of it as an

593
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
either or you know there is a need for

594
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,280
all types of intelligence as pertains to

595
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,640
your organization's

596
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,000
irs your intelligence requirements

597
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
as i've mentioned

598
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
current intelligence actually helps us

599
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,400
ensure customers

600
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
are sharing the same narrative and

601
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,840
picture of cyber threats that are

602
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,520
relative to your to the organization

603
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,640
itself

604
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,799
it also allows the cti team to be in

605
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,400
close touch with the customers which is

606
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
something that

607
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,640
often we forget

608
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,720
current intelligence reports from

609
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
vendors and other external sources are

610
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
valuable as i mentioned

611
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,400
uh but that doesn't mean that an end

612
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,919
user organization should just pass it

613
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,799
along to our customers without further

614
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,400
finding it or pairing it with our own

615
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,600
analysis

616
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
based on our fret surface

617
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,480
and defense

618
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,200
we as uh the cti shop

619
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
need to evangelize

620
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
a healthy mix of intel products

621
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,280
and help our stakeholders

622
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
uh understand that there's more out

623
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,640
there than current intelligence

624
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
all right so now let's get to some

625
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,679
solutions here

626
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,520
how do we avoid and minimize tyranny

627
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
so let's start off with managing tyranny

628
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,158
with the customers first

629
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,520
first and foremost define clear

630
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
intelligence requirements and plan out

631
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,320
precise products to support them

632
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,840
intelligence requirements are the cti

633
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,320
team's marching order we follow them so

634
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,960
that we can plan our capacity and employ

635
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,679
adequate capability to them

636
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,559
and with

637
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,400
with concise intelligent requirements we

638
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,679
can derive precise collection

639
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
requirements and

640
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,679
analytical capacity to answer said

641
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,240
requirements

642
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,880
ensure the customers and executives are

643
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,559
aware of the threat intel team's

644
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,200
resources and capacity

645
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
speaking of you know capability and

646
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,159
capacity we want to help our

647
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,600
stakeholders understand the limits of

648
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,520
powers of the cti team

649
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,679
by helping them know how much time blood

650
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,400
and sweat is needed to make the cti

651
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
sausage

652
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
stakeholders get a better picture of

653
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,960
what to expect and what to ask for

654
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
explain to your customers and executives

655
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,720
a detriment of primarily producing

656
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,559
current intelligence help them explain

657
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
the tyranny of uh help you know explain

658
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,919
to them what the tyranny of current

659
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,840
intelligence is and what can it do for

660
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,679
the organization right

661
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,440
uh take tidbits from from my

662
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,559
presentation

663
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,960
and and present it to them

664
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,080
but by helping customers and

665
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,000
stakeholders understand the side effects

666
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,320
of over allocating a team's capacity and

667
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,919
production of current intelligence

668
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,520
especially when you translate it to you

669
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,840
know a value proposition value loss sort

670
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,880
of speak

671
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,480
it can help prevent them from asking too

672
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
much of current intelligence

673
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
encourage your customers to want other

674
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
types of intelligence

675
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
you know use current intelligence like a

676
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,280
teaser trailer to the next big superhero

677
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,480
movie

678
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,880
and in our case long-form in-depth

679
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
research intelligence

680
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,120
there are no cti bylaws last time i

681
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
checked that stop us from hyping our

682
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
hyping up our own products

683
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,440
in fact it should be encouraged this is

684
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,120
a part of us managing customer

685
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,440
expectations uh within the sort of

686
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
threat intelligence practice

687
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
so let's move on to how do we manage it

688
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,360
within the cti team itself

689
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,480
analytic managers need to make sure that

690
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,159
the team has adequate capacity for

691
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,520
producing long-form in-depth

692
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,880
intelligence

693
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
this comes with thorough constructions

694
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
of intel requirements

695
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,919
once again and talking to your customers

696
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,120
about the team's capacity

697
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
analytic managers should

698
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
ensure that the team shares a solid

699
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,799
perspective

700
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,918
of the mission and goals

701
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,640
and this kind of ties to this point here

702
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,480
managers need to avoid sending mixed

703
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
signals to the analysts when it comes to

704
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,320
product prioritization

705
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,159
and this is a recurring problem that

706
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,679
i've observed personally as well as

707
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,960
talking to other members other

708
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,200
colleagues within the cti industry where

709
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,640
managers and analysts always seem to

710
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
have different perspectives

711
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,720
managers typically have a very solid

712
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,760
understanding of perspective of the

713
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
michigan goals uh they believe that they

714
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,200
share those goals with their team

715
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,159
members

716
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
uh however in contrast the analysts

717
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,279
frequently claim to have uncertain

718
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,880
came to be uncertain about mission and

719
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,480
goals

720
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,960
a common mixed signal issue comes from

721
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,279
the the synchronization between a need

722
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,640
for current intelligence and in-depth

723
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
intelligence

724
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
managers for example

725
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,840
uh will conduct you know periodic

726
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
analyst meetings that stresses the need

727
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
for in-depth research

728
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,240
but

729
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,159
the day-to-day guidance from them is

730
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,640
focused on responding to current

731
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,039
priorities and we need to avoid that

732
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,240
so

733
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,159
when you conduct requiring meetings make

734
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,120
sure it's on a more longer term a longer

735
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
term perspective right like meetings on

736
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,279
intelligence gaps and encouraging team

737
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,760
research

738
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
another good trick is to craft and

739
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,360
maintain another lines to establish

740
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
official analytic positions on high

741
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
demand topics

742
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,039
analytic lines can help standardize

743
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,760
common questions that your consumers may

744
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,799
have

745
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,559
and they should also include assumptions

746
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,799
and a consistently reviewed by the team

747
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,400
okay so let's recap and uh hopefully

748
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,039
some takeaways here

749
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,120
first

750
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,799
current intelligence deals with recent

751
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,400
and ongoing events that the customer

752
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,919
wants to know about

753
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,600
uh it can be once again it can be on any

754
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,520
topic that interests customers it is

755
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
often a quick turnaround product and

756
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,039
often does not contain assessments or

757
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,840
in-depth analysis

758
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,799
anticipatory and research intelligence

759
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,080
requires in-depth

760
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,000
effort which results in more endearing

761
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,480
impact to your organization

762
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,600
finnish intelligence that combines

763
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
evaluation of threat landscape analysis

764
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
your threat surface and comparing that

765
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,919
to our defensive measures will result in

766
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,000
better insights and critical findings to

767
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,080
our organization's security posture

768
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,440
it is super easy to fall into the

769
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,520
tyranny of current intelligence when

770
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,919
left unchecked

771
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,279
for example current intelligence is easy

772
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,279
for juice that's you and your customers

773
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,919
instant gratifications has a huge demand

774
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,279
and helps cti teams control their

775
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,120
certain narrative

776
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,640
all the reasons why it's so easy to

777
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,360
follow the tyranny

778
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,000
intelligence research is putting money

779
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,840
in the bank current intelligence is

780
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
making withdrawal

781
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,080
through analyze finnish intelligence

782
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,679
when you put in a bank you get dividends

783
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,200
the more you put in the more dividends

784
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,440
you get

785
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
avoid the tyranny by managing

786
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,120
expectations with customers and managing

787
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
capacity with you know and tasking with

788
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,320
your team

789
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,679
and we need to be transparent with our

790
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,960
customers and make sure that they

791
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,279
understand what we can and cannot do

792
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
we also need to encourage them to want

793
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
longer more impactful finished

794
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
intelligence that will require time and

795
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
capacity

796
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,039
and as for a cti team managers need to

797
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,960
make sure that the priorities

798
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,919
and tasks are synced up between yourself

799
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,919
and your team

800
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,080
always always avoid uh make signals and

801
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
conduct recurring meetings to discuss

802
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,399
about those intelligence gaps and uh

803
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,520
research topic as a t

804
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,279
and with that

805
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,919
thank you for spending your time with me

806
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,919
and i am now ready for any questions

807
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,639
you
