1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,160
uh hey everyone my name's lena i'm based

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,639
in sydney australia and i work in

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
incident response at secureworks prior

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
to working at secureworks i was also

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,440
doing incident response and threat

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,160
hunting at accenture

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,920
in my spare time i do like to publish a

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
lot of research and i do so on twitter

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,599
and also on my blog and my primary

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
interests lie in apt attacks mobile and

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,760
also cloud security

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
so today we're going to cover a few

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,399
things however my overall goal of the

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
presentation is to

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,399
i guess really demonstrate the impact

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,120
that chinese political goals have on the

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
style of attacks that are carried out by

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,600
chinese apt groups and throughout the

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,039
course of the last few years the

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,440
relationship between china and australia

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,640
has

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,520
you know soured and that has resulted in

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
an incredible uptick in the amount of

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
chinese alleged chinese apt cases that

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
we've seen and worked on at secureworks

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,080
so specifically throughout this

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
presentation i'm going to touch on four

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,400
attacks that i worked on

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
and show you how these goals or this

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
these attacks were linked to the overall

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,439
goals of the chinese communist party and

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,880
at the very end i'm going to talk a

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,720
little bit a little bit about china's

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
recruitment policies and thought

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
curriculums

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
so full disclaimer i am going to be

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,439
saying allegedly a lot because threat

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,960
intelligence is rarely ever 100 accurate

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680
but on top of this this presentation is

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,119
not a reflection of my personal

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
political views nor is it a reflection

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,159
of secureworks political views

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
so with that let's get into it

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
in 2012 right after xi jinping became

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,759
the general secretary of the chinese

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,840
communist party he announced something

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,720
called the chinese dream and in chinese

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,240
it's referred to as

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,000
means

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
which roughly translates to the great

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,520
rejuvenation

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,159
or revitalization of china

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,600
and this particular dream had two goals

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
the first one is for china to become a

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,239
well-off society or moderately wealthy

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,640
by 2021 which i do believe they have

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
achieved and the second is for china to

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,959
become a fully developed nation by 2049.

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,520
now from 2012 until today

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
these two pillars have been the

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
underlying crux of the xi jinping

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
administration

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
and on top of this you know all goals

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
kind of dwindle without some kind of

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,680
success measurement and in this instance

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,040
it is china

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
apologies it is china becoming a world

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,280
leading economy

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
and so as a part of this

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,519
china set up something called one belt

71
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
one road and basically this strategy is

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,519
to generate some kind of economic trade

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,720
dominance

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
and

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
the tldr for this is china is basically

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
financing leasing a set of ports and

77
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
hubs all across central asia and through

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,200
europe

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
and the purpose of these ports and hubs

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
is to facilitate trade and also maritime

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,080
access

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
and you know the initiative has taken an

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,840
immense amount of funding from the

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
chinese government

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,760
and the goals of this is to strengthen

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,159
financial cooperation with each of these

87
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,159
countries strengthening the trade

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
relations with these countries and also

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,200
to make lumen be the main trading

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
investment currency and i say maybe as

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,120
in the chinese currency itself

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,920
now getting one belt and one road to be

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,120
successful

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
it's not as simple as just you know

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
purchasing and leasing a set of ports

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,879
and hubs

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
there's also a series of strategies that

98
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,360
kind of underpin the push for this one

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,799
strategic movement

100
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,560
and one of this is a set of acquisitions

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,159
of course there are a lot of

102
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,319
acquisitions so i've had to just pick

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,720
and choose cherry pick and this one was

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,159
one that i found particularly

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,439
interesting

106
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
and this acquisition was cydic telecom

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,680
purchasing links telecommunications and

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
the reason why this is interesting is

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,319
because it gives china access to the

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,000
underlying telecommunications

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,440
infrastructure and services of 130

112
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,160
countries that coincidentally sit in

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
this belt and road region

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,720
and

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
i say that acquisitions are interesting

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
because of something called the chinese

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,800
national intelligence law

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,880
this is a law that states that all

119
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
chinese businesses

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
subsidiaries even located outside of

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,160
china and also all chinese citizens are

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,400
required by law to support assist and

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
cooperate with matters of national

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
intelligence and by that it means you

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
know all these people need to use all

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
the means tactics and channels that are

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,240
available to them in order to carry out

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
this work

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
we had an example in recent times of

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,720
what you know failure or quote-unquote

131
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
failure may have looked like

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,639
and this happened during the log 4j

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,080
vulnerability which i'm sure a lot of

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
you would be familiar with uh one of the

135
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
security researchers at alibaba cloud

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,039
found this vulnerability however they

137
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,919
did not

138
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,360
first disclose it to the chinese

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
government and that has resulted in a

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
series of punishing actions you know

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
financially punishing actions such as

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,440
chinese regulators suspending

143
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,280
partnerships with alibaba and several

144
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,600
contracts

145
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,240
now before i jump into the case study i

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
kind of want to touch on the diminishing

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
relationship between china and australia

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,919
because this directly links to these

149
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,280
four cyber attacks that i'm going to

150
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,400
cover

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
so i'm going to give a high level

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
timeline of this now so in 2012

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,400
australia you know we were setting up

154
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,360
our

155
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,680
national broadband network and we banned

156
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,160
huawei from putting in bids

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,280
in 2018 we actually banned huawei

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
completely from constructing any of our

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
critical infrastructure

160
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
that includes 5g

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,520
on top of banning it we proceeded to

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
urge the uk also not to take in bids

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,479
from huawei for 5g

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
in that same year we actually passed a

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
foreign interference law that made all

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,440
industrial espionage illegal

167
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,080
in 2020 china actually published a

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
dossier of 14 disputes or 14 grievances

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,960
with australia so these are things that

170
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
china's upset with australia about and

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
in that list it included things like the

172
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
banning of huawei and the blocking of

173
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
several chinese investments in australia

174
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,800
so from 2020 until 2021 more things

175
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
happened in 2020 australia pushed an

176
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,759
inquisition into the coronavirus

177
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
outbreak you can imagine that wasn't

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
received very well in 2021 australia

179
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,600
blocked china from investing in any of

180
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
our critical sectors like infrastructure

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
tech and you know energy

182
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,440
in 2021 australian government then made

183
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,000
a series of very public criticisms of

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
what china was doing in xinjiang with

185
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,360
the weak muslims in taiwan and also in

186
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,199
hong kong

187
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,840
now the nature of the china-australian

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
relationship is very interesting

189
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,639
because historically china has relied

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
very heavily on australia as we export

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
iron ore to china

192
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,800
and we also export gas oil and you know

193
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,479
coal so this is the mining and the

194
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
energy sector

195
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
following the tensions that happen in

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
2021

197
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
china released a five-year plan to end

198
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
their dependency on australia for iron

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
ore completely

200
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
this will have severe economic

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
repercussions for australia because

202
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
china is actually 36.5 of all of our

203
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
gross export shares

204
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
it will hurt the australian economy

205
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
and china's strategy to do so includes

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
importing iron ore from brazil and also

207
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
building an iron ore mine in the west

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,520
african mountain regions that spans 110

209
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
kilometers

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,960
now

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,039
bronze mohawk is a threat group that

212
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,080
secure actively tracks and this group

213
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
you may have seen referred to by other

214
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,319
vendors such as apt40 or maybe leviathan

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,639
and the reason i'm pulling this out is

216
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,720
because this particular threat group we

217
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
have actually seen been incredibly

218
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,919
active during the 2021 uh

219
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,840
year

220
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
in 2020 the australian government

221
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,080
actually released a very interesting

222
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,039
paper

223
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,680
and it was called the copy paste report

224
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,958
and this report was went on for 62 pages

225
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
and it said that a nation state was

226
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,279
targeting australian organizations

227
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,599
it did not state what country this

228
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,679
nation state is but i will leave the

229
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,120
inference up to you

230
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
it covered like a set of ttps that this

231
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,519
nation state was using including

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,360
breaching companies through

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,800
telerik sharepoint mobile iron the use

234
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,080
of ldifde tool abuse of legacy microsoft

235
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,120
365 and the use of dll search order

236
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
hijacking to install cobalt strike

237
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
coincidentally we've seen every single

238
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
one of these in cases that we've worked

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
from 2020 to 2021

240
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
and i'll go into this in a little bit

241
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
in 2021 right after the chinese

242
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
government released that they had

243
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
developed a plan to end their dependency

244
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,959
on australia's mining sector for iron

245
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,680
ore

246
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,000
one of our clients in the mining sector

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
experienced an alleged bronze mohawk

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,839
attack

249
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,680
the attack started with web scanning

250
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,440
which is you know very typical for a

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
large organization

252
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
this web scanning wasn't too aggressive

253
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,640
it actually blended in with the usual

254
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,279
web traffic but one thing that did stand

255
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,760
out was the use of nuclei and i say

256
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
nuclei is interesting because this then

257
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
became a recurring theme throughout

258
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
every single one of the bronze mohawk

259
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
engagements we worked on

260
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,959
they used nuclei to perform external

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,959
scanning and through that they found

262
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,880
that this client you know was running a

263
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
contractor portal which is very normal

264
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,279
for infrastructure-based clients

265
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
so then they found this portal and they

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
enumerated it and discovered it had a

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
series of sql injection vulnerabilities

268
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
naturally the attackers exploited that

269
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
and proceeded to use this you know sql

270
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
injection to start to attempt to

271
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
download security and system event logs

272
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
this is very interesting because

273
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
gathering the security and system event

274
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,600
logs would allow this threat actor to

275
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
you know enumerate the types of logins

276
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
that happen services that run and also

277
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
schedule tasks that run a lot of

278
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
interesting information

279
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
through sql the attackers then proceeded

280
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,279
to install a jsp webshell which i've got

281
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,720
you know a screenshot of the actual

282
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,440
webshell and this allowed the attackers

283
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,160
remote code execution onto the server

284
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,480
which they then proceeded to run a

285
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
series of commands using ldifde which i

286
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
said was mentioned in the australian

287
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
copy paste report

288
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
this is a microsoft owned tool that

289
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
allows enumeration of forests and

290
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,680
domains

291
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,000
i've also got a series of other commands

292
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
that they ran that i've got in the super

293
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,040
timeline

294
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
you know just usual credential

295
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
enumeration and then in pink i've

296
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
highlighted the command that they ran to

297
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
perform credential dumping now we kept

298
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
recurringly see

299
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,000
these alleged bronze mohawk attacks use

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
this method for credential dumping and

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
we did not see evidence of mimikats

302
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
being utilized

303
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,519
the end goal of the attack was for file

304
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,240
access and file enumeration and it was

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
very clear that this was the end goal

306
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
because the attackers started to

307
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
enumerate several documents pertaining

308
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,200
to mining and other

309
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
you know documents like that and it was

310
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
interesting because the attackers also

311
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,959
logged into three specific mailboxes and

312
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,959
they did this through leveraging legacy

313
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
authentication in microsoft 365 which

314
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,880
once again was referenced in the

315
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,360
australian copy paste report

316
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,079
on top of this the attackers also had an

317
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,079
awareness of several employees within

318
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,200
the business

319
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,920
like very in detail knowledge of these

320
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,200
people's existence and our hypothesis is

321
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,839
it's probably gleaned from linkedin but

322
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
of course that's difficult to prove and

323
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
at the very end of the investigation we

324
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
had collected around

325
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,399
30 different ips that the threat actors

326
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
used

327
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,639
literally right after this case finished

328
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,320
we got another case it kind of even

329
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
overlapped

330
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
this case was the energy sector big

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
surprise and this particular client had

332
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
received a high confidence alert from a

333
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,079
trusted third party and i do say trusted

334
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,920
because it was a trusted third party

335
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,079
that alleged bronze mohawk ips were

336
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,560
interacting with their environment

337
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
so we were called in to perform incident

338
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
response on this instance

339
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
and

340
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,760
the second we kind of jumped in we had

341
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
you know found a series of other ips but

342
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,480
these ips were all geo-located in

343
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,839
australia

344
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,639
but more interestingly they were

345
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
instances of compromised microtech

346
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
routers that the attackers were using to

347
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
proxy the attack in

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,480
once again similar ttp started to emerge

349
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
apologies including the use of nuclei

350
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,079
python and other open source tools

351
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,240
and it was really interesting because

352
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,399
after using nuclei the threat actors

353
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,880
once again zoned in on a contractor

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
portal which they then found a

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
vulnerability for that they then you

356
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,279
know exploited

357
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,480
that allowed them access to that server

358
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
and they proceeded to log in using

359
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
decommissioned third-party credentials

360
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,440
they created malicious user credentials

361
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
and then they proceeded to enumerate

362
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,519
documents hundreds of documents

363
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,680
pertaining to this client and they even

364
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,240
attempted to try and exploit sharepoint

365
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
which was interesting because they made

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
a series of remote procedural calls to

367
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,959
do so

368
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,760
and

369
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
interestingly enough one of the ips that

370
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,320
we witnessed in this particular incident

371
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,880
we had already seen prior that year on

372
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
one of another another one of our

373
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
clients that we worked on that

374
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
experienced an alleged bronze mohawk

375
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
attack

376
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
during the investigation

377
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,800
the clients also seemed like they had

378
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,399
some kind of a playbook that they were

379
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,600
trying to run

380
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,760
and what i mean by that is they were

381
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
looking for instances of mobile iron

382
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,160
running they were looking for instances

383
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
of telerik running now if you remember

384
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
when i was talking about the copy paste

385
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,920
report the australian government

386
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
actually outlined a series of

387
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
technologies that the client was uh not

388
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,839
the client the threat actors were

389
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,680
targeting and prior to them actually

390
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,480
breaching this organization we saw a lot

391
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,160
of instances of them you know looking

392
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,199
for telerik and looking for mobile iron

393
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,519
now what's interesting with this case

394
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,440
with the mining sector and also with the

395
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,240
energy sector firstly i would say is the

396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,639
fact that you know there was a big shift

397
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,240
in sophistication

398
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
from what was done for initial

399
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,120
reconnaissance through to you know uh

400
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
initial exploitation it was less

401
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,199
sophisticated and then when they

402
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
actually landed on the server the types

403
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
of enumeration and defensive asian

404
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
techniques they used became more

405
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,880
sophisticated and it's actually been

406
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
hypothesized by several security

407
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,839
researchers that perhaps china has a

408
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,480
tier one that operates across various

409
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
apt groups and then hands over to you

410
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,040
know another tier and i say this because

411
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
there was a stark contrast in technical

412
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
skill

413
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,839
xi jinping's dream of china is one where

414
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,920
china's military power is

415
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,720
you know second to none and what that

416
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,160
means is the ability to deter the us

417
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,440
specifically if conflict is required

418
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,880
and currently

419
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,519
the people's liberation army has the

420
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
largest naval force in the world they

421
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
also have hypersonic missiles which

422
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
travel five times faster than the speed

423
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
of sound and they are the second largest

424
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
military spender in the world right

425
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,600
after the us

426
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
china also has an air force with

427
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
advanced equipment allegedly stolen from

428
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,320
us designs

429
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
now back in 2017 a defense contractor in

430
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,199
australia that was focused on aerospace

431
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,160
engineering experienced an incident and

432
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,000
this incident resulted in the

433
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
exfiltration of 30 gigabytes of

434
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,399
sensitive data that was under restricted

435
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,680
access

436
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
the data included information pertaining

437
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,440
to the

438
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
f-35 stealth fighter

439
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
which was actually recently featured on

440
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,839
the news i think a few days ago and this

441
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
was all stolen through the china chopper

442
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,240
webshell which is a notorious webshell

443
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
that chinese apt groups have used

444
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
throughout the years and i think like

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
notorious because it actually even

446
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
emerged in 2021 with the exchange breach

447
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,839
and you know then the attack is then

448
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,120
subsequently installing china chopper

449
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,800
and here you can see the uncanny

450
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
resemblance between the chinese tendul

451
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,680
j-20 aircraft and the american f-35 and

452
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,920
actually a few weeks ago this article

453
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,720
was released that china was potentially

454
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
you know gonna release a stealth

455
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,959
helicopter that resembles the u.s black

456
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,439
hawk but you know this is conjecture at

457
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,439
this point in time you know it's alleged

458
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
no actual images have surfaced but it'll

459
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,839
be interesting to keep an eye out on

460
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,439
that

461
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
as a part of you know china having a

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
very strong naval base they're very

463
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,799
focused on naval technology

464
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,359
and in 2018 there was a chinese

465
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,240
businessman that was allegedly tasked by

466
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
the chinese northwestern polytechnical

467
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
university to export u.s hydrophones to

468
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,000
chinese state-owned businesses and

469
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
hydrophones are devices that allow

470
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
underwater sound monitoring so you can

471
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,679
understand why this would be important

472
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,120
to the naval base

473
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,039
he was found guilty of supplying up to

474
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
60 hydrophones worth 100k

475
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,360
but he was you know allegedly

476
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,840
it was alleged that he stole over 8

477
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
million

478
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,480
and so as a part of this i guess thirst

479
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
for technology that brings me to the

480
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
third initiative that xi jinping has set

481
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,880
and this this initiative is called made

482
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,840
in china 2025.

483
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
the goal is for china to move from being

484
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
a world producer of cheaper low-tech

485
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,799
items to becoming a more technologically

486
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,799
intensive manufacturer

487
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
and so the goals of this initiative

488
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
include china ramping up their right

489
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
research and development spend

490
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
especially on tech

491
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
reducing tax rates on all the domestic

492
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
tech companies

493
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
approving mergers and acquisitions with

494
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,559
foreign tech companies and focusing on

495
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,039
areas like cyber security robotics

496
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,480
fintech you know biotechnology quantum

497
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
computing

498
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
the goal is for china to become a

499
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,799
technological powerhouse and by that

500
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,880
china sees the importance of

501
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,400
self-sufficiency

502
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,559
and what i mean by self-sufficiency is

503
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,720
not needing to rely on the supply chain

504
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,400
from other countries they want to be

505
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
able to control the supply chain all

506
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
domestically

507
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,080
and that kind of brings me to my next

508
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,280
point so china is actually outpacing the

509
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
rest of the world in 5g

510
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,520
because of you know huawei and also

511
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,840
electrical vehicle adoption

512
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
both rely on the use of semiconductors

513
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
and semiconductors are

514
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,799
i mean has been referred to as the crown

515
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
jewels of tech because it's a critical

516
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
enabler for new technologies for example

517
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
quantum computing uh you know fintech

518
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,960
space etc and what's interesting is

519
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679
leadership in the semiconductor industry

520
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,240
would actually allow will help china

521
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,200
geopolitically because currently taiwan

522
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
and the us dominate the supply chain for

523
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,960
semiconductors and semiconductors i'll

524
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,760
just note are also critical in military

525
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
has military advantages because it's

526
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
used in national security systems

527
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
as a part of this china has actually

528
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,720
accepted all domestic semiconductor

529
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,679
companies from tax for 10 years and

530
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,840
china has also you know raised billions

531
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,880
of dollars in their national

532
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,799
semiconductor fund

533
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,000
the reason why they're focusing on

534
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,480
semiconductor links back to made in

535
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,640
china 2025 where they want to be

536
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
technologically self-sufficient and if

537
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,240
the supply chain is stopped or disrupted

538
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,679
by taiwan or you know us that greatly

539
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,159
hamstrings china's ability to evolve in

540
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,480
the tech space

541
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
in 2021 i worked a case where this

542
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
client was a big tech company they were

543
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,799
one of the

544
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
i guess world pioneers of this

545
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,280
technology in their respective sector

546
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,200
and during this time a lot of

547
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
interesting things happened the dwell

548
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,679
time that we witnessed was around four

549
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,559
months

550
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
on top of this the threat actors started

551
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,280
to use dll search order hijacking to

552
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,760
install cobalt strike in enterprise

553
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
application directories

554
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
the thread actors also performed

555
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
credential dumping through manually

556
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
dumping out elsas which

557
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,039
you know i've already referenced twice

558
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,600
in the previous two cases

559
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,840
the threat actors were focused on

560
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,440
exfiltration and that seemed to be the

561
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,320
goal

562
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,799
they were iterating through file servers

563
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,520
and share drives globally through this

564
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
company looking for documents pertaining

565
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,480
to research and development innovation

566
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,720
patents technology you know you get the

567
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,520
gist of this the style that the files

568
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,159
that they were looking for and once the

569
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,200
client

570
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
realized that the threat actors were in

571
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,400
their environment

572
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
you know most clients tend to kind of

573
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,640
react very quickly and start to shut

574
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,960
down servers etc but that alerted the

575
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
threat actors and resulted in a series

576
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,280
of punishing activities like the threat

577
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,120
actors started to lock people out of

578
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,280
their accounts by changing credentials

579
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
and the threat actors also started to

580
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
enable hundreds of disabled user

581
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,039
accounts

582
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,600
now as per the copy paste report we did

583
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,320
see dll search order hijacking used to

584
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
install cobalt strike uh is my screen

585
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
loading

586
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
or is it just me that it's looking kind

587
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
of glitched

588
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
no it's glitchy

589
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,840
okay so

590
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,000
let me go back is that better

591
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
yeah it looks better now

592
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
okay perfect so as per the copy paste

593
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,400
report we saw dll search order hijacking

594
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
used to install cobalt strike i've

595
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
redacted this a bit so

596
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
uh i'm just gonna verbally talk you

597
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,799
through it basically what happened was

598
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,679
the attackers used remote wmi to execute

599
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,000
cobalt strike and they installed it in

600
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
you know application directories that

601
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,000
were specific to the organization and

602
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,919
then on top of this they started to

603
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,679
execute the dll through msfield.exe and

604
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,880
proceeded to run the dll in memory so

605
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
now once cobalt strike is running in

606
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,120
memory the thread actors then removed

607
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
the dll

608
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
and that obviously was a form of defense

609
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
evasion and this technique was

610
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
referenced in the australian copy paste

611
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
report

612
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,799
in the same year i actually worked

613
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,640
another case where one of our nursing

614
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,960
home clients were also experiencing an

615
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,039
alleged bronze mohawk attack

616
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,120
now this client actually received an

617
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,520
alert from a trusted third party and

618
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
once we jumped in to do the ir we had

619
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,799
found around five ips pertaining to

620
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,960
alleged bronze mohawk and what happened

621
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
was the attackers

622
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,960
were using nuclei to perform enumeration

623
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,799
of the external perimeter

624
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,640
then the attackers realized you know

625
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,320
once they started like going through

626
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,799
telerik mobile iron this client was

627
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,880
unfortunately running mobile iron so

628
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,440
they zoned in on the mobile ion server

629
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,919
exploited the vulnerability and used

630
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,640
that to install jsp web shells and i've

631
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
got a screenshot of the webshell there

632
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,960
and they installed several jsp web

633
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
shells by injecting it to the start of

634
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,640
legitimate web pages

635
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
they then proceeded to enumerate

636
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,679
credentials

637
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
they iterated through the web logs

638
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
looking for lines in the logs that

639
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,400
showed the attack ip they proceeded to

640
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,799
delete those logs and then installed

641
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,559
tsunamibot

642
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,320
now at this point if you think that this

643
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,240
is strange i'm with you it does seem

644
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
strange but we'll talk about that in a

645
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
second so i've got a screenshot here of

646
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,919
the command they used to run the jsp web

647
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,000
shell and the command that they used to

648
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
remotely install tsunami bot from a

649
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,679
remote server

650
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,919
and so i say this is interesting because

651
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,760
back to the energy case where the client

652
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,640
was running you know uh had ips

653
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,080
attacking them from compromised

654
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
microtech routers we hypothesized that

655
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
this attack was likely for the purpose

656
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,679
of infrastructure building

657
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,720
now in order for china to become a world

658
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,279
economic leader it needs to rely on the

659
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,159
youth and that is where this comes in

660
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,240
as of

661
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,039
2021

662
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,279
china is bringing something into the

663
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,120
school curriculum from primary through

664
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,080
to university called xi jinping thought

665
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,640
and this is a thought curriculum that

666
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,279
teaches the youth

667
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,559
it's strange using the word youth that

668
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,400
makes me feel old but it's to teach the

669
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,120
youth the importance of nationalistic

670
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,240
pride and to also instill in them this

671
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,799
sense of national responsibility and a

672
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,120
call to arms for these kids to innovate

673
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,279
coincidentally this aligns with china's

674
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,880
goals of becoming you know a

675
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
technological superpower

676
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,679
and so you can see that the role of

677
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,320
education is critical in the achievement

678
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,600
of the chinese dream because in 2021

679
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
georgetown cset division actually

680
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
published a brilliant report and this

681
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,320
report highlighted the like the link

682
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,400
between state-funded chinese

683
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
universities six of them and how they

684
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
were linked to six apt groups the first

685
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,440
one on the list ain't n university you

686
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
can see there it's linked to apt40

687
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
aka bronze mohawk

688
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
i've also got screenshots of various

689
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
professors from these universities in

690
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,520
particular professor gujen from hainan

691
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,400
university was said that he would post a

692
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,120
lot of job listings on student boards

693
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,200
and host hacking competitions and

694
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
specifically look for students to quote

695
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,240
solve problems and these problems were

696
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
also always referring to some kind of

697
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,159
hacking problem or a technical issue but

698
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,279
he would offer prize money of up to 74

699
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,679
000 usd which is an incredible amount of

700
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,360
money to just be throwing around at

701
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,559
problems

702
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,120
but as a part of china's science of

703
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,880
strategy

704
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,679
china's science of military strategy

705
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,440
universities are actually

706
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
a key vessel in how china maintains

707
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,840
their cyber security influence the

708
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
university's role is to

709
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
foster foster you know cyber talent

710
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,520
develop new tactics and methods that can

711
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,760
then be leveraged in the future in cyber

712
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,159
attacks and this kind of shortens the

713
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,960
length of time needed to turn academic

714
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
research into operational cyber

715
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,640
capabilities

716
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
now you'll also see in this list that

717
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,919
all six of these universities partake in

718
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,799
creating courses cyber security courses

719
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,600
that align with ai and machine learning

720
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,840
china is heavily investing in ai and

721
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
machine learning pertaining to the

722
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,039
research in cyberspace

723
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,120
now in terms of takeaways for my

724
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,679
presentation the first one i want to

725
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,440
highlight is the impact that

726
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
presidential terms and checks and

727
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
balances has

728
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,559
what i mean by that is in western

729
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,600
politics like australia and us in

730
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,760
australia the prime minister only has a

731
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
term for four years

732
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
china is in a very unique position where

733
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,080
xi jinping isn't held back by that and

734
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
that enables him to think about the

735
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
strategies for china 20 to 30 years in

736
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,720
the future

737
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,279
hence why made in china oh sorry hence

738
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,279
why the chinese dream

739
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
was created in 2012 and has spanned the

740
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,760
entire length of his term up to date

741
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
the second point is that

742
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
china moves very fast and has an

743
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
incredible agility in politics and that

744
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,399
has led to a rapid you know rapid growth

745
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,480
in their technological sector

746
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
and a part of that is the lack of checks

747
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
and balances so xi jinping's able to

748
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,039
instill policies

749
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,200
and in western politics that wouldn't be

750
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,440
the case because there's opposing

751
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,880
parties that would question those

752
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,360
policies and debate them

753
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,799
as a part of this that links into my

754
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,919
second point

755
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,679
because of this rapid technological

756
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,240
growth china's cyber capability is only

757
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,640
elementary compared to what it can be

758
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,279
and i say this because you know china is

759
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
heavily investing in these areas as

760
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,840
you've seen it's a part of their overall

761
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,480
geopolitical strategy

762
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
the third point is that threat

763
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
intelligence especially when it comes to

764
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
nation-state threat groups is very

765
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,720
linked to the geopolitical goals from

766
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
that country and also the geopolitical

767
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,760
relationships between each country

768
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,799
and i hope that through this

769
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
presentation you're able to see some of

770
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,279
the linkages that i was you know subtly

771
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,480
trying to push

772
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,159
between what was happening in the

773
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,399
decline of the australian and chinese

774
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
relationship to some of the cyber

775
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,399
attacks that i've referenced

776
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,720
the last point i want to raise is the

777
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,320
importance of being more proactive

778
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,919
versus reactive

779
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,320
you know in the past a lot of you know

780
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
incident response people kind of respond

781
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,279
or only talk about what's happening

782
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,360
after an attack happens

783
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
given that we know that china has a

784
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
specific policy that links universities

785
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,240
to these cyber security groups and has a

786
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
specific program for them to generate

787
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,240
research in machine learning and the

788
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,200
applications of that in cyber security

789
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
i think it would be very wise for you

790
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
know us to pay attention to some of the

791
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
research being funded and pushed out

792
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
because it'll only be a matter of time

793
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
before the research makes the jump from

794
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,480
theory into practice

795
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,000
and with that thank you guys so much for

796
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,760
listening i really appreciate your time

797
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,520
and you can always stay in touch with me

798
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,679
on twitter
