1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
well intelligence field and I think what

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,340
you're going to hear from her is going

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,490
to be a little enlightening for you in

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,250
terms of how we address uncertainty and

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,820
how we think about things that are not

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,820
necessarily as specific as this is the

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,920
exploit the adversary used things that

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,570
are a little bit more abstract if you

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,670
will and I know she didn't want me to

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:33,840
use that word but I did anyway so ladies

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:35,700
and gentlemen Ruth desire hi everyone

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,290
I'm glad you stuck around I know being

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,750
the last two presentations a day we're

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,890
only getting it about half the audience

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,690
my name is Ruth Cuddyer I am a

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,309
traditional intelligence analyst I've

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,930
been working in the cyber realm for a

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,000
couple of years now but before that I

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,239
spent about ten years focused on the

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,180
Middle East and so that that's my

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,379
background there were some key ideas in

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,850
the first day that I really want to

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,890
recap before we get into this

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,050
presentation because these key ideas are

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,219
really important to understanding the

26
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,099
tradecraft that we're going to talk

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,090
about later on so blind spots there were

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,919
a number of people who talked about

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,409
blind spots and understanding the blind

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,840
spots or the gaps in your data what

31
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,000
those blind spots are and how to account

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,369
for them or compensate for them but also

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,409
context context is key and without

34
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,450
context intelligence has little to no

35
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,540
value and then on top of that

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,950
assumptions and conclusion so don't make

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,659
assumptions and don't jump to

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,240
conclusions those were two very key

39
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,890
ideas from yesterday and then there are

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,380
two key quotes from yesterday as well

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,820
Rick Collins said clearly it's not black

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,979
and white there's a lot of gray in our

43
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,508
space and I think one of the challenges

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:44,970
is to convey the gray content in a way

45
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,729
that is clearly gray and not either

46
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,048
black or white and then Michael will

47
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,950
burn said I don't think that word means

48
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,479
what you think it means and I want you

49
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,700
to keep that in mind anytime you're

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,500
reading an intelligence product because

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,240
there's a lot of intelligence products

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,960
that use words in ways they were never

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
meant to be used

54
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,119
okay so I'm going to talk to you about

55
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,610
how to apply traditional tradecraft to

56
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,650
the cyber intelligence world and there

57
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,230
were a lot of talks yesterday about how

58
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,970
do you find quality intelligence and how

59
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,130
do you figure out is this intelligence

60
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,739
relevant for me and so this talk is

61
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,420
going to give you the skills to go

62
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,950
through the intelligence and decide if

63
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,690
it's relevant to you and decide if it's

64
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,488
quality it's also going to give you the

65
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,319
skills to produce quality intelligence

66
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,720
if that's something that you do so the

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,510
last presentation Kyle and Scott talked

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
a lot about three types of reports they

69
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,290
got to the very end and they talked

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,819
about the RFI the short report and the

71
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,048
long report and so this is going to give

72
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,910
you some skills for when you read those

73
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,430
reports how do you figure out if the

74
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:52,930
analysis was good or if the analysis has

75
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:56,049
some holes in it so Colin Powell had

76
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,640
three rules for his intelligence team he

77
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,930
said tell me what you know tell me what

78
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,458
you don't know tell me what you think

79
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,769
and make sure you always tell me which

80
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,180
is which so tell me what you know is

81
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,340
your data this is these are the things

82
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,109
that you can you have you have logs for

83
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,730
you have data for tell me what you don't

84
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,620
know are your gaps or your blind spots

85
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,048
and then tell me what you think is your

86
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,700
assessment or your analysis and you have

87
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,829
to you have to make sure that you're not

88
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,839
feeling embarrassed or trying to hide

89
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,000
things you don't know the fact that you

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,290
don't know something isn't bad it's not

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,880
something to be ashamed of it's not

92
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,750
something to hide and trying to hide it

93
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,370
will only make your assessment worse so

94
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,170
what's the difference between data and

95
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,980
assessment I think someone talked about

96
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,048
the difference between data and

97
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,459
intelligence earlier I want to go into a

98
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,410
little bit more detail about the

99
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,260
difference between them data is black

100
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,170
and white assessment is gray assessment

101
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,030
is very fuzzy and data is precise and so

102
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,679
you never want to confuse the two when

103
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,910
you're talking to when you're writing a

104
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,220
report or when you're reading a report

105
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,840
if you can't figure out what is data and

106
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,209
what is assessment in a report that's a

107
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,079
sign that the report has issues so

108
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,669
traditional intelligence deals with

109
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,590
their blind spots in certain ways here's

110
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,940
some examples of blind spots from World

111
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,840
War two sorry the last slide was

112
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,380
supposed to have been hidden but

113
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,880
whatever so I'm going to use World War

114
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,138
two as an example because this is when

115
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,209
traditional intelligence really

116
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,560
formalized their trade craft and when

117
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,209
most of the intelligence disciplines

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,339
came into being in the

119
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,139
form that they are today so there were a

120
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,690
lot of radio intercepts in World War two

121
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,039
and the radio intercepts were fantastic

122
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,419
intelligence you could tell what people

123
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,818
orders people were giving to their

124
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,740
various units around Europe the problem

125
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:31,120
was you couldn't tell what orders were

126
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,819
being passed through means other than

127
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,919
signals you also couldn't tell what was

128
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,710
being sent over encrypted channels and

129
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,000
you couldn't tell what was Miss

130
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,169
direction if they were sending orders

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
over the radio that were clearly

132
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,669
intended to not be followed you had no

133
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,470
idea and then aerial imagery was

134
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,049
fantastic aerial imagery came into its

135
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,060
own in World War two but aerial imagery

136
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,620
only shows you what's on the ground at

137
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,599
the time of the image so if you take

138
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,889
your image at eleven o'clock and all the

139
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,690
interesting activity happens at two

140
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,370
o'clock your aerial imagery is

141
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,410
completely useless and you'll never see

142
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,349
that activity because it's a blind spot

143
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,449
for aerial imagery informants and spies

144
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,849
are very useful in World War two made

145
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:12,460
great use of this type of intelligence

146
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:14,469
collection but if all of the interesting

147
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,870
activity is happening in department a of

148
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,880
the enemy command and all of your spies

149
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,159
are in departments see you're still

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,539
blind you have fantastic intelligence on

151
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,770
what department c is doing but

152
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,169
department see isn't where the

153
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,000
intelligence is and so that's a blind

154
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,500
spot and then there's a lot of media and

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,110
propaganda that took place in World War

156
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,240
two and this a lot of this media was

157
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,250
actually created intentionally to

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,800
mislead the adversary rather than to

159
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,940
inform the public and so these are the

160
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,940
blind spots within traditional

161
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,159
intelligence and you can take that

162
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,430
through to the next 70 or 80 years and

163
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,930
as the intelligence services truck what

164
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,509
he called disciplines became more

165
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,130
sophisticated they've worked out ways

166
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:59,229
around most of these blind spots but

167
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,690
they still exist today so these are some

168
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:04,690
of my favorite examples from World War

169
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,710
two we have the Enigma machine which at

170
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,330
the beginning of the war it was

171
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,430
Germany's advantage because the Allies

172
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,500
couldn't read what Germany was saying to

173
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,580
their de férias units and outposts but

174
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,050
by the end of the war it was to the

175
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,280
Allied advantage because the Allies

176
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,469
could read all the intercepts but the

177
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,619
Germans didn't know it so that that's an

178
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:24,250
example of a blind spot on both sides on

179
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,960
the ID the tank on the bottom is a decoy

180
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,099
it's inflatable that's why four people

181
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,448
are holding it up off the ground with

182
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:31,370
their pinkies so

183
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,219
there were a number of these decoys used

184
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,199
in North England to convince the Germans

185
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,689
that operation d-day would happen in the

186
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,849
North rather than in the south and it

187
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,110
was very successful Hitler totally

188
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,748
believed it and it's one of the reasons

189
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,150
d-day was successful it totally spooked

190
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:49,520
the aerial imagery and the human human

191
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,370
performance and then this ID card is my

192
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,049
favorite one this is operation mincemeat

193
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,960
the body of a dead homeless man in

194
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,870
England was given a fake identity

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,229
complete with everything his his fake

196
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,449
identity had a house a family a

197
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,580
girlfriend like the whole everything you

198
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,680
could imagine they put it all in this

199
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,330
they made him into I think a naval petty

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,749
officer or maybe a command or something

201
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,188
like that gave him a uniform put all of

202
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:18,259
his pocket litter and all that good

203
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,689
stuff on him and dropped his body off

204
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:24,499
the coast of Italy with a bunch of fake

205
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:27,050
documents to convince the axis that

206
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:28,099
England was planning on I think was

207
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,110
something with their operations of the

208
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,849
Mediterranean those documents made it

209
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,830
all the way to Hitler's desk they were

210
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:36,199
completely fake and nothing about any of

211
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,508
the information was true Hitler totally

212
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,580
believed it and it absolutely gave the

213
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,229
Allies an advantage so these are some

214
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,409
very serious blind spots within

215
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,729
traditional intelligence and traditional

216
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:50,719
intelligence is aware of these blind

217
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,740
spots so the way to deal with these

218
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:54,529
blind spots within traditional

219
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,939
tradecraft is to use multiple

220
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:57,830
intelligence sources so if you can get

221
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:59,719
signals and imagery of something you've

222
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,300
got a lot fewer blind spots because they

223
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:04,550
don't have the same uncertainties and if

224
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,959
you can't do multi intelligence you can

225
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,180
do multisource so you can get different

226
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,610
types of images of the same thing for

227
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,839
different images from different days

228
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,939
different times of day things like that

229
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,409
and then the other thing is to call out

230
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,749
the sources and the level of uncertainty

231
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:19,099
because if people understand what your

232
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:20,599
level of uncertainty is then they know

233
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,089
if they should take this data seriously

234
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,469
or not seriously and when they aggregate

235
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,599
the data they can aggregate the

236
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:28,219
uncertainty to figure out is this good

237
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,709
intelligence or bad intelligence and

238
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,318
that's important because bad analysis is

239
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:37,578
bad defense is bad policy and is very

240
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:39,380
bad press so on the network side you can

241
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:40,589
avoid blind spots by multi sourcing with

242
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,600
like host and networking

243
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,330
nation or collaborating with various

244
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,000
different companies to gather more

245
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,940
information on what's going on around

246
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,190
you cyber intelligence is the newest int

247
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,810
and as Rick Holland said yesterday we're

248
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,310
still figuring out our tradecraft we

249
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,890
still don't know exactly how we want to

250
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,750
do things so something that's really

251
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,640
important for us to understand is Cyber

252
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,980
Intelligence combines many types of

253
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,230
intelligence into cyber and then says

254
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,940
okay look it's multi int but that's not

255
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,100
actually the case so we have to be

256
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,280
careful with that because cyber

257
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,140
intelligence has blind spots cyber that

258
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,329
the technical analysis the data can tell

259
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,980
you when the incident happened it can

260
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,480
tell you what the incident was it can

261
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,850
tell you how they accomplished the

262
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,690
incident but it can only tell you where

263
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,130
the incident hit your network from so

264
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,780
where did the incident originate from

265
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,490
you may or may not be able to tell

266
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,550
depending on what type of incident this

267
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,250
is there's a lot of uncertainty around

268
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,079
who who did the incident how do you know

269
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,220
who is behind the keyboard you're

270
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,750
probably not going to know who is behind

271
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,140
the keyboard unless you capture the

272
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,490
webcam on while their hands on keyboard

273
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,199
but you might know what usernames or

274
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,550
email addresses were involved in the

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,880
incident so there's uncertainty around

276
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,400
that that part of the the data why they

277
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,689
did this that's a really difficult one

278
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,350
to answer and I'll go into that on the

279
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,820
next slide where sometimes where is very

280
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,190
uncertain because if there's multiple

281
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,580
hot points if there's a lot of spoofing

282
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,270
going on the origination of the incident

283
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,910
could be impossible to find with your

284
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,790
data available and then when if the

285
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,650
recon started off your network there's a

286
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,910
lot of social media that goes on in

287
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:26,040
terms of apt using social media to start

288
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,069
their recon before they hit your network

289
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,930
so if all the recon on this incident

290
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,610
happens off your network you have no

291
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,500
idea when they first started targeting

292
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,850
you and that's an important piece of

293
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,560
information because if you know when

294
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,670
they first started targeting you you

295
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,579
might be able to figure out what

296
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,930
triggered them to look at you and so

297
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,120
this is another source of uncertainty

298
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,510
that we can't tell with the data we have

299
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,370
available intent is the ultimate source

300
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,220
of uncertainty you can never actually

301
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,040
know for sure what is going on in the my

302
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,470
another person anyone who says they know

303
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,269
exactly why this happened is selling

304
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:05,240
something there's absolutely there's

305
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,259
absolutely no way to know for sure

306
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,850
anybody who says that this is why

307
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,490
something happened should qualify that

308
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,470
statement in order for you to understand

309
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,740
how much data they have to back that

310
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,509
statement up so it's possible to make

311
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,949
guesses that why they someone did this

312
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:21,810
it's possible to make very educated

313
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,370
guesses but you can't ever make a

314
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,089
declarative statement about why

315
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:29,639
something happened so managing

316
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:31,170
uncertainty is is the whole point of of

317
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,550
this presentation so you've got

318
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,410
uncertainty in your data you've got

319
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,479
uncertainty in your analysis and your

320
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,649
final product has this overall level of

321
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,209
uncertainty and the purpose of of

322
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:45,629
managing your uncertainty is to tell the

323
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:48,540
reader in the product how much you don't

324
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:52,740
know and how much uncertainty you have

325
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,910
eliminated so that's a lot of talking

326
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,339
about things you don't know and can't

327
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,250
quantify but it's really important to do

328
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,170
so that the reader can assess how much

329
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,730
confidence they should put in their

330
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,469
final assessment that you give them in

331
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,870
this report and when you're reading a

332
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,480
report you should be looking for this

333
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,610
type of information to tell you how much

334
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,069
confidence you should have in the final

335
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,800
conclusion and this is all managed

336
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:20,099
through clear communication specifically

337
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,599
estimate of words so these are my

338
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,670
favorite estimate of words these are

339
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,620
very intelligence community centric

340
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,110
estimate of words but as you'll see in

341
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,329
some of my examples these are not the

342
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,819
only estimate of words out there i sat

343
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,769
down with Mike a few months ago to start

344
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,300
thinking about this presentation in

345
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,490
about 20 minutes i came up with more

346
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,529
than a hundred estimate of words and

347
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,660
that was just a quick off the top of my

348
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,720
head guess so there's a lot of different

349
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,199
ways to talk about uncertainty these are

350
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,209
some very very easy to find ones the

351
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,219
first group talks about how solid is

352
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,809
your data and the second group talks

353
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,029
about how sure are you that your

354
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:58,350
analysis is correct and there's a lot

355
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:03,360
more groups out there and there's a lot

356
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:05,100
of ways to discuss this so this is a bit

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,570
more definition in terms of the the

358
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,580
content

359
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,620
words high medium and low and Mike's

360
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,500
going to go into more about this and his

361
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,850
presentation coming up next so high

362
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,680
confidence you're really pretty sure

363
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,810
this is the one medium confidence your

364
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,120
5050 could go either way and low

365
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:25,459
confidence pretty much anything could

366
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,440
knock you off this this theory so if we

367
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,210
put them all together I could say that I

368
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,820
assess with low confidence that Dory

369
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,770
from Finding Nemo was possibly only

370
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,780
pretending to have memory loss in order

371
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:41,630
to spend more time with Nemo's father

372
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:43,640
marlin and you would understand that I'm

373
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,470
not very sure about this theory and I

374
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,390
give it a 50-50 shot that this is the

375
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,660
from the movie I have evidence for any

376
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:52,430
of this idea in the first place and so

377
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,959
this these are some examples I've tried

378
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,560
to color code them so you can kind of

379
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,910
get an idea I really like the top one as

380
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,160
well i assessed with high confidence

381
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,130
that unconfirmed reports of UFOs will

382
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,930
happen next month these things happen

383
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,430
every month so i can pretty be pretty

384
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,969
confident that it's going to happen and

385
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,229
the reports are always unconfirmed oh

386
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,500
that's that's a pretty easy statement to

387
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,940
make and this is this is very

388
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,300
traditional tradecraft format in terms

389
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,580
of the the wording and the structure and

390
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,579
you don't have to stick to this format

391
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,830
and my examples are not in this format

392
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:32,000
this is just i found some really funny

393
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:34,700
things to say so i said them so when

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,140
should you use estimate of language when

395
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,820
you're talking about your data you

396
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,280
should rarely use estimate of language

397
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,870
instead you should cite your data you

398
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,760
should be able to make fairly objective

399
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,470
statements about your data and so you

400
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,660
should just make the statement and cite

401
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,310
your data but you should always use

402
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,420
estimate of language when you're talking

403
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:55,849
about your assessment so i have log data

404
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,400
that says this site your data i think

405
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,180
that log data means that the adversary

406
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,680
did X on my network that's an assessment

407
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,640
it should have estimate of language on

408
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,530
around it and so anytime you're talking

409
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,140
about what your data means or why you

410
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,939
think your data does or doesn't mean

411
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,770
something you should be using estimate

412
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,279
of language to tell your reader how sure

413
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,529
you are and how much data you have to

414
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,329
back up your conclusion and Mike will go

415
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:26,050
into how to figure out how much data you

416
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:28,949
have in the next presentation so in real

417
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,779
life we have our intelligence rules and

418
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:34,569
we're reading this report and we're

419
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:38,470
looking for words that disguise poor

420
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:41,529
analysis we're looking for non sequitur

421
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,420
statements random statements of fact

422
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,850
that don't fit with anything else in the

423
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,069
paragraphs before after we're looking

424
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,809
for the echo chamber effect this is when

425
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:53,589
someone puts out a very poorly

426
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:55,629
researched and supported report a couple

427
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,249
other people produce them spin-off

428
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:59,559
reports from that now all of a sudden

429
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:01,089
you've got a whole lot of reports that

430
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,290
hide the flaws in the original source

431
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,999
and you're like oh man there's a lot of

432
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,199
people talking about this the last

433
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:07,240
person to talk about it is pretty

434
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,490
reputable I'm guessing this is a good

435
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,899
theory and it totally hides the flaws in

436
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,439
the original report so that's a very

437
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:17,050
important one to look out for and the

438
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:20,139
uncertainty should shrink when you're

439
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,790
reading a report not grow so this is

440
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,019
this is really important this is the key

441
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,670
takeaway when you get to the end of

442
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,680
report if you have more questions and

443
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,660
answers if you have more questions than

444
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,628
when you started it's probably not a

445
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,579
good report and so this is why LM cert

446
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:37,149
we don't actually have any automated

447
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:41,170
external intelligence feeds we only have

448
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:43,240
automated external data feeds because we

449
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,279
don't want our intelligence to go

450
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,139
automatically into the system we want to

451
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,110
look at it and decide is this valuable

452
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:52,689
or not is this well sourced is this

453
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,430
analysis done properly am I putting

454
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:56,680
garbage into my system or am I putting

455
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,420
good intelligence into my system and so

456
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,829
that's the from thing that we when we're

457
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,389
reading reports we're looking for these

458
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:03,638
things and we're looking for the good

459
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:07,030
solid analysis before we take the

460
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,970
indicators and do anything with them so

461
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,648
here's my example my first example this

462
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,449
is a report on sands casino that came

463
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:16,059
out in Bloomberg in I once the early

464
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,760
janiel early December last year and so

465
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:22,780
fantastic reports quite lengthy and it

466
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:26,079
talks about unconfirmed anonymous

467
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,960
reports that Iran was behind the sands

468
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,879
casino data destruction attack and so

469
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,950
the statement goes other countries have

470
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,929
spied on American companies and they

471
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,809
have stolen from them but this is likely

472
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,130
the first time occurring months before

473
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,200
the late November attack on Sony

474
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,130
Pictures Entertainment that a foreign

475
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,860
player simply sought to destroy American

476
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,320
corporate infrastructure on such a scale

477
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,928
so I've underlined the estimate of words

478
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,980
but there's also a lot of qualification

479
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:59,890
in there they qualify the foreign player

480
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,049
meaning it's not a criminal action they

481
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,669
qualify American corporate

482
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,100
infrastructure and they qualify the

483
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:07,750
scale and they qualify the timeline so

484
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,129
there's a lot of information in here

485
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,080
that they're they're very clearly

486
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,820
delineating this statement can't be

487
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,918
confused with a bunch of other more

488
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,360
generalized statements but they're also

489
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,580
telling you they don't know for sure

490
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,780
because it's very possible that this

491
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,879
could have happened before and got

492
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,770
completely covered up it's also

493
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,320
completely possible that this isn't Iran

494
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,240
because they don't have any officials at

495
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,559
sands casino and they don't have any

496
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,210
officials in the US government to

497
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,460
confirm that so they're not going

498
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,280
completely based off of these anonymous

499
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,250
reports that don't want to be named and

500
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,010
that that's not enough certainty to

501
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,510
confirm in this report the estimate of

502
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,390
language provides the reader with an

503
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,740
assessment of how solid the statement is

504
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,059
so if you read the statement and you

505
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,460
come away a hundred percent convinced

506
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:53,889
that Iran did it you need to read it

507
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,390
again but if you read the statement and

508
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,039
you come away convinced that Iran

509
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,450
probably did this and it's probably a

510
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,330
big deal but it's not the end of the

511
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:05,970
world then you're probably reading it

512
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:09,699
about right so this is my other example

513
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,110
i read the operation cleaver report i

514
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,039
was really excited i was really hoping i

515
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,520
was going to get a lot of good things

516
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:18,390
out of it unfortunately there were some

517
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,710
analytical issues with the report and so

518
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,960
their connection their connecting the

519
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,049
operation cleaver activity to the IRGC

520
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,809
was a major concern of mine they don't

521
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:31,240
provide any data in the beginning they

522
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:35,139
present the IRGC logo on a page with no

523
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,480
connection to the text like 45 pages

524
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:42,100
later they say in the conclusion that

525
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,320
IRGC conducts malicious activity out of

526
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,418
on but they don't tie the IRGC to any of

527
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,610
the activity in the report and then

528
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:51,549
after that like 15 pages later it's a

529
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,949
very long report they state that the

530
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:56,139
IRGC logo inspired the operation cleaver

531
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,120
logo because of the close connection

532
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,309
between the operation cleaver activity

533
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,539
in the IRGC well I'm at the end of the

534
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:05,110
report and I haven't seen any

535
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:06,850
indications of this so I have to wonder

536
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,879
are they making it up or are they hiding

537
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,980
their data but I also have to wonder how

538
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,320
did like how confident are they because

539
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,909
they didn't tell me at no point in time

540
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,770
did they throw this in there speculation

541
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:19,659
page they didn't throw this in their

542
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,400
assumptions page they didn't put any

543
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:24,760
estimate of language around this I have

544
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,080
no idea I don't think the IRGC is

545
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,549
connected to this activity simply

546
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,639
because of the way they documented it in

547
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:32,200
the report if they had more of more firm

548
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,179
connection they probably would have told

549
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,820
me in the report somewhere so this is an

550
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:45,370
example of analytical tradecraft done

551
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,870
wrong there's other there's other

552
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,299
examples from the port that I can talk

553
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:53,289
about later if anybody's interested I

554
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:56,110
have a whole soapbox on that thing so in

555
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,760
conclusion you should clearly mark the

556
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,760
unknowns in your data and talk about the

557
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,650
level of uncertainty you should not make

558
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,059
analytical leaps or jump to conclusions

559
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,460
as has been stated earlier in this

560
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,649
conference and the payoff is higher

561
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,530
quality of Intel and better defended

562
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,850
networks so i can take questions and/or

563
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,370
have discussion questions whichever

564
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,969
people would prefer so questions plenty

565
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,969
of questions good

566
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,320
how do you how do you balance a

567
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,889
well-polished report with the amount of

568
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,168
time that you have to put it out so you

569
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:38,779
have raw data that with some indicators

570
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:41,659
but is you have maybe low or medium

571
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:44,330
uncertainty but you don't want to also

572
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:45,740
put out a report that's not going to be

573
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:51,289
taken seriously because you don't have

574
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:53,360
all the facts yet so I think I think

575
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,100
this is a really hard thing to balance

576
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,899
you have to look at the goals of your

577
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,459
organization and the goals of

578
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,709
publication what are you trying to gain

579
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,240
out of publicizing this data if you're

580
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,279
publicizing it if you're publishing it

581
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,630
internally then you want to put all of

582
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,620
your confidence language in there and

583
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,049
you want to say this is really

584
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,850
preliminary we don't know if you're

585
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,889
doing collaboration with other cut with

586
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,299
other companies in your industry you

587
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:15,559
again want to put it out with all of

588
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,299
your confidence language and say this is

589
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,879
really preliminary we're hoping other

590
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:22,789
people can fill in the blanks and if

591
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,679
you're publishing it on a blog you

592
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:26,960
probably don't have enough to publish or

593
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,700
you have to publish it as this is really

594
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,860
preliminary we're hoping other readers

595
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,899
or other analysts can fill in the blanks

596
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,129
or this is our preliminary look at it

597
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:37,389
we're going to come out with a more

598
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:41,360
solid report in the next weeks or months

599
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:44,029
if you put out uncertain analysis as a

600
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,309
confident statement that this is what is

601
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:49,279
you're going to look even worse if you

602
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:51,470
have to go back and change it later so

603
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,389
it's better to to be clear up front with

604
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,269
how confident you are and how much you

605
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:58,100
can actually prove I talk to people all

606
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:59,090
the time I'm like hey i saw this random

607
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,389
indicator i thought it was really

608
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,649
interesting i have no idea what it means

609
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:05,269
and because i'm really upfront with that

610
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,199
when they figure out what means they'll

611
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:12,380
come back and tell me now I just

612
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:14,720
collected intelligence so that's a kind

613
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,010
of a useful if you're really up front

614
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,309
with how much you do and don't know

615
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,110
you're more likely to be taken seriously

616
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:23,809
and adding in some confidence words

617
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,370
doesn't take that much extra time you

618
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,990
know let it sit for an hour go back and

619
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,699
reread it and add in some probable

620
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:35,320
possible likely less likely

621
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:39,340
and then ship it off so that's that's

622
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,500
really what we we do a lot of so how do

623
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,740
you stink distinguish between estimated

624
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,740
words and weasel words um that's a

625
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:51,280
really good question mostly I look for

626
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:53,110
is the estimate when I finish reading

627
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,399
this paragraph or this report do I have

628
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,889
more questions or to have fewer

629
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,390
questions if the estimate of words are

630
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:01,180
used correctly i should have fewer

631
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:03,340
questions if they are weasel words it

632
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,230
should look like someone trying to sell

633
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,689
me something or someone trying to get

634
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,400
out of answering a question and so it's

635
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,230
more a matter of it's a very subjective

636
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,360
analysis and you have to look at what is

637
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,520
the tone and what is the what is the

638
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,189
overall impression created by this

639
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,690
report if it looks like they're trying

640
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,690
to sell you something they probably are

641
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,740
yes I'm so did I understand correctly

642
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,590
you don't accept the intelligence coming

643
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,910
externally and if any of that does come

644
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,639
externally do you provide some

645
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:37,570
confidence rating to the specific

646
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,700
reporter so if when when LM cert when we

647
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,290
get external intelligence we review it

648
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,380
before we stick it into our system and

649
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,909
so our analysts look at it and say does

650
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,820
this match what we know does this make

651
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:52,210
sense is there giant gaping holes in the

652
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,129
analysis if it doesn't pass the smell

653
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,530
test then we just don't put it in our

654
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:00,340
system we don't really provide it with a

655
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:03,180
confidence rating but we like we just

656
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,179
don't stick it in our system

657
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,830
do you have any occurrence where you use

658
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:15,110
cover sheets that that state confidence

659
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:18,120
level reliability and applicability of

660
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,459
the report for internal reporting or

661
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,678
what happens when you get those because

662
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,590
different people have academic writing

663
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,990
styles passive writing styles things

664
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,000
like that and it's very difficult to

665
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,539
filter that out sometimes it's better

666
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,190
just upfront State so if we ever got

667
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:38,190
something with a cover sheet we would be

668
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:41,909
thrilled we generally account for the

669
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,960
writing style by well we have academic

670
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:47,539
writers in our team so we're used to

671
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,460
adjusting for that different style

672
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:51,809
communication style and if we got

673
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,059
something with cover sheet we would

674
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:55,590
probably up our confidence level in the

675
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,850
report is based on the fact that they

676
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,418
were giving us their assumptions up

677
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:02,969
front we don't create cover sheets but

678
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,039
we will sometimes provide an overview

679
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,299
for senior executives if they're hey

680
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,240
how's this report what do you think of

681
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:11,850
it that's it's not a very formal process

682
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,080
that we do it's it's more like this is

683
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:18,408
analysis go look at the report if that

684
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,408
makes sense

685
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,960
we do but we still don't automatically

686
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,760
feed their intelligence into our system

687
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,360
it's what oh I'm sorry the question was

688
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,220
it do we do we trust a source more

689
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,070
because of their history and they have a

690
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:54,150
history of of well source reports versus

691
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,830
bad reports any answers we do trust

692
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,890
certain sources more than others but

693
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:04,860
it's not it's not formalized and it's

694
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:13,040
not yeah it there's there's no structure

695
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:16,620
to it so that's how am i doing on time I

696
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,200
10 minutes all right can we go will this

697
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,479
work no can we go to the discussion

698
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,050
questions all right so I have a question

699
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,300
for you guys do you guys consider

700
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:29,370
indicator lists or IP list to be threat

701
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,060
intelligence and if so how do you judge

702
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:38,250
the quality of those do you judge it

703
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:40,110
based on the source based on the content

704
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,170
like if there's no context how do you

705
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,059
how do you how do you rate those we have

706
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:55,200
some questions in the back

707
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:57,210
I think that was the purpose of the

708
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,730
question I was asking earlier is we get

709
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,669
a lot of that straight black list we're

710
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:08,490
telling you it's bad trust us and they

711
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:10,409
put 888 inside of it so so what we do is

712
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:14,100
we we have two different ratings a

713
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:16,259
rating on the source how well we have

714
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,549
seen them report in the past and then a

715
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,340
rating on the information we're

716
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:23,249
receiving as to you know does it make

717
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,049
sense that the information in the

718
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:27,869
context that is given means something

719
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:31,110
straight straight list of ips no we

720
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:32,879
normally just throw away right and we

721
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,758
don't consider them to be intelligence

722
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:37,320
we consider them to be indicator lists

723
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:38,610
if they come from a source we trust will

724
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,039
kind of scan through them and see if

725
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,649
they have value but I mean we get a lot

726
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,299
of list of indicators that we record

727
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:46,289
that we got this list but we can't do

728
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,158
anything with it because there's no

729
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:51,299
context so it this is a this is a

730
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,919
question that I noticed in the

731
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:55,830
conferences does that count as cyber

732
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,360
Intel you state that you record those

733
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,619
kind of things in a system what kind of

734
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,449
system is that it's at home brew

735
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:03,119
northeastern it's it's a home brew

736
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,399
system where we we record the analysis

737
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:09,749
that we did the actions that we took

738
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:11,729
it's it's basically a ticket system and

739
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,110
you just stick your your comments below

740
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,139
the last person's comments on that

741
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,519
particular issue or indicator so it's

742
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:19,110
searchable so we can keep track of

743
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,610
everything that we've done we've got

744
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,619
years and years of data built into the

745
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,110
system so we can see oh hey someone sent

746
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,459
this IP with absolutely no context we

747
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,408
didn't know what to do with it now we do

748
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,029
so we keep track of things like that but

749
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:32,490
we don't necessarily act on them until

750
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:36,860
we understand the value of the the

751
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,860
context there's a question back there

752
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,740
actually a comment so how do you

753
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:50,269
validate the confidence do you use

754
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:53,200
secondary resources do you look at the

755
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,490
data itself yeah I'm asking you because

756
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,659
we've been through this and I want to

757
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,659
see what other people have done oh

758
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,990
you're mentioning the actual confidence

759
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:08,750
capabilities are you choosing that in

760
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:11,450
isolation are you actually comparing

761
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,960
against others as an example we found

762
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:17,299
that certain well we actually exercised

763
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,029
and found that certain feeds actually

764
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:23,210
pull off other feeds after a X amount of

765
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:25,429
time period and we found that if a bad

766
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,860
piece of data gets shoved into one of

767
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:32,000
the initial feeds it runs the whole

768
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,889
gamut all the way up so how do you

769
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,970
actually deal with the confidence how

770
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:37,928
are you dealing with the confidence

771
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,929
level on that

772
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,820
okay do you actually put a probability

773
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,270
rating on it or do you just use high

774
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:19,270
medium low okay

775
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,449
ok

776
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:41,230
yeah go ahead you can make money doing

777
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,399
workshops for vendors on how cuz I see

778
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,200
all these threat Intel reports like you

779
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,840
do too and I just want a facepalm and be

780
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,909
in submission just some things you said

781
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,529
you could expand on your moonlight make

782
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,480
thousands and thousands of dollars every

783
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:53,980
week just for doing because every vendor

784
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,659
I work with every you got to have a

785
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,919
report and everyone's coming up and

786
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:58,690
those that don't have them have to do it

787
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,279
I think they should listen to your talk

788
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,889
I don't know it's good it's great it

789
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,720
solves a big challenge that I have as an

790
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,799
analyst and then all my customers have

791
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,869
because they're all chasing these

792
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,789
reports and everyone's trying to to

793
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:11,619
ingest the indicators on them and

794
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:13,330
spending all this time manage them

795
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:16,119
trying to correlate the thread actor

796
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,199
names so you know it goes back to the

797
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,519
marketing component that we're talking

798
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,440
about a little bit before and try to

799
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:27,659
balance a marketing perspective of this

800
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:31,539
stuff I said you always have questions

801
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:33,940
there it is can you comment in your

802
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:35,440
opinion on the the feasibility so we

803
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,919
were talking about you know this data

804
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,179
and how do we can we programmatically i

805
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,690
think is the word with the word used

806
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:46,059
assign confidence to the state as it's

807
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:49,019
being ingested can you comment on your

808
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:52,029
feelings on the feasibility of that

809
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:54,879
based on you know what we've seen about

810
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:57,009
CTI threat until feeds and things like

811
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:58,209
that what are your thoughts on whether

812
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,940
or not that's something that's going to

813
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:03,100
be feasible in the long term so I think

814
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:06,070
this goes back to the data versus

815
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,840
assessment slide and Alex Pinto had a

816
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,570
great presentation on looking at the

817
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,299
data as a data scientist and I mostly

818
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:17,168
focus on the assessment side of the

819
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:19,720
intelligence spectrum and I got to be

820
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:21,070
honest data without someone I had this

821
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,129
on my first slide someone said this

822
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:26,259
yesterday indicators without context are

823
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,519
not intelligence or vulnerabilities

824
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:30,399
without context are not valuable

825
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,899
something like that and so data without

826
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,018
context in my opinion is not

827
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:36,639
intelligence this is just data if you

828
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:39,190
have a list of indicators this is just

829
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:41,619
data if you provide it context and you

830
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,600
say this indicator list is bad well

831
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,500
that's not valuable context because who

832
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,419
is it bad for

833
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,340
is it bad for everyone in the whole

834
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,900
world is it bad for people in China is

835
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,090
it bad for people in Germany is it bad

836
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,770
for people in a certain industry is it

837
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,929
bad for people who run certain systems

838
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,790
or have certain hardware there's there's

839
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,800
a lot of data there's a lot of

840
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,620
assessment that needs to go into this

841
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,450
data is bad and so I don't consider

842
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,729
indicator list to be intelligence

843
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,770
because there was no assessment done and

844
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,590
if there was assessment done it's not

845
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,418
provided to you and so why do you think

846
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,700
this indicator list is bad what is your

847
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:18,009
reasoning what it what were you what are

848
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:20,109
you using to back up your your assess

849
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,240
your assertion that this is a bad

850
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,710
indicator list if all you're telling me

851
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:29,379
is this is bad it's based on my

852
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:31,480
reputation um sorry no I don't consider

853
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:37,270
that intelligence that's argument from

854
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,560
authority and that's a fallacy so if you

855
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,989
can't if you can't sit down and explain

856
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,360
why each indicator or why each group of

857
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:45,069
indicators is bad you haven't provided

858
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,139
me with intelligence you provided me

859
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:49,750
with data you're expecting me to do the

860
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,540
assessment and the analysis which is

861
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,918
fine if that was the intent but you

862
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,889
should state upfront hey these are bad

863
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:00,879
indicators go do your own research so

864
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:02,320
that's my answer to your question and

865
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,170
then we have a question or comment in

866
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,980
back here go ahead oh one other

867
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:12,460
indicator is the type of data is it a

868
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,680
short medium or long term play there

869
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:18,280
have been long term protocols that have

870
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,980
been used for compromise well known

871
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,930
compromises since 2001 those aren't on

872
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,410
the list anymore because people have

873
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,100
expired them out but i also have monthly

874
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:32,529
once and we have within a few seconds

875
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:35,170
but there's no context you got to have

876
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,620
context and then we have a question in

877
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,620
the back here

878
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:54,559
it's an IP address okay I can look at

879
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,920
what network hasn't been one sad

880
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,049
associated with if I people metadata

881
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,390
okay off of parallel and years or near

882
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:04,670
Austin statistically I could say you

883
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,609
know I've got within one standard

884
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,980
deviation okay this particular IP

885
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:13,220
address is nine times in the last 30

886
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,859
days prior to that it only hit once you

887
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,169
know in three months so the fact that is

888
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:21,490
popping okay and is popular for multiple

889
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:24,200
sources I can just report that okay

890
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:26,509
we're opening you know we're opening up

891
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,460
to look at it further because it's not

892
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,609
normal behavior when something like that

893
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,579
so just just when I IP address comes in

894
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:38,210
okay it's kind of that to us it's the

895
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:40,430
analyst role to say get the context okay

896
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,799
the other thing is is like yeah we

897
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,980
believe the reports are real pain in the

898
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:44,980
neck

899
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,480
ha

900
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,370
you

901
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,619
so this is this is my concern about into

902
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:44,810
threat intelligence reports in the

903
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:46,790
journalism industry AP and Reuters do

904
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,839
like ninety percent of the reporting and

905
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:51,140
then everybody else just copies the

906
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,880
reports and my concern is that the cyber

907
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:56,029
threat intelligence industry will end up

908
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,310
doing that because if you look at the

909
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:02,930
source of like ninety percent of the

910
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:05,960
reports on the internet there ap AFP or

911
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,910
Reuters it's ridiculous all those three

912
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,609
sources provide the majority of your

913
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,779
news reporting so my concern is that

914
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:14,420
that was the same thing will happen to

915
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,510
threat intelligence and hopefully we can

916
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,740
all keep producing positive good

917
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:23,290
reliable intelligence and prevent that

918
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,290
from happening so I think I'm at a time

919
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:39,240
everyone Riley here again i'm going to

920
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:42,270
introduce Mike right before his next

921
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,580
talk Mike you are speaking next right I

922
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:49,550
just didn't jump in here I hope you are

923
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:52,140
I first met Michael opport at the first

924
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:54,120
sans digital forensics in an to respond

925
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,609
summit not I don't think we met prior to

926
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,410
that point we knew of each other took

927
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,960
the class but we knew each other and you

928
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,420
know you took my class a long time ago

929
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,370
but I remember Mike specifically at this

930
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,050
event because I remember getting a panel

931
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:12,120
together and Mike's talk was one of

932
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,500
these talks that literally had you know

933
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,480
everyone initially sitting back is kind

934
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,560
of in today just like this one here then

935
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,440
all of a sudden everyone just suddenly

936
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,240
leaned forward now that the title of

937
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,240
this talk if you remember you remember
