1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
talked with some of the folks involved

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,180
in something you may have heard of

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,770
called Operation SMN if you hadn't heard

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,500
of it they're going to give you a brief

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,540
introduction up just quick poll how many

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,970
people are familiar with op SMN okay

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,590
fair amount of people so first I want to

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,640
remind everyone I've gotten a lot of

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,310
great feedback about the summit so far

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,080
hopefully that that's a that's a

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,269
predominant view but the only way that

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,879
it that it counts for the sands powers

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,149
that be is if you fill out the surveys

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,610
so please please please fill those out I

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,950
know it means a lot for Rick and I and

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,440
it also means laughter sands so that we

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,600
can you know continue to do this summit

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,260
and hopefully continue to improve upon

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,050
it one other administrative announcement

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,420
for those of you who are taking classes

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,538
you will be able to pick up your class

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,629
materials out here in the back any time

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,789
I guess after this and into this

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,539
afternoon if that's something you want

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,820
to do and I think without further delay

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,790
i'm going to go ahead and let the panel

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,960
introduce themselves and we will get

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,759
moving on this so red rich so um I'm

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,929
rich Barger chief intelligence officer

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:26,100
at Trek connect and our role within the

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:30,119
operation was everything from providing

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,119
some adult supervision for Andre to you

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,350
know doing some some of the initial

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,390
drafting on the reporting sharing

35
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,390
signatures that we used operationally

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,770
opening up the platform our connect to

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,350
allow folks to kind of collate some of

38
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:52,720
their research so it's kind of a

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,199
overview cool Brian bartholomew I'm with

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,880
eyesight partners we're a vendor out

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,910
there that basically provides threat

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,229
intelligence so we helped out we pretty

43
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,229
much coughed up everything we had on

44
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,850
this group and this thread actor and we

45
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,820
had some unique visibilities for some

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,650
victims out there so we kind of toss

47
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:17,290
that into the mix and hopefully it

48
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,730
helped out I'm Zack relief I'm the

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,900
director of data science apply data

50
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,280
science at Nevada our role was kind of

51
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,490
kicking this whole thing off we started

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,250
the SMN and personally I did a lot of

53
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,450
the network analysis and infrastructure

54
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,510
identification for this particular

55
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,910
threat actor and I am nikolov a I'm the

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,100
chief security officer of bit9 carbon

57
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,230
black I run our internal security

58
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,150
program and play a lot of little lineman

59
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,820
functions between our different business

60
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,310
units partners and external entities and

61
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,590
whatnot and our role in the op we came

62
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,120
in pretty late to the game so our role

63
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,760
was kind of a little bit of narrative

64
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,290
tweaking and whatnot and mostly making

65
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,299
sure that everything that we knew about

66
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,519
the actor that didn't somehow betray one

67
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:07,239
of our customers that found its way into

68
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:09,070
the report green light all right Zak so

69
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,850
you want to go ahead and what's out the

70
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,850
slide walk us through

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,490
and that's it

72
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,270
there we go so yeah we've we've titled

73
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,459
this with a little bit of

74
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,590
tongue-in-cheek off s men from mall cop

75
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,670
2 Voltron it's kind of title that way

76
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,350
just mostly because of the fact that

77
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,059
this is one of the larger industry

78
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,680
efforts probably one of the first wave

79
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,480
of industry efforts where everyone kind

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,160
of gets together works together shares

81
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,600
all the indicators of compromise and

82
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,579
actually has a meaningful effect at the

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,430
end so operation SMN was a coordinated

84
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,459
effort to degrade what we've called the

85
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,800
axiom groups capabilities we kind of

86
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,750
started by searching out malware

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,700
associated and related to hike it and

88
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,110
it's just started to expand and expand

89
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,768
until we got this fuller operating

90
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,390
picture of this fairly advanced actor

91
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:07,540
who was doing a lot of activities that

92
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:09,549
were relating to a IP theft and and

93
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,000
large-scale compromise of international

94
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,920
organizations it was led by us Nevada

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,410
there were nine publicly involved

96
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,969
vendors all of whom were sharing data

97
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,650
and we had a pretty substantial

98
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,820
coordination with a large number of

99
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,560
additional security vendors and

100
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,000
researchers who have decided to be

101
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,419
silent partners for one reason or

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,430
another so the strategic goals of the

103
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,909
overall operation were to establish a

104
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,310
repeatable playbook for us the industry

105
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,750
as well as the ecosystem owners to be

106
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,729
able to leverage as we kind of go

107
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,169
forward this is not the first advanced

108
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,030
actor we've seen this is certainly not

109
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,349
going to be the last but we've

110
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,270
definitely decided that there was a

111
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,270
there were better ways of dealing with

112
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,340
this kind of scenario than have been

113
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,430
seen in the last oh I don't know several

114
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,200
years we wanted to demonstrate very

115
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,000
clearly the role that industry could

116
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,039
play against threats like this you know

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,539
leaving by example and then finally we

118
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,950
wanted to make sure the operation had a

119
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,390
meaningful effect the last thing we

120
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,849
wanted to do was do a lot of reporting

121
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,349
do a lot of talks and not really have

122
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,780
any remediations not have any customers

123
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,039
or anyone outside and industry be

124
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,440
actually protected from this particular

125
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,330
threat so to that end we kind of had to

126
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,219
capture and share all of our tools

127
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,750
techniques and practices are reverse

128
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,039
engineering knowledge and a lot of the

129
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,720
other stuff that we extracted during the

130
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,599
course of this operation with the

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,310
entirety of the world

132
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,199
so this is the timeline that we kind of

133
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,719
moved through since the beginning of the

134
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,289
operation we had started identifying

135
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:38,469
victims of hike it individually around

136
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:40,150
july of 2014 and as we started to

137
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,620
identify these victims and start

138
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,229
interviewing them and start speaking

139
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,909
with customers who may have been related

140
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:50,080
we started to get this fuller picture of

141
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:52,949
a large toolchain being used to use

142
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,430
hiked it as kind of the end result of a

143
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,900
long tail compromise August 2014 we

144
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,009
started identifying partners as we had

145
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,330
identified that this was something much

146
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,219
larger than we'd be able to deal with

147
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,229
certainly on our own we needed the help

148
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:08,020
of a larger industry group to be able to

149
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:10,900
be effective 2014 is when we published

150
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,150
most of our findings on the 15th I

151
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,938
believe my memory still serves we

152
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,948
published the initial triage reports and

153
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,750
the initial announcement about the the

154
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,370
fact there was an operation going on and

155
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,909
then I believe it would've been the 28th

156
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,250
when we released all the rule sets

157
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:28,719
reporting in the fullest possible extent

158
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,569
and we started to do large-scale

159
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:32,919
ecosystem mitigation and then from

160
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,810
november till today we've been doing

161
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,568
continuing monitoring measurement and

162
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,159
adjustment of mitigations within the

163
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:43,300
ecosystem we've had a very large and

164
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:45,069
very measurable effect so one of the

165
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,800
things that we had to deal with when we

166
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,509
started this coalition was identifying

167
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,900
people and deciding who needed to be

168
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:55,089
involved those of us on the on the

169
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,099
coalition who had been working in this

170
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,750
space for a little while we all know the

171
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:01,180
issues you have when you have too many

172
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,310
people in the room and so we started

173
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,889
with identifying people that we knew we

174
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,120
could directly trust obviously anyone

175
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,159
with a personal relationship and we

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,719
began to expand that as the operation

177
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:13,330
went on for people who were able to

178
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:14,979
bring actual capabilities to bear they

179
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,688
either could present you know reverse

180
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,240
engineering talent or they had customers

181
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:21,310
who were known to be compromised or they

182
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,930
had various tools that we could use as a

183
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,210
remediation and interdiction kind of

184
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,710
support all these things were what we

185
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,469
considered when we started inviting more

186
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,029
and more people to the group the focus

187
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:32,199
partners the smaller ones were brought

188
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,569
in for you know smaller niche

189
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,560
capabilities and the larger ones were

190
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,370
generally brought in for their

191
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,590
visibility and scale into the

192
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,270
larger windows ecosystem as a whole and

193
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,770
we were all under a different set of

194
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,219
FDA's it was actually kind of hilarious

195
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,620
at certain stages we had we had our own

196
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,660
customer nda's which we all had to

197
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,610
adhere to and then we had the larger

198
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,940
operational NDA which we all had to

199
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,139
adhere to and it worked out

200
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,460
fantastically because of the members

201
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,560
that we had because of the reach that

202
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,270
the members had we were able to collect

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,130
a large number of samples we were able

204
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,469
to share everything deliberately we were

205
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,570
able to do you know unified work on one

206
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,060
particular set without violating

207
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,510
anyone's nda's whatsoever and this was

208
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,850
this was a serious success on the whole

209
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,229
what are the questions that I've gotten

210
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,490
when when speaking about this report and

211
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,949
certainly we got immediately after the

212
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,020
releasing of it was why wasn't the

213
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,389
invite list larger and obviously you've

214
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,469
got the general logistical overhead and

215
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,900
you've got the operational security

216
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,580
concerns but we partnered with so many

217
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,380
of the major ecosystem owners that we

218
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,210
were able to leverage a lot of their

219
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,279
capabilities so that we were able to

220
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,169
reach you know 64 industry partners

221
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,360
across 22 individual countries through

222
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,549
programs they had already had up and

223
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,320
running and this ultimately was our main

224
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,329
outreach in addition to the reporting we

225
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,520
had directed contact through industry

226
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,930
groups to be able to inform people on

227
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,970
how to protect their environments and

228
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,079
how to update particular products that

229
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,560
they had so that their customers would

230
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,490
be protected the interdiction is

231
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,589
something that I've been kind of

232
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,490
referring to a little bit we're using a

233
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:03,800
little bit of a different word than

234
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,870
remediation remediation infers that we

235
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,670
kind of walked out and we shut down all

236
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,470
the malware everywhere and and that was

237
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,910
the end of it and and that's not what

238
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,950
you deal with when you're dealing with

239
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,209
an advanced actor we definitely went out

240
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,650
we definitely shut down a large amount

241
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,779
of malware but this is an ongoing effort

242
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,180
we need it to be able to continuously

243
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:22,459
knock this actor back advanced actors do

244
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,170
not stop after the first roadblock they

245
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:25,670
are funded they have this is their job

246
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,949
this is what they do all day none of us

247
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,510
stop when we have the first compromise

248
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,339
or we see the first roadblock we keep

249
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,050
going back at it and that's exactly what

250
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,610
happens though goal of our interdiction

251
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,959
was not to remove an actor from the face

252
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,580
of the Internet the goal of an

253
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,310
interdiction is to make sure that actor

254
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,540
is put into a continuing cycle where

255
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,459
they're knocked back they have to be

256
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,959
forced to make economic decisions about

257
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,640
whether or not they can continue

258
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,079
attacking we've taken their tools away

259
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,790
they now need to make some kind of

260
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:50,290
cost-benefit analysis to creating new

261
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,670
tools

262
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,839
and and that's something that we've

263
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,860
definitely been seeing throughout the

264
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,370
course of this and we're counting that

265
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,500
is a huge success finally we wanted to

266
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,660
make sure that we didn't have anything

267
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,550
inside of a necessarily remediation

268
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,870
effort where it was a single vendor we

269
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,250
need to make sure every vendor had all

270
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,319
the data we needed to make sure every

271
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,300
vendor had new rule sets and identifiers

272
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:13,300
and we wanted to make sure that no one

273
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,829
was able to use this as a leverage point

274
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,880
in some of the larger industry where

275
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,500
they could say you know we're the only

276
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,730
ones who know about this know that

277
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,690
that's not effective at the end of the

278
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:26,290
day so the aftermath of what happened so

279
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,990
post October we started to see axiom

280
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,719
begin reacting to a lot of the activity

281
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,550
that we did we saw multiple partners

282
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,430
release their own remediation efforts

283
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,439
and and their own toolset efforts

284
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,750
immediately after the publication which

285
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,240
is exactly what we're looking for

286
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:46,240
overall we saw over 9,000 remediations

287
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,519
and we saw almost 2,000 I confections

288
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
which we identify as late-stage

289
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,110
intrusions that were detected in

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,910
progress which is fantastic and the

291
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,560
final thing that we we are counting as a

292
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,480
major success is the fact that reporting

293
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,310
as a whole was very controlled we didn't

294
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,810
get sensationalized we trying to we did

295
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,609
everything we definitely could and we I

296
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,959
think we succeeded in many ways and

297
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,290
keeping the focus on the most important

298
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,260
thing which is that we hurt a very

299
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,490
significant threat actor on the internet

300
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,880
so these are some remediation numbers

301
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,490
from our industry partners and they let

302
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,199
us publish these today family names on

303
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,579
one side and the number of machines that

304
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,079
were actually remediated on the other

305
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,239
and I'm using the word remediation here

306
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,099
specifically because these were active

307
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,319
malware infections this this was code

308
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,000
running at the time when it when it was

309
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,399
remediated and removed from the local

310
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,649
machine if you if you look towards the

311
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,779
middle there that's 188 different hi kit

312
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,019
infections and that is a huge number

313
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,240
because in the in the general order of

314
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,850
operations that this particular actor

315
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,470
has been observed using by the time hike

316
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,990
it is installed on your network they're

317
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,250
in and you cannot get them out it's very

318
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,649
very difficult to get these guys out

319
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,129
once they've gotten in there

320
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:59,610
and hike it was their tool for long

321
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,680
stage persistence and information egress

322
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,589
so by the time we saw hike it someone

323
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,739
had lost intellectual property there's

324
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:10,079
just no two ways about it and we saw 188

325
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,939
individual machines get remediated

326
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,849
across some very large number of

327
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:17,790
organizations and then this is the

328
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,319
number of blocked samples that we had

329
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,910
observed from this particular vendor and

330
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,498
there there are all sorts of reasons why

331
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,939
numbers can be weird you know somewhere

332
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,319
blocked but other vendors before this

333
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:27,599
one could get to it and all the other

334
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:29,490
fun stuff there but the blocked samples

335
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,800
here indicate samples that were removed

336
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,779
before they had a chance to run which is

337
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,339
absolutely fantastic so we've had a

338
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,899
we've had a directed and measurable

339
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,929
success and one of the best things that

340
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,519
we've observed is after starting put out

341
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:44,069
the different vendors and their

342
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,470
remediation tactics we've seen axiom

343
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:48,420
actually change their tools and we've

344
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,040
seen minor alterations to their you know

345
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,779
techniques and the general practices

346
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,099
that they have we've seen the move to

347
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,119
new malware families and we're observing

348
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,369
them and there's going to be another

349
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:58,439
publication in the hopefully fairly near

350
00:12:56,369 --> 00:13:00,029
future where we're able to knock them

351
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:02,339
back again and continuously put them in

352
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:06,179
that cycle of having to reevaluate their

353
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,949
their methodology that is the you know

354
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,540
10 15 minute overview of everything that

355
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:10,920
we did if you haven't read the report

356
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,748
that should be a fairly succinct

357
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,149
overview what's up on the Sun the slide

358
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:17,309
right now is a large list of things that

359
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,480
all of us and certainly everyone else

360
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,579
within the coalition who was a

361
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,110
participant notice that things that

362
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,969
worked and things that didn't and I

363
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,860
won't go through all these right here

364
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,199
specifically let's take a second here

365
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,509
before we start kind of instigating some

366
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:33,899
activity well I have a few questions for

367
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:38,399
you guys um so I'll get it started while

368
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:40,499
the audience kind of Ponder's it so

369
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,170
first of all just for I think baseline

370
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:45,959
clarity what are some of the other names

371
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,689
that you know different industries use

372
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,910
for this particular intrusion set that

373
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:53,480
you went after me one of you guys yeah

374
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,250
yeah so it's been the

375
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,959
a lot of water under the bridge since we

376
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,180
put that out but there was a you know

377
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,310
it's all within the report was there was

378
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,920
a handful from not only the actual

379
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,050
actors are the different industry names

380
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,420
for the actors but then also the

381
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,609
capability right so the back door would

382
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,010
would take on a name and so then you had

383
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,220
Tower of Babel issues with mapping that

384
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:19,790
and uncertainty to a certain degree as

385
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,519
to you know whether you know a certain

386
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:25,189
certain handle lined up with you know a

387
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,040
certain you know whatever and so a lot

388
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,310
of campaign names yeah yeah names and so

389
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,439
I'm basically trying to just yeah yeah

390
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,388
get it so that the folks who you know

391
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,350
don't you know know know this actor by

392
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,610
different names ken has been so weird of

393
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,220
Aurora panda i believe was kind of

394
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,880
wrapped into that some of deep panda I

395
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,040
believe hit my nose oh you later there

396
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,130
then you had we actually call the group

397
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,480
tailgater there's a name called sports

398
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,029
fans that's out there for some of those

399
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,649
that know that flower lady was yeah

400
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,240
under this to you can clearly see

401
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:02,569
there's like 19 different names which

402
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,819
right right which is exactly why I asked

403
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:07,099
so hopefully one of those rings bells

404
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:09,110
yeah and it and that that maps back to a

405
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,110
time in which everybody was in a very

406
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,300
much of a go at it alone mindset which

407
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,829
then when you kind of come and you

408
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,979
attack the problem in the different

409
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:21,680
different angle you're you're certainly

410
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,089
dealing with some of something historic

411
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,630
baggage then you give it a different

412
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,279
name yeah so if we could sit on that for

413
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,620
a second so we tried so we when we

414
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:35,079
authored the summary we we made in an

415
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,079
attempt to use a variable essentially

416
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,110
difficulty for what we were going to

417
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,819
call this thing and we were like we

418
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,470
gotta pick a noun like this just isn't

419
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:45,050
working like dollar sign threat like

420
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,570
that's not gonna go you know over well

421
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,040
so it's a huge challenge and

422
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,080
you know I don't you know have a

423
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,870
solution right now you certainly and I

424
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,070
don't want to kind of dive into the

425
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,810
nomenclature issues we've seen from the

426
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,720
antivirus industry that is somewhat of

427
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:03,859
an intractable problem but all right

428
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,200
great and and so I guess you showed some

429
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,310
of the numbers that you guys you know

430
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,680
were able to achieve did you have any

431
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:16,640
expectations going in did you have a

432
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,290
objective goal other than the general

433
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,569
goal of you know we need to make things

434
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,540
make this more costly for them did you

435
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,880
have a vantage point up front where you

436
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,459
said this is the quantitative problem

437
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,640
and here are our quantitative results

438
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:34,940
and to you know kind of align and

439
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,310
measure success based on what you hope

440
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,860
to accomplish so at the very beginning

441
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,540
of all this we had only an idea that

442
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,860
there were a handful of compromises and

443
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,180
and having looked at some of the

444
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,190
partners that we had and some of the

445
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,810
customers across the coalition out as a

446
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,640
whole we definitely had the idea that

447
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,790
when we started getting deeper and

448
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,189
deeper into into hike it we saw pretty

449
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,660
clearly that there was a operational

450
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,960
cadence which led us to believe there

451
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:03,079
was significantly more compromises than

452
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,850
we had samples for we'd see how these

453
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,680
guys tended to like doing large-scale

454
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,060
watering hole attacks and then finding

455
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,199
their victims filtering it down and

456
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,000
getting in from there there were a

457
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,579
couple of exceptions to that rule but

458
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,459
they definitely liked that strategy and

459
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,930
as we went through the reverse

460
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,270
engineering process we started finding

461
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,370
configurations and other materials that

462
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,420
were allowing us to identify that you

463
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,188
know there it seemed like we saw

464
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,620
something moving in the deep and we

465
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,120
started working with some of the data

466
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,860
partners that we had and we started to

467
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,600
do correlation through a lot of the

468
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,459
infrastructure that was a made visible

469
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,750
and we started to see more and more and

470
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,550
more okay there's there's definitely

471
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,180
more here I can't tell you we had a

472
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,560
specific number we expected to see

473
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,450
couple handfuls worth maybe three digits

474
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,460
worth and the data that we've been

475
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,930
getting back from from the remediation

476
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,210
partners from people who've been able to

477
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,200
push out rules and app on host effect

478
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,570
has been it looks like we were

479
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,399
yeah I think another thing that should

480
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,710
be point out one of the reasons why this

481
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:01,899
actor is is one of the more interesting

482
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,549
ones is they are one of the

483
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:06,309
sophisticated ones they are one of the

484
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,379
very sophisticated ones there there

485
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:09,850
malware is you know of the the upper

486
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,610
crust that we see out of the Chinese

487
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,350
actors but particularly there are their

488
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,168
social engineering tactics are among the

489
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,689
best and they're uh they're targeting is

490
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:21,730
a very good like they are very good at

491
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,710
you know doing water hole attacks and

492
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,659
very significant sites right before

493
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,750
major political events and things like

494
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:30,399
that and they're one of the few actors

495
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,769
I've dealt with that's done a

496
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:35,049
multi-stage spear phishing attacks where

497
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:37,210
they will interact with people and build

498
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:39,879
up trust before they actually come in

499
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,440
with some kind of halo so they're one of

500
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,240
the few that do that a lot of them you

501
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,490
just see those one stroke spear phishing

502
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,230
attacks hey here's a well-crafted email

503
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,570
you know click on the thing that you can

504
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,159
unclick these guys are one of the ones

505
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,529
that will do the interaction they speak

506
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,909
extremely good English you know they're

507
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,830
there they're one of the ones that if

508
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:58,679
you do analysis on you know you quickly

509
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:03,279
gained some respect for their tactical

510
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:07,710
sophistication so yeah I'm going to stop

511
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:10,360
asking questions and Hawkeye that Mike

512
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,909
I'll have this for a while I have

513
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,908
several questions number one

514
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:21,510
infrastructure families okay we was

515
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,219
there any specific infrastructure

516
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:27,059
failings where we could take lessons and

517
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:30,070
hand it back to the security architects

518
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,220
so that we can create infrastructure

519
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:35,280
that provides long-term protection or

520
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,230
was everything good

521
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,370
no everything was not good out if

522
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,780
everything was good none of us in this

523
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:44,040
room would have jobs quite frankly so so

524
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,629
the thing that stood out to me the most

525
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:51,409
certainly was peripheral infrastructure

526
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,180
stuff that is hosted outside of your DMZ

527
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:58,320
also there was very clearly from a lot

528
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:00,420
of the victims they had let me step back

529
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,780
let's let's rephrase that what we saw

530
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,670
was this particular actor going out of

531
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,700
their way to identify a primary target

532
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,590
they would identify all of the all of

533
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,000
the organizations that were considered

534
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,760
partners to that primary target

535
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,560
compromised them and then proceeded to

536
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,040
do phishing attacks or other kinds of

537
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,409
initial ingress based off of that web

538
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,909
infrastructure and a lot of that would

539
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,040
just simply not be observed I don't know

540
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,840
if you guys both have some visibility

541
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,700
into these areas to explaining trust

542
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,639
they were very good at exploiting trust

543
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,040
in a certain degree when they would get

544
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,500
into further levels or further phases of

545
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,629
exploitation that there were they were

546
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,190
essentially remotely integrated into

547
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:46,110
your enterprise with specific

548
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,850
deployments of backdoors or unique to

549
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,379
that unique and tailored to the

550
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,230
infrastructure which they operated they

551
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,270
had one really cool aspect about this

552
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,210
group was typically when you're tracking

553
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:59,490
teams like this you focus on I mean you

554
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,650
know fixie was up here earlier like P

555
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,110
DNS infrastructure domains all that fun

556
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,700
stuff this group once they got in you

557
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,020
couldn't focus on infrastructure because

558
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,270
it would only tell you about that one

559
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,610
victim they actually went out and and

560
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,410
for each important victim that they had

561
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,260
once they had high kid or something else

562
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,880
on there of that level they would create

563
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,550
an entire infrastructure for their

564
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,250
command and control and only use it for

565
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,750
that victim and what's interesting is

566
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,280
they would create domain names with the

567
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,190
victim name in it they would use

568
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,530
internal proxies to actually ship that

569
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,420
data back out so from a network admin /

570
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,980
Specter aspect you you're looking at

571
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,930
your external gateways and all of a

572
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,410
sudden your internal systems are the

573
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,510
ones that

574
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,250
actually doing the exfil so I mean these

575
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,680
guys are really good about you know

576
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,720
staying focused on target by target

577
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,430
basis versus the typical actors that

578
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,740
have you know one set of infrastructure

579
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,900
you can latch on to them via this victim

580
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,490
and then find all these other guys so

581
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,100
that's part of what this program was

582
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,540
about was we realized you know we have

583
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,860
to get out there and get the word out

584
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,360
and figure out who's been affected

585
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,219
because without that you're going to

586
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,840
miss a whole ton of stuff just just

587
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,550
again I just really want to throw this

588
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,840
in the picture the larger picture of

589
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,370
like what we're doing it like threat

590
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,500
intelligence like we've all seen the

591
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,600
pyramid a pain model several times this

592
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,830
week and we've all kind of acknowledged

593
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,330
that most of us are crushed by the

594
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,970
Pyramid of pain because we got all the

595
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,280
state domain and IP telemetry and we're

596
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,290
doing a poor job using it integrating it

597
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,430
managing it and all that one of the

598
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,040
reasons I really want to encourage

599
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,590
people to read the report is it very

600
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,840
focused on the TTP's you know how this

601
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,449
this actor operates and what kind of

602
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,709
tactics they use now like me as a see so

603
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,660
when I'm sitting back and looking at

604
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,940
where I'm going to direct my resources

605
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,010
to improve my you know you know my

606
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,980
overall you know network robustness

607
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,540
resiliency security and whatnot I find

608
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,640
that kind of threat intelligence to be

609
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,560
incredibly valuable because I can sit

610
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,020
back and I can play the what if game and

611
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,820
I can do my actor empathy thing and

612
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,160
figure out how I got a structure my

613
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,530
infrastructure to create a battle space

614
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,830
where I can fight an actor like this so

615
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,750
the the outcome of the you know all the

616
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,310
various rules and signatures that got

617
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,100
pushed out to the industry in which to

618
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:12,149
cause the actor paint so we cause the

619
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,649
actor pain that pain is done in the

620
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,480
context of you know can you use that

621
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,710
information to protect yourself now know

622
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,170
that information is done we've already

623
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,820
caused the actor pain the stuff that is

624
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,650
really really useful at this point I

625
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,810
think is the analysis about how they

626
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,400
operate what their tactics are because

627
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,690
you have to think about that because you

628
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,730
have to construct your network

629
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,460
environment to be able to fight actors

630
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,550
that use those kind of tactics okay so

631
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,490
so in summary it sounds like open source

632
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:40,740
intelligence it sounds like signature

633
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,870
based systems are failing so behavior

634
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,770
bae systems really need to start getting

635
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:48,120
into the

636
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:53,220
infrastructure it looked like the unique

637
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:56,370
identification of targets and it also

638
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,550
looks like supply chain Oh sir eyes are

639
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:02,429
the yeah service okay the second piece

640
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:04,470
sorry I tell you I've got a couple have

641
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,750
you followed up with the loss of

642
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,850
specific intellectual property to

643
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:12,420
patents because I did this with a

644
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:14,490
specific customer and we were able to

645
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:18,420
identify a specific law firm that was

646
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:22,830
fronting these patents right up the

647
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,990
street and use that to start questioning

648
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,270
what was going on have you guys actually

649
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,700
taken it to the next level because that

650
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,950
invalidates patents that costs money and

651
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,830
that provides additional association

652
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,330
back to the adversary okay well good I

653
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:41,399
was going to say like if you look at the

654
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:42,899
summary exam we did diamond methodology

655
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,270
you guys are familiar with the demo

656
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,710
methodology for treason analysis where

657
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:52,800
we attempted to map kind of a victim up

658
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:54,960
mapping of high-level organization types

659
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,230
that were being targeted in and around

660
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,100
the timing of the targeting to then

661
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:04,040
infer you know adversary motivations

662
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,909
that sort of thing so specific

663
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,370
intellectual property I wouldn't say we

664
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,290
dealt that far in terms of analyzing

665
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,449
victim type infrastructure but that was

666
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,280
part of the corpus of the analysis in

667
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,370
Lee certainly not as a coalition of we

668
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,290
dived that daily individual partners may

669
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,879
have but I can't speak to that drug in

670
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,899
the future there's probably a room for

671
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:28,460
academia to jump in that particular spot

672
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:31,470
how do you guys find the balance between

673
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,780
degra gating the adversaries actions

674
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:37,020
versus destroying organizations defenses

675
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,639
against that adversary yeah so that's my

676
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,580
hot topic of the day honestly under the

677
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,040
add you have an Intel gain and loss on

678
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,379
this right so you know we're trying to

679
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,149
get the word out we're trying to exact

680
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,440
said we're not eradicate the adversary

681
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,090
we're throwing a wrench into the big

682
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,520
engine and we're basically causing them

683
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,110
to just retool and start over a problem

684
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,700
when you do that any time you do that

685
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,439
anytime one of these reports comes

686
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,010
public whether it's privately done or

687
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,450
through a group like this you know you

688
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,400
you're forcing them to change their

689
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,830
tactics at which point you have to start

690
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,270
all over again as well um we kind of

691
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,460
came to the conclusion that these guys

692
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,920
were so prolific and they were causing

693
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,770
so much damage out there that the Intel

694
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,900
loss actually kind of you know with was

695
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,850
was less compared to what we would gain

696
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,440
from actually causing you know guys I

697
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,179
would say the clean the counter to that

698
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,130
though was that we did have some common

699
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:32,440
customers in which we were able to say

700
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:35,110
to bring bring other partners into the

701
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,780
circle and that we're open to being a

702
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:40,870
silent partner and give us insights as

703
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,879
to when we begin to deliver affects the

704
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,229
effectiveness of those right so they

705
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,670
could report back you know they're

706
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,840
shifting right they're doing this this

707
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:51,580
is new and and so that was folks are

708
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,740
potentially thinking about doing this in

709
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,780
the future you know playing for that

710
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,790
plan for finding people that might be

711
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,740
currently dealing with the specific

712
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,600
target that you're going to work against

713
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:05,380
and incorporate that into your overall

714
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,959
plan so that you that when you do have

715
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,300
an intel gain loss issue or potentially

716
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,370
you build some resiliency is here of

717
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,320
your visibility yeah add a little bit

718
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,760
because it into law scheme calculus is

719
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,770
hard one of the hardest things i think

720
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,060
we deal with on a regular basis so like

721
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,250
you know let's take a look at two

722
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,500
situations right let's take a look at

723
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,570
the the mandiant apt one report great

724
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,460
report that report was necessary because

725
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,040
it was a wake-up call three and a half

726
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,680
days of above the fold coverage in

727
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,510
newspapers and CNN that did a very good

728
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,090
helpful thing for our community now

729
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:40,000
however comment clue crew are clowns

730
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:42,399
okay that group is a bunch of clowns

731
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,090
they are totally playable based or their

732
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,500
malware sucks they reuse seat they reuse

733
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,270
see to infrastructure

734
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,190
are all over the place they reuse

735
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:53,080
malware variance between multiple

736
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,670
companies so like if you're on top of

737
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,350
your game you know you'll see their

738
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,360
stuff activate you know six control

739
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,649
channels go up and no data flies over

740
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,300
them because it wasn't your company they

741
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,470
were activating they were interested in

742
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,320
that day they just haven't have to

743
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:07,560
activate eight companies at one time yet

744
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,870
where they wanted to go the clowns right

745
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,720
so when that dad went out and all those

746
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,340
indicators got burned you know there was

747
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,100
an argument that it had a detrimental

748
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,439
effect toward detection but the reason

749
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,510
is because they were clowns now when you

750
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,040
look at like a group like Acxiom where

751
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,110
they're very good about making sure that

752
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,180
all their c2 infrastructure and specific

753
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,879
now we're half is and the easiest

754
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:34,000
signature stuff is specific to a given

755
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,190
target organization it shifts that lost

756
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,840
game calculus a little bit so in this

757
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,330
case we weren't interested at all in

758
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,040
having the above the fold CNN coverage

759
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,669
we were interested in causing the actor

760
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:48,399
pain so I think that went a lot into the

761
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,440
into the maybe they lost their accesses

762
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,360
I mean that was you know if anybody

763
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,290
comes from the offensive side like it

764
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,820
that's the hardest part of the whole

765
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,250
thing right is he built and getting your

766
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,389
initial one old so I mean the malware

767
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,890
side of things you have retooling

768
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,170
malware you can have a deaf guy do that

769
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,970
week you know or a team of deaf guys I

770
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,410
mean these guys had so many resources

771
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,090
available it wasn't really the

772
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,620
development of the new pool it was

773
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,780
gaining access is back into those

774
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,419
victims there's high-profile victims

775
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,910
that they had access for was one of the

776
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,530
big things from my perspective one of

777
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,700
the big things that helped the equation

778
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,740
was the fact that we've had so many

779
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,020
large partners that we were all informed

780
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,820
it was just one entity doing this then

781
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,750
nobody else knows and everyone's playing

782
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,610
catch-up we had 12 15 people all knowing

783
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,130
that this was going on all of which had

784
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,689
a huge proportion of industry as a whole

785
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,790
represented as their customer base and

786
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,590
then probably the final thing is over

787
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,990
analysis the Intel gain loss equation is

788
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:42,850
is a horribly detrimental thing for

789
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,040
everyone because while you're trying to

790
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:48,669
calculate that people are stealing your

791
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,110
stuff and everyone else's stuff there's

792
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,220
a line in there and I think it's

793
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,020
something we all have to struggle with

794
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,130
but there's definitely a line in there

795
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,100
in which you know you

796
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,980
get analysis paralysis and you end up

797
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,449
not actually doing anything because you

798
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,100
feel like you have these dies under a

799
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,330
microscope you can launch them all day

800
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,340
long they're still running away with

801
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,429
stuff we don't have a good way to judge

802
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,800
effectiveness metrics on effectiveness

803
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,140
of indicators across industry I'm a

804
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,850
Latino at approach that problem but like

805
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,000
I know that like you know indicators

806
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:21,100
against the lesser sophisticated groups

807
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,320
are definitely better because they reuse

808
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,090
situ and things like that but for the

809
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,919
more sophisticated groups you know the

810
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,419
more sophisticated they get the value of

811
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,880
the indicators becomes less and less

812
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,680
because they can think through our

813
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,540
perspective believe me an actor like

814
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,160
this is thinking about how the defenders

815
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,020
think and there's what we're doing like

816
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,400
what Paul was saying you know if I'm

817
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,139
going to take an action what's going to

818
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,860
be their reaction these guys are

819
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,000
definitely thinking about that so it's

820
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,330
interesting you mention a do you want

821
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,010
report so the calculus and the Intel

822
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,960
game loss there was more yeah these guys

823
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,850
are clowns so releasing everything we

824
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,170
know about them can cause them serious

825
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,810
pain because they'll have the ability to

826
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,040
retool deployed malware as quickly

827
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,440
effectively as some of the more advanced

828
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,790
group so here we have a group that's hot

829
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,370
on the other end of the spectrum for

830
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,480
Chinese apt groups where the calculus

831
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,699
was made hey we want to cause these guys

832
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,530
pain but what we saw from our

833
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,270
perspective is the new back doors were

834
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,649
being deployed into existing victim

835
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,870
environments as this was happening

836
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,120
fairly quickly very yeah you're right

837
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,520
and the new back doors were armored

838
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,280
their more advanced memory only like

839
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,730
they stepped it up incredibly deadly so

840
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:30,430
in from my perspective unless it's a

841
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,420
total shutdown which I wanted to go back

842
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,650
to the slide where you guys were talking

843
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,680
about the detection for the certain

844
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,960
families I'll go back some of those

845
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,960
families like when I see I to rugby plug

846
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:44,500
X they're used by like a wide variety or

847
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,900
after so what was your guys calculus on

848
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,190
I guess I kitchen particularly the one

849
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,350
that's the most well-known through this

850
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,800
group how much of that infrastructure

851
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,300
that was detected and remediated was

852
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,100
actually being using active intrusions

853
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,680
how much of that was actually at victim

854
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,418
companies versus hot points was any kind

855
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,549
of that

856
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,679
was any of that kind of figured out

857
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:06,600
after action just because from our

858
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,450
perspective and I know a couple other I

859
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,070
are responders organizations there it

860
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,669
wasn't even a blip like we saw any

861
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:19,439
malware and they just kept rolling yep

862
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:21,179
so hike up the Sox family and probably

863
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,190
one more in there which is dis keeping

864
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,830
me at the moment we knew the majority

865
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,080
vote for Activision they were so closely

866
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,309
tied with this particular actor that it

867
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,879
really wasn't any way that we could have

868
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:35,340
associated look what we did see on one

869
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:37,498
victim side and you bring up a great

870
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,019
point and that's something that I

871
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:41,369
personally in vessel with because coming

872
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:45,659
from an intelligence background like

873
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:47,939
don't show your hand right but the

874
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:50,820
victim in particular I'm thinking of it

875
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,470
took care of you know not eradicate them

876
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,529
but it at least slowed them down it

877
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,659
stopped bleeding to allow them to gain

878
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:59,970
control over their visibility of the

879
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,159
actor it basically decreased the

880
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,049
aperture and it let them focus on where

881
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,259
these guys still persisted because they

882
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:09,299
were so prolific for their network um so

883
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:11,999
you know there was a little bit of game

884
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:13,970
there but again it didn't eradicate them

885
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:18,090
I mean these guys have so many tools

886
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,950
we've seen them recently just you know

887
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,799
come in one way throw something over

888
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,179
there back out of here go over there you

889
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,509
know I mean their lateral movement is

890
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:29,309
fantastic so I don't know if we'll ever

891
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:30,840
get rid of that all right I want to move

892
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:34,710
on I'm sorry I want to move on to the

893
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,749
next question okay so it's I guess kind

894
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:40,499
of a summary can you expound on the

895
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:42,869
impact that using SPICE separate Inca

896
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:45,090
structures had on sherry and what can we

897
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:47,850
do going forward to make sure we avoid a

898
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:50,189
spam assassin kind of scenario and then

899
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,019
another question is actually I think it

900
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,720
would be good for this audience to maybe

901
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:56,070
elaborate on some of the problems with

902
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,299
having too many people in the room

903
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,460
because I don't think you can assume

904
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,950
everybody understands

905
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,270
oh yeah sure from the separate

906
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:06,080
infrastructure we actually had this

907
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:07,850
problem from our from our aspect you

908
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,440
know you have like Zach said you have

909
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,730
any asian customers you have customers

910
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,350
that are paying you to you know help

911
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,210
them protect their networks and do

912
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,770
things like that at the same time we're

913
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,659
trying to accomplish this overall goal

914
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:22,009
so there were things that were not

915
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,449
released publicly there were indicators

916
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,100
out there that weren't because of that

917
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,870
very thing is that it would be giving

918
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,750
away victimology and things like that at

919
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:31,940
the same time we did go to the customers

920
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,710
and ask them to actually participate or

921
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,780
the Vic impression say and they were

922
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,889
actually part of the group so so they

923
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,620
approved the sharing of the information

924
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:43,069
amongst the group as far as too many

925
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:44,359
cooks in the kitchen I think so that's

926
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,710
that's kind of a fun one I mean the

927
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,040
logistical issue of having too many

928
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,889
cooks in the kitchen to spot the we we

929
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,509
we ended up having to revert back for a

930
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,060
lot of the coordination of the group is

931
00:34:53,510 --> 00:35:02,270
whole back to email and effectively

932
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:05,570
public notepads and and that worked but

933
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,040
there was something there I think I

934
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,020
think it also goes kind of back to your

935
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,790
planning and your what like what's the

936
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,280
objective of your campaign and then

937
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,870
who's essentially your your voltron that

938
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,970
you want to attach to it and the

939
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,740
different phases of that operation like

940
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,939
certain people will be in a supporting

941
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,890
role and some people will be in a

942
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,530
supporting role some people might be

943
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:27,200
doing something directly operationally

944
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:30,200
and then maybe shifting over to you know

945
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,839
reporting later on when someone else

946
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,370
picks up another phase the operation

947
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,790
being able to kind of coordinate a play

948
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:39,410
a playbook or a plan and adhering to

949
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,060
that plan when it does make first

950
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,790
contact with the enemy because it will

951
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,200
fall apart but to you know a certain

952
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,330
degree you at least have that and you

953
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,149
put together kind of that process and

954
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,250
prepare people for that

955
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,460
the fertility the first casualty of war

956
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,750
is the plan yeah there's quite a few of

957
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,640
those so you brought up a good point not

958
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,930
everybody can be the black line right if

959
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,940
somebody's got to get a little blue line

960
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,549
over here on the left arm right so it's

961
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:06,700
about knowing your role and play nicely

962
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:08,440
with others and at the end everybody get

963
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,700
their slice and you know well I mean

964
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,650
that was that was definitely dip then we

965
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,480
didn't have anyone tried to try to you

966
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,279
know take too much legal to take the

967
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,960
glory kind of things like that I mean it

968
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:19,119
always everyone was everyone was there

969
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,770
willing everyone was moving towards the

970
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,289
same mission and I think more than

971
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:26,740
anything else having everyone be on

972
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:28,900
board with the overall objective yeah

973
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,339
nobody tried to hijack it for PR I think

974
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,200
what I think we should all be really

975
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:34,538
proud of that oh so that's actually my

976
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,700
question the marketing game lost for

977
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:38,170
this you all work for vendors right and

978
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,210
how do you as the analyst on the front

979
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,369
because vendors are using these reports

980
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,990
for marketing right so there's there's

981
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:45,670
like I know that is a good example of

982
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,049
course I knew me no vetta was before but

983
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,779
I think a lot of people outside of this

984
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:51,730
area learn for you guys were so as of

985
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:52,809
guys on the ground running this you know

986
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,609
the benefit to shut down this

987
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:56,529
infrastructure how do you battle the

988
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:58,058
marketing folks within your vendor

989
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:59,440
organizations that see this as an

990
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:02,650
opportunity to increase the brain

991
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,150
increase sales it's like you know you

992
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,319
don't if you screw this up once you're

993
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:08,020
not going to be invited back to the

994
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:10,299
table so like value of the opportunity

995
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,940
and you know selfishly we had the

996
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:15,160
opportunity to learn and watch how you

997
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,079
know an organization or multiple

998
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,750
organizations collaborate distributed

999
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,339
way trying to get get you know this type

1000
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,099
of analysis out of email out of

1001
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:27,038
spreadsheets and being able to get it

1002
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:29,920
into a common area that you can then act

1003
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:33,730
on it quickly was was you know our our

1004
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,070
selfish is just not necessarily promote

1005
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:38,080
lights

1006
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,970
no I don't think so at all I think I'm a

1007
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,970
from a practical context to answer your

1008
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:45,580
question no vetas chief marketing

1009
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,109
officer spoke with every other marketing

1010
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,930
department of everyone else and I think

1011
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:51,550
that that kind of encapsulates why there

1012
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,589
wasn't a big marketing war at the end of

1013
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:56,470
the day we had people who spoke a

1014
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,930
language speaking to their counterparts

1015
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:02,379
who spoke the same language and that

1016
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,399
works out really well I think and and up

1017
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,840
there on the board right now we have a

1018
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,340
bullet point that says you know the tear

1019
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,260
sheets the Rosetta Stone the post after

1020
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,150
surveys help presenter coordinated front

1021
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,500
net that's what it comes down to every

1022
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:15,580
single technical person to every single

1023
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,860
marketing individual all upper

1024
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,020
management's got pre-formatted tear

1025
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,670
sheets that told them this is what's

1026
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,440
happening this is the plan this is who

1027
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,030
your point of contact is this is who

1028
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,510
your technical person's point of contact

1029
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,670
is that the communication helps a lot a

1030
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,370
bottle of correction for my marketing

1031
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:36,220
department and we actually carved up the

1032
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:38,080
PR stuff between different organizations

1033
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,060
involved with it like we all know kind

1034
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,620
of made sure we had the same talking

1035
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,360
points in terms of you know this is

1036
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,339
about cross-industry oh this is about

1037
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,410
interdiction about causing the actor

1038
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,270
pain this is about showing that you know

1039
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,520
we can work together with an industry to

1040
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,920
you know share information without you

1041
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,070
know if being all about creating another

1042
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,900
white paper that the sales guys can use

1043
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:01,210
and we all those same talking points and

1044
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,530
we all went to went to went out with

1045
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:07,690
them and and I mean I think most of the

1046
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,850
people in the group did some kind of PR

1047
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,100
effort but it was what was white PR

1048
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:14,259
effort and and frankly from a marketing

1049
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,750
perspective this stuff is more useful to

1050
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,760
organizations like mine when I'm having

1051
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,070
one-on-one conversations with people

1052
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,890
like you than it is when it comes to

1053
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,420
email blasts and things like that

1054
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,490
because most you look at like you know

1055
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,590
review the paper people like us knowing

1056
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,200
what's going on right the typical you

1057
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:35,110
know buyer decision-maker type person

1058
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,359
has no freaking idea what a TPP is in a

1059
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,950
lot of cases or at least the first

1060
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,359
people you're reaching there's like one

1061
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,999
person any given working as a

1062
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:46,269
asian of smaller size that actually gets

1063
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:47,618
this stuff so I think that's one of the

1064
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:49,359
takeaways we got to figure out ways to

1065
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:53,769
do these kind of efforts that don't

1066
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:56,109
involve being marketing we we had a real

1067
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:59,589
quick though I'm at one point we did

1068
00:39:56,109 --> 00:40:01,598
have internal frictions I I had to hit

1069
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:03,880
my PR guy up and just be like well sit

1070
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,349
down you know listen this is for the

1071
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,989
better good we'll get our time

1072
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,940
eventually and will follow suit the

1073
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:13,150
bigger friction problem that we had

1074
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,579
internally within our company was here's

1075
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:20,170
a big list of indicators that we sell as

1076
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:22,869
a product and how can we justify giving

1077
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:25,269
away intellectual property that's what

1078
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:26,920
they call it on the outside too you know

1079
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:28,959
a collective group where some of them

1080
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,059
included competitors for example and

1081
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,680
that was the bigger friction point that

1082
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:35,049
we had entirely was getting bad

1083
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,720
authorizing proves to basically say okay

1084
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:39,730
it's better you know in long run so

1085
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,098
we'll do it that's a very difficult

1086
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,660
process for us at leads to go through

1087
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,839
all right I want to move on to the next

1088
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:49,029
question here and talking about bringing

1089
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:50,769
pain to the adversary I wondered if you

1090
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,630
had ever contemplated doing anything

1091
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:54,910
like a misinformation campaign or

1092
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,589
counterintelligence and maybe even

1093
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,839
working with the FBI to do some kind of

1094
00:40:56,589 --> 00:41:00,670
title 18 type of thing Oh deception is

1095
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:03,099
one of my favorite things the world of

1096
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,960
intelligence I don't think we actually

1097
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,730
ever you know thought up any kind of

1098
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,009
misdirection strategies or anything like

1099
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,589
that but no that's that's a worthy area

1100
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:13,779
to think about in discuss because I mean

1101
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:16,299
I think that deception in misdirection

1102
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:19,299
is probably one of the most under

1103
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:21,279
underutilized schools in our toolkit

1104
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:23,349
these days as far as our craft ales

1105
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:25,210
because i know i've used misdirection

1106
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:26,680
deception against adversaries when i've

1107
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,710
been dealing with them and found it very

1108
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,769
effective like you know trying to i'm

1109
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,539
going to say kill chain like trying to

1110
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:36,640
make the adversary know that they're

1111
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:38,289
getting to see to every time when you're

1112
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,420
catching them and delivery and those

1113
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:43,600
kind of things on a tactical level on a

1114
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,340
strategic information warfare level

1115
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,170
we haven't really done anything and

1116
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,550
that's an interesting area explore I

1117
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,590
think that's one of those things we need

1118
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,570
to carefully consider before we begin to

1119
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:55,420
walk down that come in advance move the

1120
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:57,100
fact that we like all like good like

1121
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:01,210
answer the phone together entire shoes

1122
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:03,160
was like you know all right that was a

1123
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,110
good question exhibition yeah my

1124
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,549
questions come on the similar line that

1125
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,490
I was just wondering when you plan the

1126
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:12,670
operation did you at all sort of develop

1127
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,740
a concerted strategy to try and drive

1128
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,990
the access to a place we had more

1129
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,390
visibility of their activities to try

1130
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:22,509
and minimize that through Intel loss

1131
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:24,819
games I'm portabellas part we didn't do

1132
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,320
any hurting we had a handful of partners

1133
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,940
that we knew what compromise already had

1134
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,740
his ability in there we didn't attempt

1135
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,570
to hurt the actors any further if we had

1136
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,850
tried to do that I think that there's

1137
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:35,290
there's a concern that if you touch the

1138
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:38,140
actor too much he'll figure out that

1139
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:40,150
you're there and you'll lose that one

1140
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:43,089
big punch that you get from being

1141
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,980
coordinated ever 11 item that I thought

1142
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:47,290
we could have done better if I can kind

1143
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,740
of highlight that is like these terms of

1144
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:52,450
their structure like again from like a

1145
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,000
diamond methodology standpoint there was

1146
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,990
a huge emphasis on capability and there

1147
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,450
wasn't really much done on the

1148
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:00,160
infrastructure side where perhaps with

1149
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,890
more time or resources something like

1150
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,149
that could have been done or at least

1151
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,160
just eradicated the entire

1152
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,810
infrastructure and burn all that but

1153
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,920
there were I mean there were some

1154
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,020
logistical issues their their their

1155
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,730
focus on compromised infrastructure

1156
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,870
would have been I mean we've been all

1157
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,610
over the place you're right i mean

1158
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,020
haven't had more time there was problems

1159
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,850
there are probably wait for that but i

1160
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,590
think some of their practices about

1161
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,180
burning their own infrastructure when

1162
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,160
they were done with the campaign yeah

1163
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,720
what it boiled some of those i'll be

1164
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,250
waiting in their own infrastructure when

1165
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,959
they realize somebody's investigate oh

1166
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,420
god yet yeah i think i think this is a

1167
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,480
matter of execution maturity as well

1168
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,730
right so as I kits better than will be

1169
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,720
able to execute on some of those more

1170
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:43,540
advanced options same buddy done a table

1171
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,910
top of using game theory to identify

1172
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,930
what the next set of patterns that are

1173
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,569
obvious

1174
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,879
in this process mylink that's what I

1175
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,580
think about individual companies and

1176
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,730
whatnot I know have but I don't know

1177
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:05,210
about or our group and itself have no

1178
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:06,770
idea but that's good idea so sorry but

1179
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,750
you guys again I think at the end of the

1180
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:11,390
day given how quickly we saw them

1181
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,610
rebound and the effort involved in your

1182
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:17,000
in the collaboration do you think it's a

1183
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:20,180
net win dependably all you answer it

1184
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,210
yeah I'm going to answer it from like

1185
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,819
the fact that like operationally like

1186
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,130
that was a win like that we were able to

1187
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:33,740
you know plan to a certain degree and

1188
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:37,940
execute you know against common a very

1189
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,709
common plan that that was a win the fact

1190
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:42,080
that you know they're they're still

1191
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:44,210
persistent they're still really good I

1192
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,060
think just highlights that you know

1193
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:49,100
maybe the resources that they had you

1194
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,660
know how motivated they are to continue

1195
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,880
doing this sort of thing like I mean

1196
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,259
maybe the effort needs to be larger next

1197
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,770
time or resources I mean I don't know

1198
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,330
what what adding two people to that one

1199
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,770
seventy-five percent you know I don't

1200
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,410
think we're there yet but we need to do

1201
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:05,960
these enough times to then be able to

1202
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:08,089
like answer an affirmative i'm gonna i'm

1203
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,530
going to actually kind of a scam or

1204
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,510
specific question along the same lines

1205
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:15,860
of you guys which is how do you how do

1206
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:21,410
you measure rebound so you know you've

1207
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:23,660
got a problem right and you take some

1208
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,299
steps right stimulus response you cause

1209
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,399
some effect right that effect has a

1210
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:32,750
certain duration so time of course is

1211
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:36,650
one right but maybe what is what is the

1212
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:39,290
measure for rebound and you know what

1213
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,870
does that look like right now right so

1214
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:45,800
how far have they rebounded since then

1215
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:48,770
and you know i think i think that's kind

1216
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,520
of the one of those measures that bear

1217
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:53,330
is getting at is is you know

1218
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:57,780
if we can met if we can see what that is

1219
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:59,880
we can gauge success and then tweak the

1220
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,560
execution or you know the operation

1221
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,030
according so I think I think that's

1222
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,100
something that obviously we need to we

1223
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,300
need to do we're collecting it down to

1224
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,890
partners that we know we're compromised

1225
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,690
are sending us still some data in

1226
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,480
telemetry and we've obviously got the

1227
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,980
eight the larger a be partners reporting

1228
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,080
that you know they've had X number of

1229
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,850
mediations material like that I agree

1230
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,380
that we need to have published something

1231
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,819
a little deeper so we've got a more

1232
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,560
fine-grained understanding of exactly

1233
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,650
what's going on material along those

1234
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,330
lines this was the first time we add

1235
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,650
this kind of framework and these people

1236
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,390
all together so there is a maturity

1237
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:31,910
question there which I think will get

1238
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,540
better as we as we do the next one

1239
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,940
responding back to some of the original

1240
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,370
question if a man is robbing my neighbor

1241
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,470
it is in my best interest to try and

1242
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,870
help my neighbor out if that man comes

1243
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,029
back it's still in my good interest to

1244
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,470
go back again at some point these are

1245
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,780
not these are not one and done

1246
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:51,330
operations these are ongoing efforts

1247
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,610
just because just because they can come

1248
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,160
back with you no more tools behind them

1249
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,630
and they can adapt to us we can adapt to

1250
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,089
I mean they're working with the same

1251
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,880
flesh and blood we are the interdiction

1252
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,490
is cumulative right now you know we took

1253
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,290
out a you know one set of tools that

1254
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,729
they were using and they clearly have

1255
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,890
the ability to roll in other set of

1256
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,750
tools and then we squeaked and we try to

1257
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,490
affect their set of tools we've got to

1258
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:17,010
kind of keep this operational tempo

1259
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:20,970
going right because at a certain point

1260
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:23,250
there their effort in order to retool

1261
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:26,100
starts to go up because we know these

1262
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:28,710
guys will prepare to retool but how long

1263
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,140
can you keep them retooling before their

1264
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:33,300
operational costs start to get

1265
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,370
prohibitive enough to where they have to

1266
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,500
shrink their target set and I think

1267
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:39,240
that's the big thing if we if they if we

1268
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,400
can take them from a situation where

1269
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,979
they are actively maintaining 500

1270
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,950
targets down to only being able to mean

1271
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,800
250 active targets that's the point

1272
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,939
where we're starting to get a week a

1273
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,040
serious way and that's why we've got

1274
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,950
pushing this kind cooperation and so

1275
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,050
just an hour

1276
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,310
operational practice to they can come

1277
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,410
back and do now and that's one thing but

1278
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:02,140
I know what their playbook looks like

1279
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:03,220
I'll just find them again right so one

1280
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,500
thing I want to we're going to move on

1281
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,390
to the next question here but one thing

1282
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,970
we need to I think begin considering is

1283
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,170
in these metrics not necessarily the

1284
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,299
amount of infrastructure they've

1285
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:16,359
accessed how many infections things like

1286
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:19,960
that how many organizations that that's

1287
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:21,670
the real gauge in my mind of impact does

1288
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,810
not I'll be your infrastructure is but

1289
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,790
if you've got 500 host and they're all

1290
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:27,430
in the same company really the impact is

1291
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:30,490
one it's the to that company its major

1292
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:35,078
but awkward questions so how did you

1293
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:37,419
guys identify the victims so there were

1294
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,920
a couple ways some of us actually had

1295
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,560
personal relationships with victims

1296
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,589
reflection for other partners in the

1297
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,960
coalition they were customers so there

1298
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:49,750
was a monetary relationship there when

1299
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,410
when remediation information started

1300
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:55,300
coming back the ecosystem the the

1301
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:57,490
ecosystem partner whoever owns

1302
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,430
remediation information they kept their

1303
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:02,348
own telemetry so so we do actually there

1304
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,569
is a number somewhere or how many how

1305
00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:06,520
many organizations were affected how

1306
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:09,609
many organizations have been worked with

1307
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,930
I can't give you a directed improve I

1308
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:14,049
can't give you a specific number for

1309
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:16,299
that mostly because my AV partners might

1310
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,920
be under some kind of NDA which says you

1311
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,050
cannot in any way shape or form reveal

1312
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,670
anyone who has been affected some of our

1313
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,319
av partners were only able say we saw

1314
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,400
seven different companies and that was

1315
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:26,319
the only information that could get us

1316
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,869
or verticals right nothing like that

1317
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,240
that that is that is kind of a sticky

1318
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:32,619
when when working with a large group but

1319
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,720
you have to be able to respect that kind

1320
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:36,400
of NDA and at the end of the day they're

1321
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,529
still able to give us a thumbs up thumbs

1322
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,810
down if something else for this did in

1323
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,540
fact have a mediated effort we saw this

1324
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,790
this was a this was a win in terms of we

1325
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,170
need something stall somewhere yeah and

1326
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:48,880
we have no reason to distrust those

1327
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,890
partners because if it didn't have an

1328
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,780
effect they would be giving us a thumbs

1329
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,279
down and we ain't ya we're not so

1330
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,530
interested in resource and you know

1331
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,560
allocating as many resources for this

1332
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:00,820
Ted it's been by all accounts they want

1333
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,600
to come back they want to come back

1334
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,120
around you hi can you comment on any of

1335
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,170
your interactions you had with

1336
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:12,250
government departments agencies whether

1337
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:14,020
it's DHS or FBI or or what the role of

1338
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:16,660
the government should be is kind of

1339
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:19,150
industry lid so we get this question a

1340
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,310
lot at least everybody says was Ellie

1341
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:23,200
involved was got involved or they pissed

1342
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,990
off that you dumped all this Intel out

1343
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,210
there right I mean really the big

1344
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:31,359
problem is when you work with a

1345
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,980
government entity or Ellie one of the

1346
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,810
main outcomes of this was to share data

1347
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,990
was to get the word out and to get

1348
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:39,730
people to understand what's going on

1349
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:42,160
when you have a government entity

1350
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,350
involved there's a lot of other nba's

1351
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,759
they have to worry about and you know

1352
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:48,460
you can't share this can't see that

1353
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,010
whatever so the decision was made I mean

1354
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,380
initially was to do this through private

1355
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:56,290
industry Ellie was aware of what was

1356
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,120
going on the right players knew what was

1357
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:02,110
happening they may not have been happy

1358
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:04,029
about it and from our perspective some

1359
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:07,150
of those people are customers so we have

1360
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:09,670
to confiscate that line too but you know

1361
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,440
I mean there's not the images to having

1362
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:14,470
this done in three months do it yeah but

1363
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,150
exactly have been a year yeah or 45 we

1364
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,799
would all night record for quite some

1365
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,240
time yeah and at the other data to get

1366
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,750
out of the back they get notified there

1367
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:25,259
were victims yeah for some of them but

1368
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:28,470
they were they were not a directed

1369
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,470
you're aware

1370
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:36,880
you keep saying the word NDA like it's a

1371
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:39,160
bad thing and it could be is it time to

1372
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,050
bring in the legal counsel on the

1373
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,230
executive assistant decision makers and

1374
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:46,660
rethink the way we do ndas in light of

1375
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:48,400
what your lessons learn where to to

1376
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:51,009
allow for better collaboration in the

1377
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,570
future I feel like we had a big problem

1378
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,910
no there wasn't really that big of an

1379
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:56,740
issue honestly if I even remember many

1380
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:59,049
red lines flying back and forth it was

1381
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:01,299
pretty you know let's get the mmvas up

1382
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:03,370
lets you know and on top of it I think

1383
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,810
you know the circle of trust like I

1384
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,730
think played a big role because you know

1385
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:08,350
coming in I say hey you know top

1386
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,850
priority for me is you know protecting

1387
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:12,130
my customers you know I don't want

1388
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:14,290
anything here that identifies custom

1389
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:16,150
can't happen and everyone's like okay I

1390
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,250
agree that was more important than any

1391
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:20,410
of the NBA's but yeah I don't remember

1392
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,360
much red line activity the NBA is I

1393
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:25,240
personally myself the NBA helped me

1394
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,980
pitch this to our boss and say hey we're

1395
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,740
covered it's okay you know if somebody

1396
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,540
messes up we can go after it's a

1397
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,839
protection everybody looked at the whole

1398
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,860
NDA think the same that way right I

1399
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,710
think part of the challenge there though

1400
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:41,080
is at measuring your success in

1401
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:43,600
aggregate form with those NDA's in place

1402
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:46,210
how many organizations to do impact how

1403
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,100
many verticals you impact etc and with

1404
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,750
those in DA's in place if you have to

1405
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,940
obfuscate that and I'm not saying that

1406
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:55,660
it's it's it's improper or should be

1407
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:59,370
different but it creates challenges in

1408
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,370
gauging your successor

1409
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,760
yeah I mean that's one of the reasons

1410
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,740
that some of the ecosystem partners

1411
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,420
don't want to be identified they don't

1412
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,310
want their customers coming up and going

1413
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,530
hey you know we were dealing with this

1414
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:18,450
act or were you share an info and that

1415
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,950
kind of thing and I think that's kind of

1416
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,540
acceptable I mean working in this game

1417
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,430
you get very used to the idea that

1418
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,930
sometimes people are going to tell you

1419
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:27,450
information you're going to have to take

1420
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:29,069
it on face value based on the degree you

1421
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,049
trust that person and their information

1422
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:33,210
has been correct in the past yeah and

1423
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,070
we're used to that and you're putting on

1424
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,780
my Lockheed Martin sir pad there's no

1425
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:39,030
way we would let you guys reveal that to

1426
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,770
anyone else if you were you know we were

1427
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:44,700
working with you so it's it's a hard

1428
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:47,280
problem so can you give technical

1429
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:49,200
examples since you couldn't share our

1430
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,660
specific indicators because of specific

1431
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,129
infrastructure for a victim what kind of

1432
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:59,370
information do you share that allow

1433
00:53:53,130 --> 00:54:01,320
detection by other entities yeah some

1434
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,380
stuff that was action so some of it was

1435
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:06,360
actionable and not action right like

1436
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,580
some of the some of the domain names for

1437
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:12,000
example we had had victim information

1438
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,650
right and publicizing that overall will

1439
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,620
just simply serve to shame the victim

1440
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,730
for no good reason don't we can um

1441
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,990
regarding specific material that we

1442
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,670
share when we release the reporting

1443
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:22,649
release the whole pile yarra signatures

1444
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:25,080
we released a pile of a couple of other

1445
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:27,360
bits of information snorts signatures I

1446
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,520
think the individual partners themselves

1447
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:33,030
obviously made or whatever modifications

1448
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,259
they needed to for their own everyone's

1449
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,150
got a different way of doing their own

1450
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,130
signatures so all that one out if you're

1451
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:41,250
protected by pretty much any of the

1452
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:42,660
major AVS or ecosystem vendors you

1453
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,730
probably got a signature in there for

1454
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,020
our stuff every single one of them that

1455
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,610
we worked with published some kind of

1456
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,650
blog saying yep we're part of this

1457
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:51,510
effort this is the threat this is the

1458
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:54,300
specific ID number regarding our

1459
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:57,000
remediation strategy inside of our

1460
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,160
product this is where it is no there was

1461
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,620
a lot of very actionable things

1462
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,960
published to everyone and all kind of

1463
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:06,089
going in place and it's roughly the same

1464
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,720
exact period of time yes today is kind

1465
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,790
of impressed

1466
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,919
it was like a 48-hour window for

1467
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:13,200
everybody in the average here's the

1468
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,690
indicators and I mean like some of the

1469
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,669
things is like with hike it and when you

1470
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,930
guys are going to have to crack probably

1471
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,400
correct me but there's you know the

1472
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:22,500
malware portion is kind of a config file

1473
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,020
porsche Ryan and the config file

1474
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,000
identifies victims right so we would

1475
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,609
hold that stuff back but push out the

1476
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,410
indicators for the rest of the pile you

1477
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:34,049
know out there and the domain name

1478
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:35,640
example is really good I I mean did we

1479
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:39,119
actually we actually had victim

1480
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:41,700
notifications involved yes acton was

1481
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,830
actually part of the collaboration so it

1482
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,379
was at their request to not release that

1483
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:48,660
domain but honestly speaking that domain

1484
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,609
is one of its very very very few things

1485
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,470
yeah it was only useful to them it did

1486
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:53,700
them exactly that can only apply to them

1487
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:56,759
and we didn't have applied to a logger

1488
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:58,529
rd college audience about it yeah

1489
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,030
because I mean we deal with that from a

1490
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,710
vendor perspective is will get you know

1491
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:04,020
intelligence all the time that's not

1492
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,150
stuff that we can just baked into the

1493
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,190
you know the indicators that go out in

1494
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,840
the product but like we can say oh you

1495
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:11,040
got a customer over there as affected by

1496
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,900
that and that's when you know we

1497
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,330
actually pick up the phone and go hey

1498
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,950
got some you know kind of Intel here you

1499
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,000
might want to call the FBI and ask them

1500
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,069
about this thing here's the guy who

1501
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,780
knows about it so you know that that

1502
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:24,210
kind of thing is happening more and more

1503
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,619
in the industry and I think that's you

1504
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,810
know a part of being a good partner with

1505
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:29,520
your customers you know sometimes those

1506
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:31,589
situations are going to rise and you

1507
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,970
know you just don't bury all right I

1508
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:35,240
think we got time for maybe one or two

1509
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:35,240
more questions

1510
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:41,580
guys decide to do this again for your

1511
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,080
collaboration all right inside what are

1512
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:45,060
there different targets you ever worried

1513
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:49,049
and the fact that you're publicly

1514
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:51,870
speaking about every day essentially big

1515
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:53,670
adversary that could have extensive

1516
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:57,200
resources yeah yeah I'm the target

1517
00:56:53,670 --> 00:57:00,720
painted on your back let me take this

1518
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,819
all right so I I spent a lot of time

1519
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,799
studying China and whatnot I've traveled

1520
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,250
extensively to China I have been

1521
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,320
shaoling climb Mount song my kungfu is

1522
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:13,500
strong i paid my respects to the dharma

1523
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:17,520
booty and you know I've spent extensive

1524
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:20,490
time operating overseas and a large

1525
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,340
chunk of it after I have been a very

1526
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:25,770
public figure in the you know the

1527
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:28,260
counter apt community the one thing I

1528
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:30,000
will say because I actually I actually

1529
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,260
genuinely like the Chinese people and a

1530
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,550
lot of things about Chinese culture I

1531
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,990
have a lot of issues with their

1532
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:39,600
government but they are very plut about

1533
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:41,069
the way they play the SPR they're very

1534
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,290
polite about it in fact when i'm there

1535
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,850
on tourism I've never been screwed when

1536
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,170
i'm there on business my hotel really

1537
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,110
gets tossed and all that kind of stuff

1538
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:51,210
so like the polite obey the visa rules

1539
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:53,790
if you go to China on a tourist visa

1540
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:56,280
don't do business that you you will you

1541
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:59,070
will catch hell but they're very polite

1542
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,750
about it so I think in terms of our

1543
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:02,040
engagement we've got to be perfect we

1544
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,450
got to be careful with the personal

1545
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,720
attacks and stuff like that because i

1546
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:08,970
can change real fast but i wouldn't need

1547
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,770
to worry about it we are if you ever

1548
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:12,660
hear me as furiously gonna kill it

1549
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,190
overseas way we're mari where's your

1550
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:16,920
best honey where's your best honey pot

1551
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:18,090
for espionage information okay i would

1552
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,100
assume that you're not going to go after

1553
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:21,960
any russian state sponsor so if you

1554
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,299
don't get the polonium oh that's a

1555
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,010
different water cup of tea so we're

1556
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,280
gonna look at this to china it goes

1557
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:31,290
after by a perfect yeah that goes actor

1558
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,880
by actor I mean that is a valid point

1559
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:34,870
though honestly when you're doing this

1560
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,910
you have to you have to weigh that

1561
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,200
and actually you know kind understand

1562
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,520
are these guys going to kind of play by

1563
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,910
the rules or these the ones that will

1564
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,110
like burn the house down and you gotta

1565
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,899
you gotta think about I'm just going to

1566
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:48,520
retire when their backers get out of lab

1567
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,680
great I think vironment right good I

1568
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,730
think we're pretty much we're pretty

1569
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:57,399
much out of time so on that final

1570
00:58:54,730 --> 00:59:00,160
somewhat amusing Khaled I think our to

1571
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:09,630
wrap it up everyone please a round of

1572
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:09,629
applause for our panel here I'm going to
