now I feel good

2
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,390
it's like Chekhov's gun

3
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,940
which is one of the best archer gets of

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,370

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,370
I was gonna make the actual thing

6
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,960
against the check on Scott check naka

7
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,250

rest of the talks I've been excited for

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,430
all of the talks but I think we have a

19
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,740
good good closeout for the day just one

20
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,060
thing to mention after Scott and Kyle's

21
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,820
presentation here we're going to have

22
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,190
the vs solution sessions with eyesight

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,989
and tinium and then webroot the rooms

24
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,550
are accurate as far as what's in the

25
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,470
guide so pick which one you want to

26
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,320
attend and go to those rooms so without

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,940
further ado take a gentleman alright

28
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,980
welcome back from lunch hopefully you're

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,410
not too asleep even go to too much of a

30
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,760
coma before we get started want to make

31
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,700
sure that we understand a little bit of

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,359
who we're talking to so for those of you

33
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,359
who feel like you identify for us coming

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,060
from more of an Intel type of background

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,700
raise your hand just whatever that means

36
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,190
to you alright if you feel like you come

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,149
from an infosec or incident response or

38
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,800
a UNIX neckbeard background okay so it's

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,769
about evenly split would you say that's

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,510
yeah okay good Intel heavy little Intel

41
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,910
heavy but you know we're DC what's gonna

42
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,220
happen you know okay so what we're going

43
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,010
to talk about today is is really kind of

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,269
focused between both ways between both

45
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,600
groups as where I was here last year and

46
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:10,330
really kind of spoke more to my fellow

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,700
you know infosec into their response

48
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,989
types about the intel analysis process

49
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,959
and this year it's a little bit more

50
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:18,190
balance between the two i think so so

51
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,200
we'll introduce ourselves a little bit

52
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:25,060
you know I'm Kyle Maxwell I am a

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,220
sysadmin who got pulled into responding

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,860
to incidents who now suddenly find

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,609
myself doing threat Intel and so forth

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,739
at I defense I'm Scott Roberts I work

57
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,630
for a little t-shirt and sticker company

58
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,630
called github we do a little good

59
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,220
hosting on the side as well and I do

60
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,609
Incident Response threat intelligence

61
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:49,359
dig into whatever maliciousness there is

62
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:51,270
so twitter is kind of the new tender for

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,200
bromances

64
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:58,170
so Scott and I met on Twitter somehow I

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,510
really don't remember how and we became

66
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,220
good friends that years and years ago

67
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,810
and we've been looking for an

68
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,100
opportunity to you know work together

69
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,470
and do stuff together ever since and

70
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,859
today is kind of the opportunity with

71
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,050
that said our good friend Alex Pinto

72
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,450
presented yesterday and he probably

73
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,880
beats us in wanted t of animated gifts

74
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,039
but he also had a hashtag for his talk

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,659
and so we have a hashtag for our talk so

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,780
we need to beat him and the number of

77
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,880
tweets using our hashtag so if you're on

78
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,070
the twitter i'm at kyle maxwell he's at

79
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,630
s Roberts please feel free to tweet

80
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:38,610
throughout the talk with the Yolo threat

81
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:43,010
hashtag which of course means you ought

82
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:46,050
to look out right um with that said also

83
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,420
please don't feel the need to hold your

84
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,460
questions until the end you can if you

85
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,220
want to but generally speaking you know

86
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,950
please feel free to be interactive

87
00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:00,000
dynamic ask us the questions we will

88
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,260
almost never say hold that if you know

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,030
if it's going to be answered on the next

90
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,010
slide we might but generally speaking

91
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,690
you know we like to engage with it right

92
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,640
then mostly because you'll forget or

93
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,620
will forget the question and the moment

94
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,039
will go by with that said I'll hand it

95
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,010
over to my bro here Scott let him go so

96
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,970
I'm for all of you who raised your hands

97
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,460
that you come out of the intelligence

98
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,230
community i'm super jealous by the way i

99
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,440
wanted to be a spy growing up i watch

100
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,310
way too much james bond as a kid and so

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
when this whole threat intelligence

102
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,550
thing became a big deal i thought all

103
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,010
good it's my chance to be a computer

104
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,750
nerd and a spy at the same time which

105
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,750
thankfully most people i know believe

106
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,640
which is great so i ended up doing a lot

107
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,990
of you know introduction to intelligent

108
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,940
stuff and this is an intelligence

109
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,690
centric conference so i thought i'd go

110
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,730
over a little bit of the basics so we

111
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,669
use a lot of words interchangeably that

112
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,160
shouldn't be data and intelligence or to

113
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:55,830
two big ones data is a piece of

114
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,210
information that you have that might be

115
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,950
relevant to something you're working on

116
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,140
intelligence is something that's gone

117
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,500
through the intelligence process does

118
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,479
everybody know the intelligence process

119
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,919
this thing which when you say

120
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:13,568
something's intelligence you're going

121
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,919
through this process correct but at some

122
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,240
point when it comes to operations you

123
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,289
need to find a way to mix these two

124
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,449
things together how do you combine

125
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,969
security operations the dfi our stuff

126
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,219
Kyle and I come from and intelligence

127
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:27,879
and what we found has really worked in

128
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:31,330
in the past is this this f3 EAD model so

129
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:33,340
is anybody familiar f3 ad some some

130
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,240
people can't say if you know about it

131
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,039
that's fine f3 ad actually came out I

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,639
don't want to get overly military in

133
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,650
person i'll appreciate that a forces

134
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,360
methodology for for kind of combining

135
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,068
intelligence and operations at the same

136
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,430
time which is what Kyle and I are really

137
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:53,979
about so fine fix and finish is the

138
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,930
operations portion identify something

139
00:06:53,979 --> 00:07:03,219
bad you're going to go after hunt it

140
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:04,389
down and come to a conclusion and at the

141
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,979
same time you're conducting the

142
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,539
intelligence portion of it which is

143
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:10,029
exploit the intelligence you have

144
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,169
analyzed it to learn more and share it

145
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,020
with other people who are dealing with

146
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,758
the same problems and we're going to

147
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,169
kind of you know this this has been

148
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,060
talked about by a lot of people crowd

149
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,580
strikes done a lot of work with with

150
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,180
f380 so we're going to pose it in a

151
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,419
slightly different way so ours is all

152
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,279
about hunting and and the the talk is

153
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,139
the most dangerous game so we're going

154
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,330
to talk about targeting we're going to

155
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,580
talk about the hunt we're going to talk

156
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,680
about the kill not not to

157
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,500
euphemistically and then we're going to

158
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,729
talk about hunting stories so if you're

159
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,169
doing threat intelligence the first

160
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:47,378
question you really have to ask is how

161
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,419
are you targeting and for us this means

162
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,520
making a plan for collection you've got

163
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,139
to pick out who are the people that are

164
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,099
interesting to know more about who are

165
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:59,139
the groups and how do you define that

166
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,370
there are three big ways that I see you

167
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,770
have groups that choose their hunting

168
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,020
priorities based on actors based on

169
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,120
themselves as targets and based on the

170
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:11,409
technologies they have available which

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,630
kind of goes hand in hand the places you

172
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,880
get that information there's a number

173
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,110
and and one of the big ones that

174
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,900
everybody is dealing with right now is

175
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,669
feeds

176
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:26,270
who's consuming automated feeds actually

177
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:28,669
surprised how few hands that is feeds

178
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,440
have become kind of a de facto for a lot

179
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,110
of what is threat intelligence and

180
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,880
becomes a great place to start picking

181
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,320
who you're going to be looking for as

182
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:42,469
far as your hunt some kind of no-name

183
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:47,300
guy managed to make this point about

184
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:50,510
feeds and it doesn't necessarily have to

185
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:56,000
be that harsh but it does okay it does

186
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:58,670
if you're recalling but but feeds have a

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,190
lot of benefits but also have some

188
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,479
shortcomings which can be volume and

189
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,830
signal-to-noise ratio a lot of people

190
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,740
are talking right now about picking out

191
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,300
who to hunt based on honey pots I'm

192
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,300
going to keep doing this hand raising

193
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,800
thing by the way so enjoy who's running

194
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:21,680
honey pots right now for your for your

195
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,969
organization or personally okay there's

196
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,439
some great stuff you can get out of

197
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,990
honey pots but it's a really

198
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,970
differentiated issue we have what we

199
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,430
call low interaction honey pots you know

200
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,850
your listeners on hosts that are just

201
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:38,089
kind of taking in information passively

202
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,520
which are easy to get information but it

203
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:42,050
tends to be low value you know if you

204
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,880
have a low interaction honey pot and

205
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,199
you're literally researching every IP

206
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,010
address that tries to ssh scan you

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,740
christmas is coming and you're going to

208
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:54,230
be busy until then hi underage

209
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,160
interaction honey pots are also a little

210
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,839
bit more information centric but they

211
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,319
get really complicated as anybody tried

212
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:08,360
running a massive hi interaction honey

213
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,470
pot it gets dangerous very quickly and

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,060
it becomes tough to generate

215
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,410
high-quality or it becomes a good way to

216
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,229
generate high-quality intelligence but

217
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,520
it comes at a lot of risks there's some

218
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,990
great software out there for doing this

219
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,170
if it's something you're interested in

220
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,230
the honey net project and threat streams

221
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,459
modern honey network has been a really

222
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,290
cool project that's come out in the last

223
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:30,819
few months so that's actor centric if

224
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,410
you

225
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,089
to go to more of a target centric

226
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,419
approach you can base it on

227
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,829
vulnerability information but a lot of

228
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,269
people tend to take that a little bit

229
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:43,059
too far and while structured

230
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:47,699
vulnerability analysis is not threat

231
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,699
intelligence it is really important so

232
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,499
vendors also are publishing an

233
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:54,699
incredible amount of information about a

234
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:57,220
number of different you know

235
00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:00,279
technologies actors things like that so

236
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,739
I know Kyle and I have worked a lot on

237
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,589
pulling information directly from some

238
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:09,369
of those sources parking I ox that sort

239
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,720
of thing parsing I ox this gets to one

240
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:13,479
of my little asides since I know there's

241
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,429
a lot of vendors in the audience please

242
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:17,829
stop making PDFs I can't cut copy and

243
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:20,199
paste out of and please put and please

244
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,959
stop putting IP addresses in like pngs

245
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:25,988
and graphic formats that I then have to

246
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,910
like literally manually type in this

247
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:31,839
this is this has caused me a lot of

248
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:35,199
effort and so you know those are some of

249
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,350
the lower lower fidelity ways that you

250
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:40,209
can start going who are the actors who

251
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,419
are the groups we need to be watching

252
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:48,219
out for but we've missed out on one of

253
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:50,649
the most important ones dad did I not

254
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:55,299
leave that up long enough come on give

255
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,769
it a minute in the end we think that by

256
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,749
far the most important way to generate

257
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,829
who are the people you should be who are

258
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,659
the threats you should be most concerned

259
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:03,909
with where is the place that your hunt

260
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:07,479
should begin is this idea of reviewing

261
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:08,949
your own incidents I know so many people

262
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:11,529
who've spent an incredible amount of

263
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:14,858
money on a big fancy shiny vendor

264
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,689
unnamed incident management system and

265
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:19,289
have never gone back and looked at any

266
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:23,469
of their past incidents after the fact

267
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:25,389
and that's just beyond unacceptable and

268
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,399
missing out on one of the best places to

269
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,109
start your hunting experience if you

270
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,519
want to know who's after you the people

271
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:33,309
that you know our app view is a good

272
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,650
place to start the guy chasing you might

273
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:39,680
be after you in fact

274
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,390
and more than that let's let's take that

275
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,729
a step further and maybe review the

276
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:50,120
incidents for other people who are in

277
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:51,860
your fear your vertical I wouldn't want

278
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,410
to name any names but if you have a

279
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,150
target on your back perhaps it's other

280
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,250
people in that that kind of vertical

281
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,040
should be looking at what those people

282
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,690
are dealing with that's too slow too too

283
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,910
subtle no I think that was not too so

284
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:10,490
okay good so with that said so once

285
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,040
you've determined what it is that you're

286
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,590
looking for and you still haven't found

287
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,849
what it is you're looking for now you

288
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,050
start thinking about how you're going to

289
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,150
do it well you start thinking first

290
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,390
about sources of technical information

291
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:27,110
what am I going to analyze as part of

292
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:30,560
what I'm doing well I always mentioned

293
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:33,530
because I like to say it my buddy David

294
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,599
Bianco who's now at squirrel talks about

295
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,990
the get ready for it the Pyramid of pain

296
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,810
right the Pyramid of pain is really a

297
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,210
simple concept which is that the easier

298
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,069
it is to gain some information that's

299
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,190
also the easiest information for the

300
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,540
actor to be able to change so the

301
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,190
easiest thing in the world to get our

302
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,900
hashes right those are everywhere it's

303
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,040
really easy for a threat after to change

304
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,110
their hash but it's a place to start

305
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,020
right here are some hashes or something

306
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,420
that we know is bad ok this is there are

307
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,280
it's something right what are some

308
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,319
sources for this stuff well virus share

309
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,600
of course virus total we're going to

310
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,540
mention them a few times today malware

311
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,320
com which is a great site that needs to

312
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,760
buy a vowel but it's real with the tech

313
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,350
and the front end is really great it's

314
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,420
from the guys who do cuckoo sandbox and

315
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,520
all of that once you have some

316
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,530
interesting malware perhaps somebody

317
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,020
share with you some hashes you go and

318
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:33,140
you can find a sample that matches that

319
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:36,590
hash right and you will say well what am

320
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,120
I going to do with this now it's much ok

321
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,350
you can go scan your enterprise for that

322
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,640
hash and that's not really going to be

323
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,800
that useful to you because somebody

324
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,630
flips one bit and half of the average of

325
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,060
the bits and the hash flip and you're

326
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,340
looking for my totally different but you

327
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,079
can get most of the value of

328
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,290
reversing from some really simple stuff

329
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,600
look you may not have somebody who can

330
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,880
spend 10 hours a day in ida pro and take

331
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,770
this stuff apart if you do great those

332
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,740
guys those folks are really sharp at it

333
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,300
but maybe all you want is some basic c2

334
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,580
information what does it call out to

335
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,079
maybe you get a little bit of developer

336
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,210
artifacts that are still in there

337
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,040
somebody you know didn't strip debug

338
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,920
symbols from their malware or you know

339
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,420
something equally a name okay I'll black

340
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,089
out they just leave comments in there

341
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,260
just plain text well court i saw that

342
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,470
kaspersky says you can attribute

343
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,430
everything based on that okay okay so I

344
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:31,160
was talking about a movie fair enough so

345
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,469
passive DNS is for me personally the if

346
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,530
there was only one tool i could use

347
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,710
passive DNS would be it pasadena is

348
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:42,890
really simple in content it is recording

349
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:46,520
the dns responses between servers that

350
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:49,220
you see for later use what resolve to

351
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,199
what at what time okay there are a

352
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,590
number of different places to get it

353
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,920
that have slightly different foci and

354
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,570
how they and how they do it dns DB from

355
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,130
Farsight you know they've got some folks

356
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:07,240
here they have a really extensive really

357
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:10,160
broad database from a bunch of different

358
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,040
organizations that contribute in DNS

359
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,050
data right and a long history of that

360
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,420
data so you can say show me all the

361
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,880
names that resolve to this IP and you're

362
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,920
going to get a pretty good sense of the

363
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,980
different names at different times that

364
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,500
ever resolved that IP or vice versa

365
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,150
passive total is more collaborative a

366
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,130
lot of researchers kind of shared data

367
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:33,860
they get different data feeds and

368
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:37,520
there's a you know some tagging and some

369
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,870
collaborations so for example i love

370
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,460
looking at address and find oh that's a

371
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,340
sinkhole that's why i'm seeing all this

372
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,500
stuff here and then virustotal of course

373
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,910
is going to be very malware focused so

374
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
every time they get a sample and they

375
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,959
run it through their behavioral analysis

376
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,060
and they do a dns resolution they record

377
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,620
that so then you go later on look up a

378
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,229
domain or an IP address and i say oh

379
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,630
that was associated and these days with

380
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,960
this these malware samples for example

381
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,410
super useful in many many ways when

382
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,530
you're in

383
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:09,199
skating infrastructure who is data um

384
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,760
the the good folks at domain totals

385
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,329
domaintools talked about this yesterday

386
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:17,030
a little bit it's really easy to get

387
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:19,698
current who is data it's tough to get

388
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,439
historical who is data which is what you

389
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,880
really want I can't tell you how many

390
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,860
actors have made you know we talked

391
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,870
yesterday about OPSEC fail at oops a

392
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,939
quick Brian Krebs right how many actors

393
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,678
originally registered their domain name

394
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,090
with their real name and address and

395
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,150
they're like oh crap i need to put on a

396
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,600
privacy guard well great but you know we

397
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,890
already can can go look that up those

398
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,959
sorts of things you also want to do

399
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,690
ongoing tracking okay i know these

400
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,850
actors like these tlds i want to track

401
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,590
it over time you can either keep doing

402
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,689
the lookups every day which is a pain or

403
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,209
you can use a tool like who dat or one

404
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,309
of those for doing your kind of ongoing

405
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,309
tracking okay so those are technical

406
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:00,620
indicators right what about actor

407
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:02,870
information well this varies a little

408
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,959
bit now when we talk about the type of

409
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,939
actors the type of adversaries that

410
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,690
we're talking about if you're talking

411
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,340
about criminals and in this particular

412
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:17,059
context hacktivists kind of falls under

413
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,559
the same rubric um honestly your best

414
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,049
weapon is Google and for those who don't

415
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,010
believe it go ask ross ulbricht right

416
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:27,440
now what he thinks about literally the

417
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,809
way he was found initially was a google

418
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,039
search ready to a domain name before a

419
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,720
certain date in other words it wasn't

420
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,390
just you know type in a search term add

421
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,390
a few operators and bam oh look here's

422
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,760
this guy with his real name starting up

423
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,640
this site what could that be tracking

424
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,559
social media you know Brian Krebs talk

425
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,330
yesterday again about this right all

426
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,950
these guys have their Twitter and

427
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,350
Facebook accounts and you can get a lot

428
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,789
of good information from that and

429
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:57,709
Facebook in particular I've had great

430
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:59,840
success with oh look this guy he's smart

431
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,580
enough not to use his real name but this

432
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,100
is his girlfriend and this is his mom

433
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,110
and this is his cousin across town now I

434
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,500
know a lot more about him and that

435
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,030
triangulates very quickly occasionally

436
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,220
you know over the years hear people talk

437
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,428
about tracking underground forums right

438
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,440
criminal forms

439
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:17,700
another area that krebs investigates

440
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,909
because this is the area where he's

441
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,249
tracking actors right those can be full

442
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:26,610
of really great information it also

443
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:29,340
takes a lot more work right to be able

444
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,168
to do this so I would never recommend

445
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,389
that somebody start here this is where

446
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,490
you get when you know the sorts of

447
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:37,229
actors that you're looking for you may

448
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,389
even know some specific folks that

449
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,210
you're looking for and then you can have

450
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:44,928
you know somebody or a vendor or what

451
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,490
have you focus on this stuff this is

452
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:48,690
high value but also a lot of work to

453
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,490
extract it it's kind of like you know

454
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,289
cracking open like lobster a crawfish

455
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,269
right the meat really tasty bits a lot

456
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:55,408
of work to get to that meat was really

457
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:57,690
wonder where you're going with that food

458
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:00,360
food you're the foodie that's logical

459
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:04,499
and with that said now Scott who thinks

460
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,240
that he's James Bond in a hoodie I hear

461
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:07,379
that's coming up in the next movie sweet

462
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,820
I'll tell that was the girl to dragon

463
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:13,110
tattoo anyway so my background more

464
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,639
comes out of the Espionage side of

465
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,860
things we're tracking actors

466
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:18,840
specifically can get a little bit more

467
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,449
complicated simply because they tend to

468
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,369
have a little bit better OPSEC so in our

469
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,440
case we find that most of your ability

470
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:27,289
to track an actor is based on you know

471
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,480
the malware you actually find and

472
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:32,158
reversing that the the things they do on

473
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,499
a system if you're lucky enough to get

474
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,470
you know command shell usage things like

475
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:39,570
that sometimes who is register our data

476
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,940
can give away some i believe the apt one

477
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,759
guys had made some mistakes early on

478
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,230
that but the most important thing from

479
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,090
from that perspective is really the

480
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,700
actions over target where I've been

481
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,799
tracking groups of bad guys from an

482
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,929
espionage side most effectively it's

483
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,059
more been who are they going after and

484
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,240
what are they trying to get to and kind

485
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:02,460
of correlating those actions over target

486
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,129
versus mistakes they make an ongoing

487
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,720
basis because those groups are more

488
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:09,090
likely to be deploying new pieces of

489
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,559
malware new exploits things like that

490
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,879
right so as you're dealing these

491
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,820
different sort of actors you kind of

492
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:17,759
have to in this sense ass in that

493
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,080
pyramid of pain right because you can't

494
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,019
because you're not going to track

495
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,090
sophisticated actors just via hashes you

496
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:26,220
need you need to track how they do what

497
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,879
they do what they're targeting you know

498
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,559
the things that really at the pinnacle

499
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,629
the stuff that's the hardest and may be

500
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:34,329
impossible in some cases for them to

501
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:36,458
change also is more work on our end as

502
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:38,829
defenders right to track that and with

503
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,449
that how do you keep tracking this

504
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:42,039
information okay this is great I've

505
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:46,299
pulled together some really useful

506
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:49,239
information it's all in PDFs and it's

507
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:51,459
all in my head and maybe if my in my

508
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:54,190
private get repositories or what have

509
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:56,499
you right um how do you track this okay

510
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,329
so threat libraries there are you know

511
00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:01,569
some open source solutions right crits

512
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:03,969
from the fine folks at mitre right miss

513
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:05,918
P is another one that's a bit more

514
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:09,129
malware focused but you know kind of

515
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,319
exists in the same area it for some for

516
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:13,299
some shops lighter solutions like

517
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,239
literally wiki pages right with some

518
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:18,639
wiki templates Scott has that the

519
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:20,259
pathways right or go to for a long time

520
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:22,329
right and for some things that works

521
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:23,679
really well there are a lot of vendors

522
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,969
in this market some of them are here you

523
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,309
know there's some that are doing good

524
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,509
work and kind of iterating the space you

525
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:30,940
know threat connect us here you know

526
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:32,289
I've used their tool you know they're

527
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,239
doing some good work making good

528
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:36,639
progress there there are others that are

529
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:38,019
kind of starting to address this but

530
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:40,508
there's a lot of room for growth a lot

531
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:42,549
of group because nobody in our selves

532
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:44,919
included right even really understands

533
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:46,418
what we want yet much less how to build

534
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,429
that right and so it's you've got to

535
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:51,579
kind of figure that out if you're

536
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,729
tracking over time as well things on the

537
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:57,999
internet if anybody here has used scum

538
00:22:54,729 --> 00:23:02,709
blur anybody has anybody heard of scum

539
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:05,919
blur has anybody heard of Netflix okay

540
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:07,690
so netflix prop to them yeah the one

541
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,599
that you know is that I watched my

542
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:13,359
chromecast every night released an open

543
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:16,269
source tool that they use its kind of if

544
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,039
you will a meta search engine so for

545
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,829
example I go set up a Google custom

546
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:23,709
search I set up several of them actually

547
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:26,259
I go give the API keys to my scum blur

548
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:27,669
instance and then I tell it I want you

549
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:28,809
to keep watching for these things over

550
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,309
example I have a Google custom search

551
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,259
for all the different pay sites i can

552
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,959
find and i look for certain keywords and

553
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,949
it shows up in my scrambler engine

554
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,959
recorded future that just spoke before

555
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:40,629
lunch right they do you know they're in

556
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:41,530
kind of a similar more or less area here

557
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,540
obvious it's a lot more

558
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,649
refined than all the extra work that you

559
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,020
would have to do in scum blur but

560
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:50,260
regardless you're going to have to do at

561
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,879
least some level of custom development

562
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,710
because you're you're focusing on

563
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,970
whatever the targeting is that we talked

564
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,010
about at the beginning whether that's

565
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,960
for your organization your technologies

566
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,790
for specific threat actors that you're

567
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,350
that you're hunting what have you as

568
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,210
well as how you want to integrate this

569
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,620
data into other things do you want to

570
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,780
use the hits you get off of a system

571
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,449
like this to block things directly to go

572
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,639
into a sim to go into log management to

573
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,170
just send it somebody an email right and

574
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,430
and that remind me of that you pointed

575
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,960
that out because this works alongside

576
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,400
another tool they have called sketchy

577
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,410
there's a bunch of different tools that

578
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,030
do it sketch is the one that works best

579
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,340
with scum blur but you can find others

580
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,410
and the idea is it takes screenshots of

581
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,000
websites automatically not that you have

582
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,340
to pull it up in your browser but you

583
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,780
feed this tool list of URLs and it comes

584
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,179
back and it says here the screenshots

585
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:38,590
this is great for example for evaluating

586
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:41,140
Possible's fishing lure sites right so

587
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:44,620
in that context it does a great job for

588
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,210
that if you're looking for malware virus

589
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,000
total is the King here they're not the

590
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,200
only player but they are the the biggest

591
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,750
and baddest and if you're not at least

592
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,240
including them you're missing so much

593
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,980
stuff there are a lot of other malware

594
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,470
feeds that you can go with custom

595
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,330
internal development there's open source

596
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,080
stuff you can do so mal tree of a tool

597
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,429
that I wrote that is basically a crawler

598
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,260
for finding malware edges to being

599
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,030
served today you can feed that into

600
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,160
cuckoo for some automated dynamic

601
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:14,920
analysis Viper from the same guy who

602
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,480
same folks who wrote cuckoo as sort of a

603
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,770
malware storage thing and then you may

604
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,710
have you know different sorts of

605
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,720
commercial things as well as you're

606
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:27,820
doing your hunting you don't just want

607
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,180
to hunt externally right so as as anti

608
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,570
jovica and I talked about a lot together

609
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:38,410
log management is important log analysis

610
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:40,480
it matters way more log management is to

611
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,950
make your auditors happy log analysis or

612
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,900
so you could do something with it right

613
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,690
so you want to go look in your firewall

614
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,090
logs your IDs logs your proxy logs for

615
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,590
stuff related to what you're hunting but

616
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,600
don't just think about those things

617
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,230
right your perimeter network devices are

618
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,540
important

619
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,630
but think about your web server logs

620
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:01,570
your mail server logs yeah they're a

621
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,799
pain to read send mail logs but you send

622
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,620
mails a pain in a lot of ways in on its

623
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,410
own of DNS logs oh my gosh imported

624
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,120
right authentication and audit so for

625
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,470
example anybody ever worked on a case

626
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,229
where it may be you can't region and I

627
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:18,580
understand where owa logs were super

628
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:20,830
useful if you haven't you should go look

629
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,120
at your owa logs because I guarantee

630
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,889
there's something in there right now for

631
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,250
your number whether that VPN VPN logs

632
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,960
anything that's remote access right um

633
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,640
with that said the whole goal of this is

634
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,340
to get to doing the gathering

635
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
information is great and it's fun and it

636
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,090
might even be a hobby as you sit at home

637
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
at night because you don't want to rate

638
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,290
a world of warcraft anymore you just

639
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,110
like hunting this stuff so the whole

640
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,580
goal is to get the internet response

641
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,370
what do we mean by that right the whole

642
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,809
idea is no I don't just mean reaction

643
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,428
right there's also because we're talking

644
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,710
now about actively hunting down

645
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:56,650
adversaries and not waiting for somebody

646
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,990
to call you and say um I see a strange

647
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:01,720
screenshot on all my desktops everywhere

648
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,160
can you come look at it yeah right you

649
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,230
want to see Brian Krebs up here on

650
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:09,190
speaking not writing an article about

651
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,660
your organization right so the first

652
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,900
thing it could get confusing because

653
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:16,809
sometimes as you find stuff you don't

654
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,530
want to let them know that you know that

655
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:22,090
they know that you know that it starts

656
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,220
to feel like from the princess bride but

657
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,350
the other idea is that it's sometimes

658
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,559
it's better to kind of spend some time

659
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,689
and gather some more information to

660
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,000
assess the full extent of what you're

661
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,700
looking for right the full extent of

662
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,610
what they've done now the question

663
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,820
always comes up yeah but who was it I

664
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:45,250
don't mean was it you know hurricane

665
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,168
panda or whoever right would you know

666
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,990
legitimately you want to have some level

667
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:51,669
of understanding of who but was it this

668
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:55,840
specific in do you know what is the guys

669
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,549
name where does he or she live probably

670
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,100
the specific who doesn't matter unless

671
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:03,908
you could be this right if you can

672
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:06,100
actually go after the actual individual

673
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:09,429
with you know handguns and

674
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,500
cars and Ronald Reagan driving our so

675
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,700
it's the license plate Liberty that you

676
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,710
probably can't read that's what's

677
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,289
particularly great to me yeah so Ronald

678
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,120
Reagan in in a muscle car with the

679
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,710
handgun through the windshield not

680
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,070
looking back at the explosions it's

681
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,770
great as Scott likes to say this is this

682
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,289
should be attributed to Scott instead of

683
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,090
to me is unless you can use handcuffs or

684
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,129
cruise missiles on somebody it probably

685
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:38,439
doesn't matter their specific name and

686
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:39,760
location but fair yeah yeah as we said

687
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,740
sometimes it's better to spend some time

688
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,780
just watching for a while and getting

689
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,929
some information the reason that some

690
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,970
level of intra beauty is that you can

691
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:51,039
say okay once we believe that this is

692
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,440
linked to this particular threat group

693
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,150
what else do we know about them all we

694
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,720
know that they also do this sort of

695
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,700
activity and we know that they also use

696
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,400
this infrastructure well now I have more

697
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,809
stuff to go look for whereas before if

698
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,330
you had cut it off immediately before

699
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,309
you understood anything about them you

700
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,960
haven't really accomplished anything

701
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,399
because now they're just going to kind

702
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,409
of you know hide a little bit a little

703
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,409
bit more yes Bertha

704
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,390
Scott you wanna take that sure I mean

705
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:30,409
the question was where does attribution

706
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:34,960
fit in with what a group is after in in

707
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:37,070
my experience I mean groups have our our

708
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,809
very few groups are just compromising a

709
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,000
network just to get a foothold and call

710
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:42,710
it a day there are groups obviously that

711
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,929
do that but it's rare in most cases

712
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,370
there's an objective and you may have

713
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:48,529
four or five different groups attacking

714
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:51,469
your organization all with wildly

715
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:54,169
different objectives and so in in many

716
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,760
cases we can see a new piece of malware

717
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,289
deployed in the environment something

718
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,600
we've never seen before a new fishing

719
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:01,490
lure new everything and then we see them

720
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,100
try to access the same person that we

721
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,659
saw three campaigns ago and at that

722
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,500
point you start to be able to identify

723
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:12,080
changes in TTP's when they don't end up

724
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,240
changing their goals and so that becomes

725
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,399
just one one aspect of attribution and

726
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,590
that too and to kyles I'm going to make

727
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,100
you do it the Pyramid of pain they're a

728
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,439
bit of a uh it turns out that if a

729
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,570
groups interested in stealing widget

730
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,770
plans they can't suddenly decide to

731
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,840
change their malware change their

732
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,418
exploits and change the fact they're

733
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,980
after widget plans that that's just the

734
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:36,500
toughest thing of the pyramid of pain to

735
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,120
change for any actor and once you do

736
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,799
some level okay we believe it's these

737
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,479
actors you have an interesting of the

738
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,580
sorts of things they might do and what

739
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,919
you need to prepare for the sorts of

740
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,529
kids who are typically doing DDoS

741
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,870
attacks for example may make a bunch of

742
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:53,929
fish but they're frequently usually

743
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,399
don't have the capabilities to say drill

744
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:57,950
into your credit card database for

745
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,270
example or what have you if the Syrian

746
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,140
electronic army gets into your twitter

747
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,940
account versus panda whoever they're

748
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,289
going to have two wildly different goals

749
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:11,020
as to what they want to do with that

750
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:13,700
level of access so to that point right

751
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,590
we talked about Intel driven response is

752
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,450
so traditionally writing infoset we

753
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,928
think about deny pull the plug on the

754
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,149
hack server you know add a firewall rule

755
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:25,100
take the server offline reformat it

756
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:26,959
reinstall and put it back on and never

757
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,709
understand what really happened that is

758
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,570
certainly one way to do things but you

759
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,370
may want to think about other things

760
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,439
to do sir eventually you want to do a

761
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,879
denial right eventually you do need to

762
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,130
kick them out and safeguard your

763
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,710
infrastructure before you may do things

764
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:45,860
like feed them fake data and see what

765
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,740
happens this so not just an i deceived a

766
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:52,428
grade disrupt and eventually well you

767
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,590
can't I can't you can't why not but are

768
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:56,179
you the military should know are you the

769
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,408
intelligence community definitely then

770
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:01,850
you really can't do that okay fair

771
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:03,649
enough so what I can do hopefully is

772
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,199
where it's appropriate where it makes

773
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:08,809
sense work with law enforcement for

774
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,759
example and let them follow their their

775
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,230
process and you know if they can go give

776
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:13,850
somebody a shiny new pair of handcuffs

777
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,250
we deserve it and finding a pair of

778
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,750
silver bracelets great but you can in

779
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,299
the meantime you can certainly try to

780
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,879
deceive then there's nothing that says

781
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:24,740
hey I see this connection i see this

782
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:26,750
account logging in i'm going to feed

783
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,549
them some fake dated written direct them

784
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:32,149
to some you know to a honey pot or other

785
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:33,830
fake infrastructure try to if anybody

786
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:36,500
remember his years ago the tool called

787
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,689
park it right that was just supposed to

788
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,340
just slow down their connections and

789
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,389
make them you know i will ferrell says

790
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,009
the best way you can get to know

791
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:45,439
somebody is to see how they react at a

792
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:46,820
slow internet connection and i really

793
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,480
want to see that when it's my adversary

794
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,379
who's like why is this taking so long

795
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,740
and eventually of course you know

796
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:56,870
disrupt which is you know in similar but

797
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,090
not identical to deny right the idea

798
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,399
being that you're trying to you know

799
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:04,009
find ways to interfere somehow with

800
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:06,049
their operation someone's ftp doubt 36

801
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:10,340
of 37 RAR files and you cut off the last

802
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:14,570
one mid transfer or you give them a zip

803
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:17,059
bum that it's a you know 100k file that

804
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,769
expands to four terabytes let sir those

805
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:21,610
are great interesting ideas I don't know

806
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:24,919
that I would ever seen anybody do that

807
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,610
it doesn't destroy any anybody right

808
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,500
doesn't even to show their

809
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,029
infrastructure it may you know fill up a

810
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,860
hard drive the point the point with not

811
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:33,350
talking about destroy is whenever you

812
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,879
talk about active response the first

813
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:38,990
thing everyone wants to jump to is hack

814
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:41,139
back and the fact is that's not really a

815
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,580
legitimate answer for most organizations

816
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:45,889
and the few that it is a legitimate or

817
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,250
you know option for already know about

818
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,540
it

819
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,710
they're probably doing it already and

820
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,760
they're not they're not taking advice

821
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,930
from the other publisher okay the other

822
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,570
thing that you can do is communicate

823
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,490
with other folks right who can make use

824
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,370
of this enforce you got to ask yourself

825
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:05,420
who else needs to know about this right

826
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:06,800
so for example you know there's a lot of

827
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,810
folks probably hear from financial

828
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:13,070
services financial institutions right

829
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:15,529
you never see banks call each other out

830
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,179
publicly about security right well you

831
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,409
should come to that bank got robbed the

832
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:20,418
bank across town got robbed yesterday

833
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,889
you'd be much safer take it all your

834
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:23,270
money out of that ax coming to us right

835
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,520
because they have a vested and

836
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,000
legitimate interest in the public

837
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,090
trusting in the system right believe

838
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,879
that okay overall banks are overall

839
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,290
secure so in general financial

840
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,509
institutions share threat information

841
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,460
because they might be competing on you

842
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,129
know interest rates and for underwriting

843
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:47,418
the new IP or whatever but they're not

844
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:49,040
compete in terms in these sense um also

845
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:52,790
who might be able to provide additional

846
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,870
information to me right so it might be a

847
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,699
whole different organization might even

848
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,410
be a competitor right it may be an

849
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,029
organization that I have no relationship

850
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,230
with but I know that they're they're

851
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,060
involved they don't even know they're

852
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,070
involved yet but hey if I can work with

853
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:07,460
them then maybe we can share some some

854
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:09,050
logs or whatnot so so all that gets into

855
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,790
this idea of hunting stories which is

856
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,100
how do you talk about these compromises

857
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:15,440
you identify these actors you identify

858
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,200
an all that and and discuss them after

859
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,910
the fact and so the the two big

860
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,230
breakdowns are the idea of products and

861
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,629
the next one will get to his audience

862
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:27,080
and so that the big products will talk

863
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:30,640
about our IOC's and rfis short term

864
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,930
products and then long-form products and

865
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,859
before you even get into that the next

866
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,410
thing you got to consider is your

867
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,580
audience if you've ever written about an

868
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,080
incident you've had written about a

869
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,520
threat actor you have to treat things

870
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,200
completely differently whether you're

871
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,259
talking to other members of your

872
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,629
security team peers who might understand

873
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,040
what you're dealing with inside your

874
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,890
organization I think this is a really

875
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,110
underserved topic in our community of if

876
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:56,680
you have a breach what do you say to the

877
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,640
people inside your own organization

878
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,649
because when you don't give them a

879
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,240
message

880
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,290
tend to make one up on their own and

881
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,970
that might not be what you're looking

882
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:10,690
for so one of the first ones is IOC's

883
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:13,000
and this has become a really important

884
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:16,300
thing and it's a really hard problem how

885
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,900
do you describe these wildly generalize

886
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,850
large large issues in a formulaic way

887
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,770
that you can share between multiple

888
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,480
people programmatically god I'm just I

889
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:30,580
just can't that like I think that that's

890
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:32,470
all and the two big products for talking

891
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:36,569
about iocs right now in a generalized

892
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:39,310
way are obviously sticks and open IRC I

893
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:41,650
like both these projects I like what

894
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,920
they're trying to accomplish I know

895
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:46,870
they're both moving forward in good ways

896
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,090
but as a friend of mine put it the XML

897
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,100
issue is kind of hard to deal with and I

898
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:54,570
know that this is a doubt of the weeds

899
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,950
but it's you know there yeah Jarrah the

900
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:00,400
sticks team I know specifically is

901
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:02,200
working to improve a lot of this up but

902
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,250
but the one of the tough things is

903
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,230
whenever we get to talk about this we

904
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:08,860
just start getting frustrated you go I

905
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,360
can't really stand the XML thing or

906
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,880
anything else something else about it

907
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,380
bothers you and and the one thing I'll

908
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,870
say is then we all start talking about

909
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,370
we should just write our own we could

910
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,960
totally do a better job it would be

911
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,180
great I'm gonna go start a new repo on

912
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,530
github and the right that's all I mean a

913
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:28,629
repo is all right so that being said we

914
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,250
support I'd at least personally support

915
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,620
the products that are out there and want

916
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,850
to see them improve because they are one

917
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,859
of the best ways to share this

918
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:39,089
information that can be used in multiple

919
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:42,160
sources from a more specialized level

920
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,080
everybody writes snort cigs and

921
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,299
basically everything reads snort cigs

922
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,980
and from a network perspective it's

923
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,980
become a really great way to share this

924
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,710
information Yara's kind of a newer up

925
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,900
comer on the specifically on the malware

926
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,400
space but has started to add all kinds

927
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:02,230
of things I think Moloch will let you

928
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,700
use it for network flows yeah oh I got

929
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:08,350
you on that one you did I did not know

930
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:10,049
that I know that volatility now supports

931
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:13,480
it for memory objects things like that

932
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:16,180
and your is great because it gets you to

933
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:20,800
use my company which is even better well

934
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:22,299
it doesn't have to well get pulls so

935
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,590
then you've got you know those are your

936
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,230
ways of formatting this information

937
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,940
you're going to be sending along the the

938
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,000
easiest way to pass this information

939
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,980
other people is this idea of an RFI so

940
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,260
your boss comes to you and says hey I

941
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:38,410
heard about this new group are they a

942
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,480
problem for us the RFI is a short you

943
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,670
know couple sentence response that that

944
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,710
answers that email your q3 stock analyst

945
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,619
says what do we know about this specific

946
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,480
you know set of domains let's find out

947
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,830
some information about it but yeah and

948
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,890
these are things that should be short

949
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,029
and turned around fairly quickly for

950
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,819
most people what they'll eventually

951
00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:00,700
start working on is longer form short

952
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:04,050
form products which are you know call it

953
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:06,279
a page a couple paragraphs discussing

954
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,810
information to support an incident

955
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,310
response and the intelligence you've

956
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:13,930
generated through there and your blog

957
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:16,150
post maybe a blog post for very few but

958
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:19,509
but not nonetheless really important are

959
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:22,090
the longer form products these are going

960
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,280
to be multiple pages encompassing all

961
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,859
different types of intelligence as

962
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,850
anybody not at a vendor generating these

963
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:31,960
on a regular basis not edit on oh we

964
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:35,410
should talk later I'd be curious about

965
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,940
that um these are hard these take a lot

966
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:42,480
of effort that they can be really useful

967
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:45,310
especially at a strategic level and so

968
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,359
we promise to cipro well we've talked

969
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,700
about doing a little bit of a surprise

970
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,279
and the fact is you only live once you

971
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:55,569
only live once Kyle and I have been

972
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,100
working on something for a while and

973
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:59,250
we've talked about it a lot and decided

974
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,009
this seems like the best place to

975
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,900
release what we've been working on and

976
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:08,940
so I always like to say you can't

977
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:12,160
download a threat intelligence till now

978
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,950
welcome we're starting a company called

979
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,940
yellow threat you can go to our domain

980
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:23,490
yes it is a domain that 80 is real we're

981
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,490
just coming out of start up I'm sorry

982
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:30,220
okay so apparently we're actually out of

983
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:35,170
money so we're going to be going back to

984
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:37,660
our original jobs but uh we have

985
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:40,480
released some stuff on yellow threat a

986
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,190
collection of docker images that will

987
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,559
basically stand up a number of open

988
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:47,109
source tools that are really useful for

989
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,710
an up-and-coming threat intelligence

990
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:53,558
team getting started so we're going

991
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:56,170
there there are some we've created the

992
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:59,200
darker fires us ourselves right Moll

993
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,390
trees combine the other tool that Alex

994
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,509
talked about yesterday that we released

995
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,890
last year of some we wrote a docker file

996
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,869
and found somebody else had a better

997
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,240
docker file and we said well what

998
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:13,170
instead we focus on being kind of docker

999
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,828
librarians about a lot more mature

1000
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,079
longshoreman there are the docker

1001
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:19,900
containers you know the container ship I

1002
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:22,150
don't okay that didn't work okay the

1003
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,849
idea of being like okay somebody has

1004
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,700
done a really fantastic job of putting

1005
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:29,980
together an elk doctor for elasticsearch

1006
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:33,970
well what is it less elastic search log

1007
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:37,599
stash Cabana that that thing a thug for

1008
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:40,000
example from which is a kind of a honey

1009
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,670
client for web requests right is there

1010
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,230
is a great tool has tremendous

1011
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,520
dependency problems well you know what

1012
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,940
let me back up for a second how many

1013
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,410
people here know what docker is wow

1014
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:53,170
that's way more hands-on I was expecting

1015
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,839
for the for the other 75% that don't

1016
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,640
write docker is I'm going to

1017
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,660
overgeneralize here and this applies

1018
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,180
mother was like no no that's not

1019
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,279
accurate it's close it's a little bit

1020
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,549
more than a package think like a you

1021
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:10,000
know like a Deb or rpm or msi file a

1022
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:12,788
little bit less than a full vm okay um

1023
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,760
and so you have this container that has

1024
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:18,640
just the the information it needs to run

1025
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,119
an app and runs inside a container

1026
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,950
within dr. in particular is fairly linux

1027
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,319
specific there are other similar tools

1028
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:29,890
if you're a freebsd person you know

1029
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,538
freebsd jails solaris zones it's the

1030
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,720
same kind of thing this is just linux

1031
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:36,460
pacific so all you do really is you do a

1032
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,868
docker pull

1033
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,900
a name like you know a Remnick / viper

1034
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:45,099
and then you run it and it's done all

1035
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,200
the stuff where your thug has so many

1036
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:49,930
difficult dependencies and special

1037
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,439
patches to apply that Lennie's else are

1038
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:54,669
you know announced on a recent sands

1039
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,170
webinar that he was releasing some of

1040
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,420
this stuff which was great because I was

1041
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,730
like oh man half the stuff I had started

1042
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:03,520
I could just like RM desh RF but we use

1043
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:05,260
it Lenny's instead so thanks man so

1044
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,670
these are essential useful recipes for

1045
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,609
getting these sometimes hard to get up

1046
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:11,560
and running pieces of software up and

1047
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:13,270
running really really fast so if your

1048
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,290
boss comes in on Thursday and says hey

1049
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,690
we really should have a threat

1050
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:21,790
intelligence capability by Monday this

1051
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:24,310
might be a great place to start so to to

1052
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:28,690
kind of summarize it did you have

1053
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:32,230
something else to say Yolo Yolo to

1054
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:33,849
summarize you know we talked about how

1055
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:36,220
to identify the targets you're most

1056
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:37,869
interested in some different processes

1057
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,220
for working through gathering

1058
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:41,820
information about them and kind of

1059
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:45,040
starting your incident response cycle

1060
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:47,170
intelligence specific incident response

1061
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,940
and then how to talk about things after

1062
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,550
the fact and you know we bombed a

1063
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,810
company you know everybody has got to

1064
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,480
have that one right it's like your

1065
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:56,950
starter startup right well if you hadn't

1066
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,390
had that caramel macchiato this morning

1067
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:02,589
we wouldn't have used up our five dollar

1068
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:05,640
starbucks gift card from Drake any

1069
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:08,020
additional questions i love questions

1070
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,720
feel free to say you know i think you're

1071
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:13,349
wrong about this yes sir speak up i

1072
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,348
repeat the question

1073
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:42,190
so this is gets to the a fuse to use the

1074
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:45,549
term for the long special forces acronym

1075
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:48,010
a 23 e80 that one so it's two mil speak

1076
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:50,560
for me I'm a neckbeard so you have these

1077
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,690
two parallel tracks right and they feed

1078
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,240
back and forth right so it shouldn't be

1079
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,619
you have a cycle and then you hand

1080
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,209
information off the internet responder

1081
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:00,520
and then they come back with questions

1082
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:03,369
right they should run in parallel so as

1083
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,930
the as the the hunter the Intel analyst

1084
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:06,730
says you will that for the first one you

1085
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,440
know is aware of something to look for

1086
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,180
and tells the its response or hey go

1087
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,610
look for this in the environment and

1088
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,339
they have a collaborative process that's

1089
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:17,590
going forward as they do the initial

1090
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,359
hunting they the Intel analyst is

1091
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:22,060
finding more external information or

1092
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,830
more sorts of things to look at the

1093
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,540
instant responder is you know she's

1094
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,759
going off in and you know imaging

1095
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:30,609
systems or you know gripping through

1096
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,880
logs or what have you right how you

1097
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:36,670
split up between those two is going to

1098
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,770
be a little bit org dependent right so

1099
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:41,170
if you have an organization that is

1100
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:43,750
large and mature enough to actually have

1101
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:46,180
an internal threat Intel team right that

1102
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,740
threat until team might actually coexist

1103
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,240
with an incident response team and

1104
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,669
they're going to have one way of doing

1105
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,100
it you might have an organization that

1106
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:56,650
has an external sock and that external

1107
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:59,290
sock has a third-party third thread and

1108
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:02,140
tell vendor that X as their kind of tier

1109
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:03,430
4 to your three analysts for them and

1110
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,900
they're going to have a different one

1111
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:08,080
right because the fact the organization

1112
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:10,570
here may only have one I our person and

1113
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:13,060
that I our person is also the firewall

1114
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,100
admin and ven admin and all those things

1115
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,710
right so typically speaking the way I

1116
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,750
would think of it myself is that the

1117
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,030
incident responder and somebody you may

1118
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,090
or may not agree the entrant responder

1119
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,310
is the person that is most responsible

1120
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:28,310
for dealing with the infrastructure in

1121
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,620
an organization

1122
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:32,330
right the actual assets the you know

1123
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,730
she's got the access to the system so

1124
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:36,980
the logs to the network devices what

1125
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,530
have you whereas the Intel analyst you

1126
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:42,470
know hopefully doesn't have direct

1127
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,930
access to those things and is instead

1128
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,959
working with you know external feeds or

1129
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:50,270
just other data sources and trying to

1130
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,040
you know correlate that to what else is

1131
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:55,220
known about this that how you would

1132
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,720
approach it yeah I mean I think what

1133
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,299
I've seen be most effective is teams

1134
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,470
that are co-locating threat Intel and I

1135
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:05,870
are in in the same place whether that be

1136
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:10,520
fusion fusion al who had fusion in

1137
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:12,470
buzzword bingo I I think i think that

1138
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,790
where you can Co locate those things so

1139
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,259
I mean if you've been in a sock

1140
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:18,290
environment it's not unusual for

1141
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,090
somebody to be on a console and go does

1142
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,730
anybody know anything about and should

1143
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:24,860
just say an IP address and it's so much

1144
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:26,570
more valuable if not only are other sock

1145
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,730
people with the same access looking at

1146
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:30,170
that but people with completely

1147
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,690
different access from an intelligence

1148
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,940
side are responding in the same way and

1149
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:38,300
so co-locating those two skills might be

1150
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:41,390
a single dfi our analyst who also has a

1151
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:44,450
strong intelligence mindset and it might

1152
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:46,970
also be a too specialized teams

1153
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:48,259
coexisting in the same area what what I

1154
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:52,279
think we're really just trying to get to

1155
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:54,830
you in this whole presentation is CTI by

1156
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,160
itself doesn't affect anything it

1157
00:47:54,830 --> 00:48:00,560
generates reports and I are without the

1158
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,359
intelligence to back it up can't respond

1159
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:06,080
to today's threats just waits for screen

1160
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,820
for bed screenshots fun yeah so so it's

1161
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,950
really more about co-locating those two

1162
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:13,910
things in whatever way makes most sense

1163
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:17,600
for your organization actually this is a

1164
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:23,270
selfish question so yarra on flow it's M

1165
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:25,279
olo ch yes Moloch is a like full packet

1166
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:28,220
capture indexing in it so let's say that

1167
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,110
you capture all the packets on your

1168
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,790
outside pipes right and you want to

1169
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:33,200
index that and be able to search that

1170
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,570
any time because you're doing full

1171
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,669
network monitoring you know that whole

1172
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,530
network security monitoring mindset

1173
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,520
Moloch is an open source tool to do that

1174
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,490
and a parent

1175
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,910
yarra can write tool orchid jharokon so

1176
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:49,220
yar is effectively a tool like snort but

1177
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:51,620
has historically been host focused you

1178
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:53,600
say okay look for files I have these

1179
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,980
binary strings there and match these

1180
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,259
different conditions and you have some

1181
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,840
indoors and those sorts of thing are you

1182
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,950
can do some boolean logic within it

1183
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:05,300
Moloch is a whole separate tool it's

1184
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:06,290
actually believe it or not from AOL you

1185
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,230
know occasionally they do one thing

1186
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:11,029
right no sorry I have my best friend for

1187
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,530
the rest of my life with all those cds

1188
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,270
and my best friend got laid off mayor

1189
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:17,780
well last week so i'm still hurting for

1190
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:19,100
him so anyway um the the idea being that

1191
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,670
you know these are you know just two

1192
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:25,279
different tools yarra itself is a kind

1193
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,620
of an open-source way to write AV

1194
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,210
signatures if you will one of the ways

1195
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,700
that it's useful by the way is if you

1196
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:34,220
have the subscription to virustotal the

1197
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,169
for pay the virus total intelligence or

1198
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,879
whatever you you can actually feed them

1199
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:40,670
yarra signatures and they'll alert you

1200
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,590
on any new sample that matches that Yara

1201
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,450
cig and then you can go download the

1202
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:46,640
sample and and and whatever and say okay

1203
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:51,890
I have a yaris egg for example let's say

1204
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:54,350
that has a mic um you know any email

1205
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,819
that has my company's domain in it right

1206
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,620
okay you're going to end up having to

1207
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,520
refine that I guarantee especially if

1208
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,430
you work for a company that does

1209
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,960
internet standards but the idea being

1210
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,129
that then you can have a yaris igg2 then

1211
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,020
go look for those things and now let me

1212
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:08,390
go see you know what's happening that is

1213
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:10,730
related to that any other question let's

1214
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:13,930
see one more question if we've got one

1215
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:21,400
it's a great opportunity don't lose out

1216
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:21,399
going once going twice Yolo good job

1217
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,250
alright thanks thank you guys a lot

1218
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:34,210
we're going to break out for the

1219
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:35,740
solution soap solutions showcase and

1220
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,410
that'll be the next hour then we have

1221
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,330
another network break and then we'll

1222
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:43,450
come back for a one-two punch with

1223
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:44,650
Lockheed guys and gal guy and gal for

1224
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:48,509
some really good stuff that are thinking

1225
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:48,510
we'll get a lot of benefit
