1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,390
found Kyle may try to one-up that

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,639
tomorrow let's see um so yeah just

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,349
reminded to do that also let's see I

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,969
think it was one of know maybe that's

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,679
the only reminders that I had so we'll

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,000
go ahead and get started on this oh the

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,650
other piece was questions we don't have

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,090
yellow cards so I'm going to do a little

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,948
bit of conversation with these guys ask

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,210
questions and then we'll open it up to

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,279
the audience and then we'll have a mic

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,359
on the floor for questions for you guys

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,519
so i'll let you you'll do the best

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,080
introductions for yourself so we'll

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,050
start on adam and just work the way down

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,000
if you guys could brief introduction

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,199
about you as a person but then talk a

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,760
little bit but more about your company

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,860
you're offering because i'm sure a lot

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,540
of attendees aren't familiar with you

21
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,850
guys so let's just do that and then I've

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,890
got some questions to kind of dig in to

23
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,750
take it away in Adam Vincent I'm the CEO

24
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,730
of a company called pret connect our

25
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,280
product is called fret connect my

26
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,739
background is I'm a computer scientist

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,739
and I hate when I hear about people

28
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,930
wasting their time and so I lucked into

29
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,140
meeting some analysts about four years

30
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,470
ago that told me about how they do their

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,229
jobs and it was frightening and so I set

32
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,330
out to build a platform that can make

33
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,400
their jobs easier and that became threat

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,960
connect were using the vernacular that

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,009
people have been using this morning were

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,820
a threat intelligence platform bed young

37
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,540
man I'm CTO of emerging threats and

38
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,100
emerging threats is an open source

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,229
project back from the old days our

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,570
primary thing was odd yes rules were

41
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,880
snort and now suricata and I'm also

42
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,289
involved in suruc out of the open and

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,869
information security foundation which

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,869
built that on grants and industry

45
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,150
involvement the products we have that

46
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,759
relevant today we have an ids rule set

47
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,460
for serious snort but we have IP and

48
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,890
domain rep feeds and a lot of different

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,229
categories and a lot of different things

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,600
there and we have a query portal that

51
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,619
gives context that's similar to the I

52
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,270
had the slammer I talked about the

53
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:02,759
opendns portal similar similar thing

54
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,740
so Adam are the the other Adam the chief

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,380
security strategist for surf watch labs

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,899
surf watch labs is a cyber risk

57
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,819
intelligence company so we complement a

58
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,250
lot of the other threat providers and

59
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,760
we're really looking at supporting to

60
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,220
see sweet so we take a 47 million events

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,530
a day and we crunch it down to something

62
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:25,950
digestible as for for a lot of strategic

63
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,450
reasons so we're definitely looking at

64
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,458
where that risk kind of media outside

65
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,988
view as you complement your internal

66
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,600
view with your intro stock type sensors

67
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,209
and and other feeds before that I was a

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,310
CISO for a large critical infrastructure

69
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,380
said they looked at quite a bit around

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,970
the industrial environment emergency

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,620
management law enforcement side a house

72
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,000
and prior to that I was director of

73
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,310
information assurance for a naval air

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,019
systems command so a lot of DoD type of

75
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,360
things is always interesting sit in a

76
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,590
room with disa and NSA cybercom all at

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,140
the same time you might have those kind

78
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,840
of meetings it's really really fun so

79
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,450
that's me in a nutshell oh and my name

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,610
is Mark Kendrick I'm from domaintools we

81
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,040
are a provider of cyber security

82
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,130
intelligence information as well as

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,019
tools to investigate things around

84
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,620
domain names IP addresses and the things

85
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,180
that connect them together I have had

86
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,880
the privilege of basically growing up

87
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,410
with the internet my first connection

88
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,630
the internet was about a 1200 baud modem

89
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,880
so I feel like that sometimes every time

90
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,019
I'm on Boingo trying to refresh the

91
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,380
Super Bowl score but that's another

92
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,700
problem and and so I've had the

93
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,180
privilege of really watching the net

94
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,010
evolve first as as being sort of kind of

95
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,989
an Aggie key sort of a thing to then

96
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,510
becoming a platform on which very

97
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,220
serious business was conducted and now

98
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,980
most recently on which very serious

99
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,160
threats are launched and it has provided

100
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,230
a very interesting perspective I have

101
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,290
been with two main tools now for over

102
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,388
seven years we my perspective when I

103
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,828
first started with the company was

104
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,930
really on the focus of the company had

105
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,030
at the time just on traffic and on

106
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,880
people buying and selling domain names

107
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,500
but even then there were a few people

108
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,690
lurking in the shadows of our accounts

109
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,690
that were doing very real investigations

110
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,949
and over the last few years we've made a

111
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,390
concerted effort of reaching out to

112
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,220
those p

113
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,070
able to learn more about what it is that

114
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,380
they're doing I I go in ostensibly to do

115
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,810
training and end up leading leaving from

116
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,370
they're smarter than I came in I think

117
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,200
receiving more than I'm giving and now

118
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,380
then most recently focusing very

119
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,719
squarely on the challenges of enterprise

120
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,120
security and helping people respond

121
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,130
appropriately to the kinds of threats

122
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,810
that they're seeing around domains IPS

123
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,480
and again the ways in which they're

124
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,590
connected okay thanks for thanks for the

125
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,020
quick intro you don't have to answer

126
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,969
this question in the audience I'm

127
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,130
curious it's curious how many people

128
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,360
might be using any of these guys out

129
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,430
here just to see what the odds like so

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,580
I'll just threat connect customers in

131
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:58,550
the audience so a few hands emerging

132
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:02,890
threats a few hands domaintools it looks

133
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:08,060
like domaintools got the lead surf watch

134
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:09,110
okay so you know one of the things one

135
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,610
of the things as an analyst and I'm

136
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,870
always talking to in fact we're talked

137
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,160
about at lunch I kind of get overwhelmed

138
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,450
by vendors and trying to understand what

139
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,430
they do so one of the questions I always

140
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,650
like to ask when I'm talking to a new

141
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,229
company either you know new to me or

142
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,789
there an actual startup is use cases so

143
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,190
we talked a little bit about in the

144
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,590
introduction I don't know maybe Matt

145
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,229
start off what are some of maybe the top

146
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,039
two use cases that an analyst here in

147
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:35,810
the room would you use you guys for our

148
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,510
tools in particular our incident

149
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,100
response oriented I mean you can use

150
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,840
some of our rep data for blocking up

151
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,669
front but everybody knows there's risk

152
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,700
there and nobody's false-positive free

153
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,260
so where I think we're most valuable for

154
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,420
some correlation and then

155
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,030
response you can go down through and

156
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,830
query for five years history on an idea

157
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,719
domain what other domains its had

158
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,030
related to it what other IP use that

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,920
domain is pointed to malware samples

160
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,599
that have been involved in it and then

161
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,580
in our case intrusion detection hits as

162
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,740
well so you can get down to all right I

163
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,900
had a hit on my firewall logs or IDs

164
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,210
logs I can go somewhere else and say

165
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,780
other people have seen that too mine is

166
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,419
likely a true positive or that say an IP

167
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,549
it's been clean for five years and my

168
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,040
hip to it either is an anomaly or a

169
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:26,900
false positive okay so it's a quick

170
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:30,710
response to this Adam so I think Ryan

171
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,909
Twp the threat intelligence platform use

172
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:36,590
case very well earlier today the only

173
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,800
thing I would I would stress that he

174
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,840
said is it has to be vendor neutral

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,220
there are no threat intelligence is

176
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,409
something that everyone's talking about

177
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,860
its being added to every product you buy

178
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,540
these days but being able to see your

179
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,580
needs through the noise is going to be

180
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,130
very difficult so the ability to see an

181
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,930
aggregate process of bringing data and

182
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,700
from a variety of sources not

183
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,700
overwhelming or analysts getting it into

184
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,750
an analytic process and then ultimately

185
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,969
disseminating across the organization

186
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,410
the only thing that I would add to what

187
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,760
Ryan talked about earlier and I talked

188
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,370
to him afterward he said he pulled this

189
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,260
slide because he didn't want to have too

190
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,050
long or presentation is the feedback

191
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,730
loop so once you start brokering

192
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,100
information and disseminating threat

193
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,350
Intel across your network you need to be

194
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,060
able to see what's happening and so a

195
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,190
threat intelligence platform needs to

196
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,710
seek that feedback so that you can make

197
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,860
better decisions about what intel has

198
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,438
what value to your organization next

199
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,699
alright thanks so with surf watch show

200
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,199
what we do is we don't really

201
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,879
concentrate so much on the machine the

202
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,830
machine type of feeds that other vendors

203
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,300
would would be providing we're really

204
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,508
looking at the machine the human is the

205
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,280
way i categorize it all the events we we

206
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,530
correlate together and we categorize

207
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,138
everything by actor target effect or

208
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,030
practice those four core categories so

209
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,189
who's doing it who was the target what

210
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,960
affected that have and what practice

211
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,909
that you use to achieve their goal okay

212
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,669
so what we're doing is we're trying to

213
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:03,110
give the sock as well as the c-suite

214
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,330
type decision makers from a risk

215
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,889
perspective if you've what's going on

216
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,960
out in the world what's going on in

217
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,400
their industry in specifics who's

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,590
getting hit how is it happening what's

219
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,568
out there that they need to pretty much

220
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,250
review your internal countermeasures

221
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:18,680
right and that should generate questions

222
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,659
and concerns internally to go to your

223
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,430
sock and say hey these these banks a

224
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:24,830
financial these banks have been going to

225
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,080
hit by this specific attack type by this

226
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,699
specific actor and I'm seeing that trend

227
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,919
up so they're making the rounds in our

228
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,899
industry are we well positioned for that

229
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,669
right what countermeasures do we have in

230
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,620
our house and what's our data telling us

231
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,029
so that we can give ourselves a leg up

232
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,219
right that's really what it boils down

233
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,809
to what we're trying to solve so you

234
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,579
know built several cyber security

235
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,319
programs from the ground up socks or a

236
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:47,060
part of that there's a lot of other

237
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,250
things and sock operations I had to

238
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,469
worry about but I really benefit from

239
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,120
that type of situational awareness not

240
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,730
everything's bits and bytes it's really

241
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,620
hey I need to know what my my peers are

242
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,839
getting hit with I need to know what my

243
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,510
competitors are being hit with I need to

244
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,220
know do I go to the c-suite business

245
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,529
units as they are we well position from

246
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,449
from a cyber security standpoint and as

247
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,829
socks are reeling this information as

248
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,019
well to do their own due diligence

249
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:14,660
that's really really the core use case

250
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:18,019
ok so I'll dig a little bit deeper i

251
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,089
have an analogy about the c-suite insist

252
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:21,610
those in particular and some folks have

253
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,510
heard me use it in the past you've got

254
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,040
thanksgiving meal or Christmas meal

255
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,319
insert holiday and you've got the adults

256
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,569
table and that's the c-suite the real

257
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,610
c-suite and a lot of times a security

258
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,070
leader is that the kids table rub and

259
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,370
mashed potatoes all over his face and

260
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,420
not not with the big kid conversation is

261
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,540
a certain level of maturity that's

262
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,189
required so my question

263
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,569
for you is how much sure doesn't work or

264
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,040
would you argue that you don't have to

265
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,630
have a certain level of maturity to be

266
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,310
able to move to that level of

267
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,660
conversation as I was saying in my

268
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,880
presentation right we start off very

269
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,310
indicator focus we're down at the lower

270
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,170
end of the pyramid you guys are a higher

271
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,750
level where we're at the higher level so

272
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,399
so we again we take the use the term

273
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,839
techno dork all right so it takes a

274
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,029
technical work out of the language and

275
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,040
we're categorizing right I a lot of

276
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,319
regardless of your technical background

277
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,389
you understand actor target effect and

278
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,189
practice and we're telling you how much

279
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:13,769
is it you know hitting and how much is

280
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,230
putting harm on your industry that will

281
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,000
help you translate to the higher level

282
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,740
conversations we also have some

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,089
capabilities where we put some program

284
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,699
management type of things in there when

285
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,190
we will map what data is happening out

286
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,250
there to your budget line item right so

287
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,199
so you can actually use the tool to

288
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,000
create your spend plan you can see if

289
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:35,099
you're over allocated in one threat area

290
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,319
and under allocated another threat area

291
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,519
in my experience right building having

292
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,579
to do a lot of relationship building

293
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,130
with other business unit leaders you

294
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:45,479
really have to articulate how your kind

295
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,949
of helping them and end it a day they

296
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,019
always view the security as a cost

297
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:51,300
center it's not a capability as a cost

298
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,589
to them you are a budget line item that

299
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,329
was eaten up too much of their budget

300
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,040
and they're not seeing a lot of the

301
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:58,680
return they didn't understand a language

302
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,990
so I think a lot of times it will help

303
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,329
you elevate up to the kitty if I away

304
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,449
from the kiddie table and translate that

305
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:08,579
it really really will if you get out of

306
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,959
the low level data socks should be

307
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,089
looking at the low level data and

308
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,709
passing it up so if you look at your of

309
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,630
course I know you guys are a start-up

310
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,699
but your existing customer base are if

311
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,490
we went back to my 1% or ten percent or

312
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:22,279
ninety percent are your your key

313
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,389
customers those that are more mature

314
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,319
have a certain level of maturity in

315
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,600
their overall threat intelligence

316
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:29,819
program you know where do you fit in

317
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,990
from that maturation spot a lot of our

318
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,240
current customers are really in the

319
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,759
build phase i think the consumer goods

320
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,680
healthcare financial type of sectors

321
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,939
they've been in the news quite a bit

322
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,459
right and they don't want to be in the

323
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:44,430
news themselves and so we're helping

324
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,529
them define internally are they well

325
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,709
positioned right are they is there

326
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:51,629
spend really really boiling into some

327
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,930
type of capability that they can really

328
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,399
you know drive home internally so a lot

329
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,589
of that sin bill of faiths it's not

330
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,720
super mature socks it might be a loose

331
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:01,980
sock right it's just a couple couple

332
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,829
people in a room that kind of watching

333
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,290
all the other their sim their IDs or

334
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:09,479
endpoint whatever they got going trying

335
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:12,029
to keep up with the log deluge and

336
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,279
really just chasing alarms worked we're

337
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,199
trying to give them that external view

338
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,730
instead of shotgunning everything your

339
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:20,519
laser beam me up right so I know

340
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,589
specifically what resources from a

341
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,279
people processor technology standpoint

342
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:28,290
do I need to apply to certain area ok

343
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,120
we're going to dig back at that question

344
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,829
a little bit in a little bit but I want

345
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,779
to make sure we don't forget my question

346
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:37,109
before I kind of started going down um

347
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:38,309
so mark top two use cases for you and I

348
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,170
know you did a lunch and learn so I

349
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,969
think that one was packed so but for

350
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,259
those it didn't go to the one of the top

351
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,759
two use cases you could help these guys

352
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,439
out with sure definitely and I'll

353
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,629
preface this by saying that I'm always

354
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:50,519
uncovering new use cases it's actually

355
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:51,720
fascinating to me sometimes when I go

356
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,800
into somebody and they're like well this

357
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,990
is what we're trying to use the main

358
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,120
tools for and I'm like really i had no

359
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,420
idea would even do that and and I've

360
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,160
been doing it of course for some time so

361
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,509
I'll distill down those two use cases I

362
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,610
think kind of alluded what you said

363
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,350
before there based on whether they're in

364
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,949
kind of the one percent or the other

365
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,029
percentage there so folks that are often

366
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:13,649
times when they're very first

367
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,480
encountering a threat it's around a

368
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,370
domain and IP address they simply need

369
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,019
to get some context for it that's all

370
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,860
they're doing is they just need context

371
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,420
and so they're going to go and they're

372
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,519
going to do a whois lookup right now if

373
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,259
you're trying to automate your entire

374
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,519
process and you're like oh goodness it's

375
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,170
got to be more sophisticated than that

376
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,209
at some level that's what's really

377
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,589
happening so they need an authoritative

378
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,119
source to do that they need someplace

379
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,490
that they can trust as to where their

380
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,800
queries are going and they choose two

381
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,240
main tools for that they also choose us

382
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,459
because of the context we put around

383
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,290
there we help them easily see what other

384
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,569
things that domain is connected with if

385
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,339
it's privacy protected we've got nine

386
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:49,319
billion who is records and chances are

387
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,779
somewhere in that history is the

388
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:53,279
attribution they might be needing or we

389
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,899
can simply glue those records together

390
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,640
and help them make correlations among

391
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,020
those to make

392
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,480
we can help them get to those places

393
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,760
very quickly help them ascribe the right

394
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,070
level of risk to that domain or IP it is

395
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,500
that they're looking at I would say the

396
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,990
other really interesting use case comes

397
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,010
for and I guess right now I am seeing

398
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,300
this predominantly around the one

399
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,560
percent but also starting to trickle

400
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,810
down even to the ten percent level

401
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,030
people that are wanting to do that same

402
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,709
sort of a thing at scale they're saying

403
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,810
that yeah these sort of having an

404
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,220
analyst take a look at domains that are

405
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,810
showing up on a blacklist and maybe

406
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,820
adding those to a firewall that's sort

407
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,349
of interesting having them look at some

408
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,700
really bad ones and maybe look at some

409
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,740
others that are connected that's kind of

410
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,750
cool we just do that for like all the

411
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,760
domains so they're saying what if we

412
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,770
were to take every domain that's coming

413
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,000
on a black let's expand that out to all

414
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,829
the other domains that are related by

415
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,780
say the same registrant information and

416
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,100
then just block all of them and oh by

417
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,930
the way let's also look for any new

418
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,030
registrations around those and let's

419
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,099
block those proactively as well so it

420
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,500
gets toward that automation goal that I

421
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,480
think a lot of people have and they are

422
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,090
looking to our data and our systems to

423
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,640
be able to provide that for them at

424
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,900
scale to court of take the analytical

425
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,720
pathways that have proven to be very

426
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,250
effective for them as a single analyst

427
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,230
on the keyboard and now then moving that

428
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,560
into something that they do largely at

429
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,810
scale are you guys primarily be to see

430
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,939
or do you do partnerships with other

431
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,989
security vendors were security measures

432
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:21,050
in the space sure good question we r b2

433
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,870
very see in some cases certainly the

434
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,160
roots of domaintools started out with

435
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,080
people just doing a Google search for a

436
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,699
domain name and they would end up coming

437
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,890
to our site because Google felt that we

438
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,390
had a really good meta information about

439
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,569
that so from the perspective of just

440
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,189
everyday consumer certainly we have of

441
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,830
course especially in the last couple

442
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:42,320
years a growing number of customers that

443
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,990
are I guess the more professional

444
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,330
consumers more Enterprise consumers and

445
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,390
then yes we are also integrated with a

446
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,070
number of various partners of which

447
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,750
there is one that direct connect that

448
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,210
allows us to speak about that one

449
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,580
publicly which we're very grateful thank

450
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,700
you so yes there's a growing number of

451
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,110
integrations we're partners have said

452
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,240
you know their customers I guess are

453
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,160
really asking for more context around

454
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,939
certain aspects of information within

455
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,649
their make

456
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:12,769
within their portal even in some cases

457
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:15,679
within their sim and two as a way to try

458
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:17,899
and respond to that then we are they're

459
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,488
looking to us to provide that that

460
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,439
context that enrichment and that

461
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:26,179
expansion and in some cases an ongoing

462
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:28,608
monitoring as well ok all right so next

463
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:31,728
question is you guys feel like you have

464
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:41,839
a good idea for what they do ok ok go

465
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:45,889
ahead let's analytic platform to make

466
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:50,559
sense of threat intelligence yeah that's

467
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,559
correct yes

468
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,790
originator in context

469
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:11,970
yes yep we're really looking at the risk

470
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,919
of the analytics right so we do collect

471
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,050
quite a copious amount of data we run it

472
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,470
through analytics and we come out with a

473
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,940
result that's more strategic in view not

474
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,100
so much tactical from like an instant

475
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,730
response or indicate our compromise type

476
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:30,159
of type of context it's very strategic

477
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,200
it's looking at the actor target effects

478
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,760
of practices within your given industry

479
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,760
however you build your profile

480
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,220
I'd say the closer to the repository

481
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,450
that you mentioned before is

482
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,759
predominantly what's powering a lot of

483
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,100
our products and then increasingly

484
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,470
becoming a platform on which to launch

485
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,750
intelligence investigations around the

486
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,279
main I'm just gonna make a quick joke

487
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,570
every vendor has a platform you know

488
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,220
absolutely i was talking about getting

489
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,750
beat down by similar things here all the

490
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:06,279
time everybody's got a platform so you

491
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,690
got to have a platform i guess but i'm

492
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:11,200
sorry i'm just taking a quick stab it

493
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,909
you know vendor goes back to my fusion

494
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,669
ended up drinking games now the problem

495
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:17,350
is we can't we can't say anything back

496
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:19,090
because he has the next question on his

497
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,860
cheat sheet no no you can fire back at

498
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,899
me too that's right you could say hey

499
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,539
other analysts firm guys that's way

500
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:28,239
better questions than you do you say

501
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:30,100
however however you want sorry i don't

502
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:35,830
know if it did you get all your can't do

503
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:39,610
that summary help you mean domaintools

504
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:41,500
in us know will you actually use domain

505
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,508
tools to enrich all the data that our

506
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,299
customers put in the platform so this is

507
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:47,740
confusing stuff and I I think Rick I

508
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,179
like this earlier its threat

509
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,950
intelligence means a lot of different

510
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,690
things to a lot of different people all

511
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,230
the products are going to say that it's

512
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,929
what they do the reality is i mean i can

513
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,960
try to simplify it down to it's just

514
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,309
it's making better decisions about what

515
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,169
you should do in your organization

516
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,529
whether that be tactical or strategic

517
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:11,110
and there's going to be data from

518
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:13,240
various sources that you can use in that

519
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,459
there's going to be various technologies

520
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,500
like domaintools that gets more

521
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,750
information about something so to

522
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:25,240
rebuttal your platform mistake i think

523
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,289
that the term platform is very

524
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,759
indicative of integrating the best of

525
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:33,789
the technologies that you as

526
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:36,039
practitioners need to make decisions so

527
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:39,908
whether that be Farsight pulling in data

528
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:41,559
or domain tools or someone else you have

529
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,120
to figure out what kind of decisions you

530
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,710
want to make and then the platform is

531
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,908
responsible for gluing it all together

532
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,489
and allowing your people to be more

533
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:52,340
productive in that process so it's not

534
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:55,059
it's not easy and it changes based on

535
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,059
who you talk to

536
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:05,269
but we have synergy and fusion in the

537
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:12,709
cloud with all the right that's right

538
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:14,389
haha very nice that's actually something

539
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,340
else that I use an analyst to try to

540
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:18,469
understand someone maybe could you run

541
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,639
through your top okay this is something

542
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,989
else that bugs me as an analyst I'll ask

543
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,100
someone who their competitors are and a

544
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,440
vendor will say we don't have any

545
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,779
competitors which which everybody has

546
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,249
has direct competitors but also everyone

547
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:29,869
is competing for budget so if it's

548
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:31,729
helpful for the room to maybe mention

549
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:33,228
your top two competitors in your fate

550
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:35,389
although I know some of you do multiple

551
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:37,340
things but top tube energy coming up

552
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:39,129
fuel so on the less mature side it's

553
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,019
definitely threat stream with feed

554
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:44,209
aggregation on the analytic side it's

555
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:47,720
home built its many of you guys in the

556
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:51,049
fortune 500 that have built a you know

557
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,629
elk backed data analytic platform Alex

558
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:56,389
you know has a lot of good war stories

559
00:20:53,629 --> 00:21:00,320
in that area so on one side it's build

560
00:20:56,389 --> 00:21:02,928
another side it's you know the feed play

561
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:07,460
which is to be shot I think I think you

562
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:12,049
took a shot so on the Intel side

563
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,789
probably Norse iid books like that

564
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,668
although half of us are partners as well

565
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:18,200
in that space on the rule side

566
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:20,239
Sourcefire which is now Cisco and

567
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,610
thankfully pulling them out of the

568
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:25,280
limelight force which is

569
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,229
it's tough one because we don't we don't

570
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,560
really deal with the low level you know

571
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,240
stuff with the signature level type of

572
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,010
stuff so maybe a little bit of eyesight

573
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,890
partner so a little bit of threat stream

574
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:39,050
i think you know we there's no carbon

575
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,390
copy i would say competitor that was

576
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,190
talking to jason one of your founders

577
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,650
last week asked the same question i said

578
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,480
what about bit site mmm yeah yeah a

579
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,230
little bit yeah I think so it's it's one

580
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,690
of the things where I don't think

581
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,000
there's a one hundred percent true a

582
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,580
carbon copy competitor there's a lot of

583
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,410
different vendors that that do a lot of

584
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,169
things I've seen a similar look and feel

585
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,200
and pockets it's but it's not all

586
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:07,550
brought together on the domain tool side

587
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,540
sure so um hey uh I no trolling for me

588
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,790
cuz now you guys are going to start

589
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,170
throwing out more stuff like guys did I

590
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:16,280
don't have any competitor that's right

591
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,960
that's right um so I guess predominantly

592
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,430
so certainly there's this sort of naive

593
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,110
sense that I can just go and get who is

594
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,370
data because it's just out there which

595
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,229
is not a big deal I can just go ahead

596
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,810
and make a whois query and I'm there and

597
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,340
it's great go try to do about a hundred

598
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,770
and one of those and then come back and

599
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,389
let's have that conversation so there's

600
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,260
some difficulty around that but

601
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,200
certainly you know if you're just

602
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:41,480
starting small scale that works there

603
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:44,450
are larger databases of Whois data who

604
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,920
is XML API is one of them certainly our

605
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:51,080
data extends way beyond just who is data

606
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,820
and we've also had customers that and

607
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,649
this is absolutely a true story we've

608
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,500
had customers who have tried our

609
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,090
competitive products and come back to us

610
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,830
and said yeah that didn't work out so

611
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,780
well so we need to restart this

612
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,080
conversation which made the pricing

613
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,670
discussion a whole lot of fun by the way

614
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,889
so I think there's that part of it to my

615
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,480
knowledge right now nobody has

616
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,520
aggregated as much data as we have in

617
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,810
the same place nobody is collecting it

618
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,720
at the scale that we're collecting it

619
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,179
and nobody is archiving and presenting

620
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,830
it at the scale of which we are okay so

621
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,840
follow it follow question which you may

622
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,480
not want to answer some time

623
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,090
cagey about it talking about an average

624
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,530
customer size and what that cost is like

625
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,300
a list price for an average you know I

626
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,460
want an average deal size for a customer

627
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,080
because we have we have a number of

628
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,820
different capabilities here you just

629
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,199
just throw it out this price like you

630
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,909
would on a on a website or something

631
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,040
like that these are these are prospects

632
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,770
and they just want to know if your 800

633
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,530
grand 20 grand 100 grand no no I know

634
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:52,960
why people dropped out of this panel yes

635
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:55,300
no kidding all right I'll go first since

636
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,120
I like to be put on the spot all right

637
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,889
so going back to my initial comment of

638
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,620
you know I think that there's a lot of

639
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,990
sophisticated threat intelligence know

640
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,179
how in this room but I like to think

641
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,940
threat intelligence is for everyone not

642
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:13,810
just for the people that work in the IC

643
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,940
and so on the one end of the spectrum I

644
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:18,820
think many of you have threaded Trek

645
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,250
connect accounts it's free there's data

646
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,250
in there that didn't come from my

647
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,560
company but it came from your peers many

648
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,960
of you and fortune 500 companies or are

649
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,030
partaking and communities within threat

650
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,600
connect today sharing data with each

651
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:38,200
other also free all of what threat

652
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,810
connect does is for the good of cyber

653
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,630
defense we we do whatever we can to

654
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:45,669
provide that at a low cost or at a free

655
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,490
level because we want to give back

656
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:50,680
however you know people always ask how

657
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:54,220
we make money and the way we make money

658
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:58,060
as we sell the fortune 500 our prices

659
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:01,150
range from 45 k on the public cloud to

660
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,980
half a million plus on the on-prem so

661
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,630
you have an on-premise solution we do

662
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,510
just want to clarify that i get a lot

663
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,840
just for me competitors placing you only

664
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,940
in the clouds yeah

665
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,379
okay that's good i'm just looking for

666
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,130
orders of magnitude to help you guys

667
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,370
because I have a follow-up question

668
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,870
after this after we work through this

669
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:21,020
but that one you know I already told you

670
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,250
what that one is so there's been for

671
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,460
that you didn't know about him one that

672
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:29,360
you did so all right nope working down

673
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:31,850
just rough were magnitude on cost for me

674
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,549
for rule sets idea aside 500 bucks a

675
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,860
sensor a year that discounted of course

676
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:38,418
on intelligence two or three thousand a

677
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,610
year to tens of thousands a year

678
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:43,120
depending on use we have our open side

679
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:47,719
open community will send as well so

680
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,850
we're open source hippies hard so re

681
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,200
likes of structure so it's not really on

682
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,850
premise off cloud-based so it's used our

683
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,409
count bass that all depends on how many

684
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,750
users you you want to have and it

685
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:58,250
steered obviously not the more you buy

686
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,690
that the bazaar goes that number of

687
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,190
seats that access the portal or is that

688
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,320
number of employees in a company user

689
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,090
accounts rights login potential alright

690
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,590
so it's it's our main counts you have

691
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,059
this which is going to be dictated by

692
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,070
your user base and you're you know

693
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:13,158
obviously your organizational size and

694
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,600
how distributed they are so it steered

695
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,029
that way and obviously the more accounts

696
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,709
you have the more value pricing there

697
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,779
would be that you would expect from from

698
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,480
a higher level it usually starts about

699
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:27,770
ten grand and rolls up paying on

700
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:30,890
quantity so most of our customers so our

701
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,600
customers really do range in size if

702
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,210
they're just using the web portal and

703
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,709
they're just interacting with their most

704
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,210
of them depending on what their needs

705
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:43,880
are maybe 10 15 k maybe less kind of

706
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:47,179
really depends on what their what their

707
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,380
level of sophistication is and how much

708
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:53,029
they beg so there's that then on the

709
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,549
upper end we have people that are

710
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,620
consuming our data scale and that's

711
00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:00,950
starting to get you know somewhere into

712
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,110
six figures and if that's scary to you

713
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,539
there's that's actually kind of an

714
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,459
interesting discussion we've had some

715
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:10,129
customers that are initially horrified

716
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,950
at that level like oh my gosh mr. who is

717
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,110
database what

718
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,669
her and then they come back to me six

719
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,830
nine months later and they're like okay

720
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:19,620
we understand the problems we're trying

721
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,830
to solve now and we're ready we're ready

722
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,059
to go with that level and but you know

723
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,320
what if you just want the API and you

724
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,789
want to start out with it just let me

725
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,320
know and I'll find a way to kind of get

726
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:31,230
you into it for a whole lot less than

727
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,668
that so so my follow-up I'm just trying

728
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,110
to help you guys understand a lot of

729
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:35,610
different go to mark and stuff like that

730
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,529
my follow-up question cuz I know this is

731
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:40,049
the case for some folks here we're just

732
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:42,630
now standing up SETI program we're

733
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:46,559
bringing in staff I have very limited

734
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:51,090
budget for 2015 which one of you do I've

735
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:54,510
nest in first and this one they knew

736
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,129
about any man so it well an email was

737
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,269
sent so if you should email to me it

738
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,139
doesn't mean I rented that may not be

739
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:02,460
the case for them what email so we'll

740
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,600
just work our way down now is work now

741
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,350
you have yeah we're Carrick from this

742
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,219
adam klein and work day so let me think

743
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,789
of how to say this without sounding

744
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,139
selfish when you start any part of your

745
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:14,399
business what are the first things you

746
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:17,519
do you understand your requirements

747
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,379
right and i think this is no different a

748
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,940
threat intelligence program starts with

749
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,159
understanding the needs of the customers

750
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,159
that you're going to service within your

751
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,169
organization first and foremost what

752
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,590
their requirements are to get their job

753
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:34,169
done then you need to look at how to

754
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:37,199
technically support that and then build

755
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:39,120
the processes around that so I know you

756
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,830
hate the word but platform is important

757
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,678
here what you're saying is you mean

758
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,840
that's why you started so what when you

759
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,490
think about it you know any other part

760
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,620
of your business when you're going to

761
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,450
make an investment in people you make an

762
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,830
investment in technology first because

763
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,200
you want to make those people more

764
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,809
productive and the last thing you can

765
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,000
technology before people technology

766
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:01,830
before people yes you need process

767
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,720
before technology but then you need

768
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,629
people after you have the right

769
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,490
foundation laid so you don't hire a

770
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:12,419
pilot to fly an airplane until you own

771
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:14,399
an airplane so you need to look at at

772
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,690
the trajectory that you're going to need

773
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,250
to support the people you're going to

774
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,200
hire because hiring them in handing them

775
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,320
a spreadsheet is going to waste a lot of

776
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,299
their time and so I would say that

777
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,580
Connect comes first because it's the

778
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:28,110
platform that you're going to use to

779
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,699
make those people productive on their

780
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,740
first day of employment while they're

781
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,139
waiting for their sensitivity training

782
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,200
and other things that they have to do to

783
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:39,840
get started in there in your workplace I

784
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,159
want my people first people before

785
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,259
technology was in my hierarchy of needs

786
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:46,230
to but it depends on what people are

787
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,940
talking about but I do agree there's a

788
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,259
certain skill set and there's certain

789
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,940
things there and probably most

790
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:52,679
organizations aren't some of them they

791
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,720
already have some existing staff may be

792
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,970
complimented they may be repurposing ir

793
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,259
guys so in all cases it's not always a

794
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,730
complete net new scenario so okay I

795
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:05,730
would say if you don't have IDs

796
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,500
infrastructure first go there whether

797
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:11,549
it's our rules or someone else and then

798
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,379
pass that we're in a good complement for

799
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:15,750
folks using our rule sets on sir cutters

800
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:17,519
North because are the context you're

801
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,289
going to get around the reputation data

802
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,360
is related to those signatures as well

803
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:23,519
and the signatures also tell you IDs and

804
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,070
domains related to those so that's a

805
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,169
good fix for us or a fit of our data

806
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,120
together if that's all you're going to

807
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:33,419
use if you're going to use multiple feed

808
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:37,289
platforms or multiple data feeds then

809
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:38,429
you definitely need a tip as I guess

810
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:41,340
that's term is coming up for y'all now

811
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:45,929
so they're definitely the basics first

812
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:47,389
IDs firewalls Sims log correlation then

813
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,190
pick the data feed that's going to be

814
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:53,309
best fit the tools that you have and

815
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,929
ours fits most but not all and if your

816
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,500
multiple feeds of course may be a step

817
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,020
up use a platform to aggregate

818
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:03,580
and push to your stuff okay what still

819
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:05,080
by hours so I'm gonna put my CI so kind

820
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,330
of hat on just kind of exactly this is

821
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,129
no BS how I how I think when I built my

822
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,530
programs is a look at things how much

823
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,610
capability do I give per dollar spent

824
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,230
right I got to be a good steward of the

825
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,520
budget I got to squeeze beer out of the

826
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,470
turn up writings you don't get a whole

827
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,600
lot and I really want to look at what my

828
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,040
capability gaps are and everybody's

829
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,959
going to be different right you're

830
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,909
always going to have to your point of

831
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,400
view if your behavioral signature based

832
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,600
environment in your core network isn't

833
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,040
squared away squared away if your

834
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,570
endpoints aren't squared away squared

835
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,909
away if your user authentication

836
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,800
identity management access control

837
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,270
squared away square that away and when

838
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,430
you square that away you've gotten to

839
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,379
that that top 20 controls kind of kind

840
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,150
of environment you know what normal

841
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,010
looks like so you're right now starting

842
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,540
to wonder well what does abnormal look

843
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,810
like then you're going to start

844
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,820
investing in these other tools I i I'm

845
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,560
going to lean towards my tool because

846
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,629
there's no back-end hidden costs either

847
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,120
right or a cloud-based you turn on the

848
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,340
account you got the data all right you

849
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,229
have the data you know I can't tell you

850
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,780
and I bet there's people who will relate

851
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,400
to this how many times i bought a tool

852
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,500
it was bundled in a Cadillac only

853
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,300
version next to you know I gotta hire

854
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,040
half work here a full work here of an

855
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,050
integration I got professional service

856
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,000
on sir hosting environment next thing

857
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,770
you know I got half mil in and i'm not

858
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,510
even at full operational capability i

859
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,010
mean made a decision off of anything yet

860
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,170
all right i'm just trying to get it

861
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,210
there they always ask me why suspended

862
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,160
other the blah so everything is that

863
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,230
sound familiar right so so been there

864
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,510
done that a hundred times that's why we

865
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,570
designed our cloud-based you turn it on

866
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,010
it's on it is an API so in the future

867
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,540
we're looking at you know work with like

868
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,090
the arc sites out there to say hey just

869
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,670
point the API you render it within your

870
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,560
own environment so that's the kind of

871
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,450
where I deal with we're also looking to

872
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,340
trying to define what's well-positioned

873
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,490
what's the rest of the world look like

874
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,620
right from a capability standpoint where

875
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,700
are you light where are you heavy and

876
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,949
then where you gotta spent you know

877
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,260
reprogram that budget and we provide

878
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,090
that for a low cost all right and we

879
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,430
behind that I mentioned as we also i

880
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:06,110
have like a small I sack team so you get

881
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:07,460
a risk reports you get alerts

882
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,740
joost in with a lot of different

883
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,000
organizations so every couple days you

884
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,200
get alerts from us say hey pay attention

885
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,500
to this because it's hurting other

886
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,210
people go to your sock and ask them hey

887
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,120
I see that we're seeing this out in the

888
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,220
world are we well positioned you know if

889
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,540
you see a surf watch kind of alert says

890
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,130
hey this domain's really doing a lot of

891
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,659
stuff obviously there's other providers

892
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,970
of that I would be turning my sock is

893
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,809
saying this stuff on the blacklist you

894
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,400
know because other people in our

895
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:33,230
industry really getting hit hard with

896
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,910
this ransomware it's hitting you know

897
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,380
this variant of crypto wall has been

898
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,910
hitting this interest industry and

899
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,890
that's our industry they're really

900
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,750
targeting these type of people how are

901
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,370
we positioned for this variant right I

902
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,380
think it's coming across tour now so

903
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,760
it's like hey we blocking for you know

904
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,230
do we need tour obviously we shouldn't

905
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,390
have to have tour in a banking industry

906
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,950
anything like that so is it blocked

907
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,840
which does mitigate the threat that way

908
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,590
and it should be pushing that

909
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,110
conversation to your sock absolutely so

910
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,809
I had somebody recently tell me and this

911
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,729
is a direct quote they had come from

912
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:06,500
another organization and they were

913
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,840
coming into a company that was spinning

914
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,690
up their friend tell capacity part of

915
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,280
that was hiring them in to kind of lead

916
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,500
that effort to kind of Shepherd the

917
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,879
things make the right decisions and and

918
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,790
that person told me really kind of

919
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,319
unsolicited they said that in their

920
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,300
opinion if you wanted to do threat

921
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,310
intelligence properly you needed to have

922
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,300
domain tools as part of what you were

923
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:31,190
doing and so and that is it's something

924
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,540
that I don't selectively choose that

925
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,580
quote that's something that we hear

926
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,850
often we had some people tell us one

927
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:39,139
time that all they really needed was

928
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,368
malware signatures passive DNS and

929
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,040
domain tools and they could rule the

930
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:45,379
world and based on the place that they

931
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,109
were working at the time I could totally

932
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:53,659
see that so I think the reality is that

933
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:57,020
at some point early on in your threat

934
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,270
intelligence maturity cycle you're going

935
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,070
to encounter domains and you're going to

936
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,660
some extent encounter IP addresses and

937
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,850
you're going to be perplexed you're

938
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,980
going to wonder what do I do now to try

939
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,270
and go from here and because they're

940
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,950
going to show up in so many different

941
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,009
places you really do need something to

942
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,290
try and give you the context on

943
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,460
now if you happen to look at it and

944
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,009
you're like you know what we're really

945
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,840
we're like we're in the 99 percent right

946
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,460
we're so just really getting going on

947
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,420
this and I'm getting this data out of

948
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,070
debating tools but I really have

949
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,570
absolutely no idea what to do with it if

950
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,760
that's where you're at right now in the

951
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:31,960
capability then look at something like a

952
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,520
platform such as threat connect that

953
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,870
you're going to get the benefit of the

954
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,630
main tools in there and you're also

955
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:40,120
going to get a context in which to put

956
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,580
that information and then later on as

957
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,839
some of our customers have you may

958
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,069
decide you know what I want to start

959
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,200
doing some of this more hands-on

960
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,130
investigation myself in which case thank

961
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,240
you very much i'm going to take

962
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,160
domaintools i'm going to keep my

963
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,299
platform going at the same time and i'm

964
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,920
going to work these two things in

965
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,330
parallel and then eventually end up

966
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,360
scaling up to something a little bit

967
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:01,210
larger okay all right I think we got

968
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,980
what 20 minutes left or so we'll see if

969
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,610
there's any questions from the audience

970
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,410
yeah we're good no not busy all right so

971
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:18,820
i took my shots that the audience is

972
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:20,830
turned another what we call threat

973
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,630
intelligence right now really is shared

974
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,730
situational awareness somebody has to be

975
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,950
hit first and then that information is

976
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,360
shared what do we need to do

977
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,470
collectively to get to the point where

978
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,000
we're actually in the predictive

979
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,680
business this is where they're going to

980
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,290
hit next this is what it's going to look

981
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,149
like and how we push that to our

982
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:41,170
perimeter so we can defend against the

983
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:44,950
hoodie attack actually hits anybody I'd

984
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,810
say we've been I mean that the

985
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:50,589
predictive I think depends on size of

986
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:53,650
data set and how much context around the

987
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:56,110
data set we are experiment with that for

988
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,340
the eighty percent we can predict we

989
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,770
know these bulletproof nuts these

990
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:03,040
bulletproof kolos we know they're going

991
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,330
to be bad for a long time so predicting

992
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,680
that eighty percent is fine the other

993
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,810
twenty percent of course is always the

994
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,180
problem the

995
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,700
anybody can pick up an IP that's been

996
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,740
clean forever a new domain registered

997
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,049
with a clean domain that's never been

998
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,339
used for anything else before and put it

999
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,050
on a name server that's brand new as

1000
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,620
well as as well never been used for

1001
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,820
anything else we can't predict what if

1002
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:28,380
that's good or bad until we see

1003
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,060
activities so predictive pretty much a

1004
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,480
home run for eighty percent for the

1005
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,880
really important stuff I don't know that

1006
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,980
we can it's got to be activity

1007
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,900
observation based I think I've feeds it

1008
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,880
to detection and response if you can

1009
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,350
eliminate eighty percent of the noise

1010
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,110
then that last twenty percent that we

1011
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,299
can't predict we can't prevent we can

1012
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,130
use our limited resources to do the deck

1013
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,610
detection response upon I think that's

1014
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:55,080
definitely some of it I think too for us

1015
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,550
what we've seen some of our largest and

1016
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,740
most sophisticated customers doing is

1017
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,270
saying that when they get in information

1018
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,919
about sales particular domain name is

1019
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,300
being bad shows up on a black list or

1020
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,340
maybe they observe itself doing

1021
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,750
something bad they're going to go into

1022
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,670
domaintools they're going to expand out

1023
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,440
to see what other domains are related by

1024
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,270
some of the attributes that you

1025
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,400
described before their shared name

1026
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,230
servers shared IP address shared

1027
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,730
ownership information and they're going

1028
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,320
to use that resultant list of domains

1029
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,630
they've now expanded their perspective

1030
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,760
in to respond proactively they may block

1031
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,050
those they may start looking for any new

1032
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,970
domains that are registered by the same

1033
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,440
people it's a very effective and

1034
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,390
interesting tactic especially if you

1035
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,160
kind of have large-scale access to the

1036
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,020
data one of the things that we've been

1037
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,089
working on is finding ways of taking

1038
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,780
that same sort of guilt by association

1039
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:42,960
concept and and pulling it into a way in

1040
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,910
which we can provide it as either an on

1041
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,070
demand or as a feed sort of model so

1042
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,690
we're kind of a reputation based concept

1043
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,570
to where we start saying you know what

1044
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:54,090
at some certain point when this email

1045
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:56,190
address is used on like five known

1046
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,670
domains that are bad let's just assume

1047
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:02,160
the other 14 are also bad and let's also

1048
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,990
do the same thing with at certain

1049
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,420
thresholds with IP addresses with name

1050
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,220
servers and name server IP addresses and

1051
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,710
we're going to allow that to trickle

1052
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,660
down and propagate to those

1053
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:14,839
and in so doing what we'll do is we'll

1054
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,490
provide too many people a kind of a

1055
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:18,140
package solution to the kinds of things

1056
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,399
a very large scale enterprises are

1057
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,618
already doing large scale ins and it

1058
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,080
responds companies as well are doing

1059
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:26,330
with domaintools as scale I think that

1060
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,670
correlation is definitely there's a lot

1061
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,740
of a lot of promise in that and our

1062
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,109
lease testing and early statistics on

1063
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:36,649
that have borne that out to be very true

1064
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:39,650
and very useful and relevant and I think

1065
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,869
that it's it remains a relevant and an

1066
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,130
interesting and powerful vector that we

1067
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:47,660
probably could be utilizing a lot more

1068
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,730
commonly to what we are today so we

1069
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,348
talked briefly about technology verse

1070
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,820
people and I think we all agree that

1071
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:55,070
people need to be somewhere in the

1072
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,140
process so with each of your services or

1073
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:59,510
products and what specific skill sets

1074
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:02,000
and ideally how many personnel should

1075
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,260
accompany have in order to make I guess

1076
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,990
take the best advantage of what you guys

1077
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:08,839
have to offer good question so all

1078
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,819
starts in sight I don't know if I said

1079
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,220
it correctly last time as people are

1080
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,380
critical they're the ones that create

1081
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,848
the process in the first place it's only

1082
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,290
after they create the process in the

1083
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:21,290
requirements do you actually know what

1084
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,400
the platform should do I'm a firm

1085
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,339
believer and that threat intelligence

1086
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,859
doesn't need to be very sophisticated it

1087
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:30,980
can be as simple as tying together an

1088
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:33,500
incident responder with domaintools with

1089
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,690
you know three feeds and helping that

1090
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,869
instant responder do the job of an

1091
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,810
analyst however I will say that most of

1092
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:44,660
our customers today our fortune 500 most

1093
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:47,990
of them have just hired two three ten

1094
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:51,770
people out of the IC and they are just

1095
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:54,799
building an Intel program I know my hope

1096
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,150
is that that's not the norm and that you

1097
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,790
know that you people are the more

1098
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:02,760
sophisticated threat Intel practitioners

1099
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:05,160
but threat Intel can be for the masses

1100
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,820
so for surf watch the same question also

1101
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:11,339
i think we've positioned our data and in

1102
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:14,280
a way that i think both the the the

1103
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:16,410
developers engineers the the analyst and

1104
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,240
a sock as well as somebody who's not

1105
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,399
from that technical round can both

1106
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,109
consume the same day off right because

1107
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,570
it's presented from a risk management

1108
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:26,610
type of standpoint but you're also able

1109
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,380
to drill down into some details if you

1110
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,640
need that right and then they can look

1111
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,140
at their other tools right because

1112
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,700
everybody has multiple tools on toolbox

1113
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,770
right you buy a tool to answer a

1114
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,620
specific question and so i think uh

1115
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,690
answer your question it's a good

1116
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,720
translator right it's a very good

1117
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,010
translator to get in the same kind of

1118
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,560
terminology looking at the same

1119
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,390
categories of data but first different

1120
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,590
uses a different decision making all

1121
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,540
right cuz the socks can be looking at

1122
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,860
from a tactical reason the sea suites

1123
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,000
can be looking at it from strategic

1124
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:59,250
standpoint I think it also depends on if

1125
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,380
you're an organization it just detect

1126
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,380
and reimage whack a mole or do you have

1127
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,120
to detect sees gather evidence find the

1128
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,290
actor find what was disclosed I'm what

1129
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,040
was compromised do you have regular

1130
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:12,870
regulatory constraints about that so it

1131
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,210
could just the detect reimage

1132
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:18,690
whack-a-mole that's far fewer people

1133
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:21,510
than the other situation and I think for

1134
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,610
us certainly echo what Adam said there I

1135
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,010
do have some people that are it's really

1136
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,840
just one or two analysts one of them has

1137
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,280
gone crazy with multi go and they've

1138
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,620
wired it up to the main tools and my

1139
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,510
goodness the magic that they can do and

1140
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,009
they're often running and they're

1141
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,120
they're productive and effective on that

1142
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:39,450
I've got other ones that are teams of

1143
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,910
five six seven I have entire incident

1144
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:44,399
response companies so it really does

1145
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,140
depend on kind of what level they are I

1146
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,150
think there's a significant benefit to

1147
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,190
be had across the spectrum I would

1148
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,310
encourage at least a few people that can

1149
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,800
have a little bit of development shops

1150
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:57,240
some familiarity with Python because at

1151
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,400
some point you are going to probably

1152
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,020
want to write a for loop and you're

1153
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,430
going to want to do some analysis on

1154
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,770
some of this stuff

1155
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:06,509
a lot of us up here we've got api's that

1156
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,910
help with that and you'd be surprised

1157
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,200
how if you have just one or two people

1158
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,210
in there with a little bit of scripting

1159
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,169
knowledge they'll be able to look at and

1160
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,369
they'll take very much the approach that

1161
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,380
Adam was talking about before where

1162
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,000
they're like okay this is tedious I'm

1163
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,260
going to go and automate this for the

1164
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,010
team and your whole team begins to

1165
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:26,339
benefit from that or sometimes they will

1166
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:28,859
locate places within the process where

1167
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:30,750
as an analyst it could be expensive to

1168
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:33,240
pursue a certain line of automate a line

1169
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,859
of research maybe connections by IP

1170
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,078
addresses or name servers both of which

1171
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:39,299
can be a little more tenuous but a good

1172
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,220
coder can reduce the cost of pursuing

1173
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,900
those lines of research and increase

1174
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,419
your chances of yielding something

1175
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,770
useful from it so very useful to kind of

1176
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,200
have somebody on there that can do that

1177
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:50,700
as well let me ask a quick question for

1178
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,859
the room just real quick how many people

1179
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,819
have development coding skills in their

1180
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:58,799
team's weight so that's that's

1181
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:01,050
encouraging for this audience I would

1182
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,640
expect it to kind of go back to Adams

1183
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,349
point kind of threat intelligence for

1184
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,089
all majority of my clients that I work

1185
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:07,230
with they don't have those capabilities

1186
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:09,270
they're gonna have to rely on

1187
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,400
third-party so vendors do need to try to

1188
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,140
come up with force multipliers let me

1189
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,970
take a shot for my own little military

1190
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:19,049
buzz word there but force multipliers

1191
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:20,609
for that lower skill set well so I want

1192
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:22,530
to challenge all of you on the answer

1193
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:25,140
that you gave to the hard question of

1194
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,299
which one should be first because you

1195
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:31,379
all gave wrong answers and then you all

1196
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:34,170
agreed on a right answer and hey i want

1197
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:38,579
to put additional sort of hair on this

1198
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:40,500
so the couple things that you do not

1199
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,819
want to do if you are in the position

1200
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,319
that you said in the question you're

1201
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:46,049
building up this team and you're trying

1202
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,599
to figure out what to do first do not

1203
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:51,450
buy the airplane before you select your

1204
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,270
pilot i have over and over again been

1205
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,368
contacted by people who say my c-suite

1206
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,950
was just hard sold out on the golf

1207
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:02,490
course by some other c-suite networked

1208
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:04,279
person an airplane that is not going to

1209
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:06,629
do the right thing so i'm now looking

1210
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,970
what you really want to do is what Rick

1211
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:10,619
said get the people first and make them

1212
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,970
make this decision because you don't

1213
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,019
hire a craftsman them and tell them

1214
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,578
exactly what tools

1215
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:16,649
you want them to use your hiring them to

1216
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:19,799
get a job done part of that job is to

1217
00:45:16,649 --> 00:45:21,479
determine what what tools to use another

1218
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:24,749
thing that you should not try and do if

1219
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:26,569
you're in the position Rick said is try

1220
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:29,788
to secure an existing infrastructure

1221
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:31,619
there has never been a case any time in

1222
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:33,769
recorded human history that sprinkling

1223
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:37,229
security pixie dust on an existing

1224
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:40,439
construction somehow made it secure if

1225
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:41,999
you didn't build it with an IDs first

1226
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:43,529
you didn't if you didn't build the ids

1227
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:45,299
and the honeypot first and then build

1228
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:46,649
your infrastructure around that you did

1229
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:50,579
it wrong and you have to start over

1230
00:45:46,649 --> 00:45:52,199
budget for that now the counterpoint to

1231
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,909
that though everyone would agree with

1232
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:57,659
that with the reality of us starting

1233
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:59,099
over yeah it just won't happen well okay

1234
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:00,899
so when you have a data center

1235
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,279
consolidation I don't think that you

1236
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:05,159
have some opportunities to re-engineer

1237
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:07,259
thank you for making me clarify that you

1238
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,329
can't always do exactly what you should

1239
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:10,619
do but you can have a certain shining

1240
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:11,729
city on the hill that you're moving

1241
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:14,339
toward whenever you get an opportunity

1242
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:16,519
so we have all been in the position of

1243
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:18,419
having to rebuild the airplane in flight

1244
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:20,038
that's what you're going to have to do

1245
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:21,598
but you have to own that you have to

1246
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,479
admit that to yourself and say by the

1247
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,189
way that's something that I need to be

1248
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:28,739
realistic about the same way you would

1249
00:46:26,189 --> 00:46:29,939
be realistic about DNS SEC or ipv6 it's

1250
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:31,489
not what you're going to do this week

1251
00:46:29,939 --> 00:46:35,328
but it is something you have to do

1252
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:38,009
anyway the two things you should do our

1253
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:40,709
take any of these guys because I know

1254
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:42,779
all of them some of them are already

1255
00:46:40,709 --> 00:46:45,029
existing partners of my company but I

1256
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:47,609
know that they know each other if you

1257
00:46:45,029 --> 00:46:50,039
pick one they're going to either solve

1258
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:53,159
the problems you have or help cross-sell

1259
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:55,949
resale or integrate solutions that other

1260
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,169
people on this panel have so what you

1261
00:46:55,949 --> 00:47:00,059
need is a partner who respects your

1262
00:46:58,169 --> 00:47:03,089
autonomy and wants you to be strong and

1263
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:05,009
these guys are those guys you should

1264
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:08,788
certainly stay away from black box

1265
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:10,409
solutions if if big for consulting firm

1266
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:13,289
says they can solve the problem for you

1267
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:17,639
with a single purchase order then back

1268
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:20,339
away slowly but anyway I did want to say

1269
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,869
none of these guys is the right thing to

1270
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:23,328
start with you need to start with an

1271
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:25,709
investigation of

1272
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:27,689
you need to get your people and let them

1273
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:29,038
decide what to do first they're going to

1274
00:47:27,689 --> 00:47:31,348
end up with all of the solutions

1275
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,689
represented on this panel integrated

1276
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,309
into the final solution which will last

1277
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:37,199
about a month until it is time to

1278
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:39,359
rethink it again because the bad guys

1279
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,219
are waiting for you to settle on a

1280
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,058
solution so that they can begin building

1281
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:47,219
the way around it so anyway thank you

1282
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:51,059
for that I can certainly see that and I

1283
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:52,739
am one of the things that it so yes you

1284
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,839
do need people that can do this and I

1285
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:57,239
bump into conversations with people

1286
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:58,650
sometimes who they're like you know we

1287
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,140
think we want to do is we think I want

1288
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,779
to do the main tools and what's DNS

1289
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,038
again I'm confused and I'm like oh dear

1290
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:08,849
okay this is going to be a tough

1291
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,439
conversation but and actually I also i

1292
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:12,809
often have that conversation in this

1293
00:48:10,439 --> 00:48:15,749
city with some acronyms of various sizes

1294
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:17,459
that will remain unnamed but they are

1295
00:48:15,749 --> 00:48:20,189
good people trying to investigate

1296
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:22,019
badness on the internet they are trying

1297
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:25,469
to protect their networks they are

1298
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:27,058
relatively smart they have perhaps not

1299
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,859
quite the same investigative mind set

1300
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:31,349
that Krebs does but something

1301
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:33,989
approximating that and what I have been

1302
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:37,079
what I've absolutely fascinated by is

1303
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:39,539
how just a couple hours of some internet

1304
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,130
fundamental training will really help to

1305
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:42,479
start kind of launch them off into that

1306
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:44,130
direction and that's one thing that I've

1307
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:45,749
started doing I you know I've tried the

1308
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,969
whole you know I'll teach you how to do

1309
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:49,229
domaintools thing is mean like the first

1310
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:51,569
time I'm talking with a group and

1311
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:53,819
there's some people here who maybe have

1312
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:55,109
had that inflicted on them and I can see

1313
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,519
people looking in the group and they're

1314
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:57,900
just kind of their eyes are glazing over

1315
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:00,569
and I've tried to solve that by bringing

1316
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,449
coffee to the meetings but failing that

1317
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:05,130
I've often in some cases taking a step

1318
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:06,569
back and said you know what let's just

1319
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:08,849
talk about this thing called the

1320
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,949
Internet it's not just a series of tubes

1321
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:13,049
right there's more on the internet than

1322
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:14,400
just pictures of caps and we need to

1323
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:16,079
talk about the ways that this is glued

1324
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,729
together but without too much effort you

1325
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,919
can start to get people to that level of

1326
00:49:17,729 --> 00:49:21,959
kind of baseline competency and then

1327
00:49:19,919 --> 00:49:24,029
from there they can find our tool useful

1328
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,769
and practical and I think that that same

1329
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:29,489
thing may apply to some extent with

1330
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:30,660
other platforms I love that word now

1331
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:33,000
just have to try and throw it out

1332
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,859
sometimes because a lot of platforms

1333
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,020
come with an ideology they come with a

1334
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:39,090
concept they come with a methodology

1335
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,650
that they believe is the way in which to

1336
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,000
do threat intelligence and thread

1337
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,770
investigation appropriately and

1338
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,570
responsively and if that company is

1339
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:47,880
doing their job well then they're going

1340
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,220
to train that they're going to train you

1341
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,540
while using your their product they're

1342
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,310
going to train you around that mindset

1343
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,320
so in many cases you can select your

1344
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,910
vendor based on that mindset and then

1345
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,290
decide from there if that's kind of what

1346
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,170
you want to have replicated within your

1347
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:03,770
team anyone else want to respond to paul

1348
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:05,910
i would say i fully agree with Paul

1349
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:10,980
which is generally a good idea is

1350
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:12,420
generally right you starting with the

1351
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,640
team if you can build a team that's very

1352
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,440
strong on open source tools and has

1353
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,170
relationships they're going to be able

1354
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,320
to do far better than buying commercial

1355
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:23,730
suites for millions up front if you

1356
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,020
can't get that if you get a team that

1357
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,910
ends up being strong managers with

1358
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,900
strong programmers there's a different

1359
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,450
set of tools that they're going to be

1360
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,190
most effective with I imagine that was

1361
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:34,500
the point always going toward a wholly

1362
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,570
agree but have a plan before you hire

1363
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,780
all the people because if your plan

1364
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:42,660
changes after you have 15 full timers

1365
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:45,480
and an integrator and you know a big

1366
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,220
consulting firm then you've made your

1367
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,010
decision too late so you have to figure

1368
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:52,169
out what you're trying to do have enough

1369
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:54,090
people as part of that core team right

1370
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:56,670
we're not we're not necessarily hiring a

1371
00:50:54,090 --> 00:51:00,090
hundred pilots until we have a hundred

1372
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:04,590
airplanes right so i think that plan

1373
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:07,260
plan plan I'll you know repeat something

1374
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:10,140
that mark said the level of

1375
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,630
sophistication right now is frightening

1376
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,220
in the industry people want threat

1377
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:18,120
intelligence they're not sure what it is

1378
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:22,399
yet so now that you're all educated go

1379
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,400
out and teach yes

1380
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,390
yeah go ahead though and then we'll take

1381
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:32,120
one more question after that I was just

1382
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:34,960
gonna add to pull oh good sure yeah i

1383
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:37,370
just want to mention that you know i

1384
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,070
just want to bring up our company and

1385
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:42,970
the problem that we ran into is how do

1386
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:46,370
you convince people to spend money on

1387
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:48,770
what they don't know and so we've looked

1388
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:51,100
into this and to touch on what you were

1389
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:54,530
saying is we we looked into a

1390
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:57,049
quantitative risk assessment a financial

1391
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:00,580
value at risk where we could you know

1392
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:03,560
you can go into a profile assets threats

1393
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,720
the network itself based upon the

1394
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:08,270
security framework 20 critical security

1395
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,399
controls where it actually it's a

1396
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:14,360
mitigation and planning product that

1397
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:17,780
would put a predictive number together

1398
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:20,840
for for the c-level executives so that

1399
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:22,550
they know where to spend their money we

1400
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,550
had to make their wise investments and

1401
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,650
not base it upon fear but on fine answer

1402
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:31,490
did you base that on incidents going

1403
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:34,700
back some amount of time um it's it's

1404
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:36,740
not our product but uh but it's it was

1405
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,240
done by some security research is

1406
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:41,359
similar to what the Wall Street

1407
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,069
financial models that are its predictive

1408
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,540
analysis and it and it gives them some

1409
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,870
sort of number of what they're at risk

1410
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:49,279
of losing over X amount of months yes so

1411
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,440
you can talk to the executive in a way

1412
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,300
they understand perhaps absolutely and

1413
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,130
then company's money and based upon the

1414
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,720
20 critical security controls which

1415
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,880
mitigation techniques you can actually

1416
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,490
put in place to buy down the most amount

1417
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,920
of risk so you can know which products

1418
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,200
to actually go with so I think we have

1419
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:10,330
time for one Paul you want to close this

1420
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,330
out yes I think I do

1421
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:18,850
shutting off my mic is certainly and

1422
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,600
he's still speaking tomorrow to folks

1423
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:24,160
okay so I think that was the best answer

1424
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,140
that I heard to the question that you

1425
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,700
posed to the panel was well what was

1426
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:31,359
just said but I wanted to answer Adam

1427
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:34,149
I'm not arguing for hiring 100 pilots

1428
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,880
before you pick your airplane there is

1429
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:39,460
kind of a spiral theory to this where

1430
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,930
you begin with a leadership team whose

1431
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,940
job is to discover the art of the

1432
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,980
possible and out of that you get a

1433
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:48,010
company strategy and out of that you get

1434
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:50,500
a longer-term plan and the only thing

1435
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:52,780
that differs in the answers I heard

1436
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:56,170
versus what I would have liked to hear

1437
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:59,380
is that it's yet this is you're going in

1438
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,540
position and you are a moving target and

1439
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:03,190
as you zigzag across the sky the bad

1440
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,880
guys are going to build new weapons to

1441
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:08,800
catch any pattern you show them and so

1442
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,480
there's this tendency to believe that

1443
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,630
because you know what your perspective

1444
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,130
losses are you have a some rough order

1445
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,570
of magnitude on the upper bound of what

1446
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,760
you'd be willing to spend to avoid those

1447
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:20,110
losses and that you can simply budget

1448
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,840
for that and this becomes a solved

1449
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:24,940
problem and that's not true these are

1450
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,190
threats that are coming at us not just

1451
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,350
from criminals in our own country but

1452
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:31,570
other governments and criminals in other

1453
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,740
countries and these are before the

1454
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,840
Internet these are the types of threats

1455
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:36,850
that our federal police would have been

1456
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,120
able to protect us from and now we're

1457
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:41,710
all out there living in this Wild West

1458
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,380
scenario where everybody has to go armed

1459
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:47,140
when they're on the internet and you

1460
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,030
this is this is a forever problem the

1461
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,250
bad guys are going to continue to match

1462
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:53,830
their strength to our strength and and

1463
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:56,680
so the only thing I'd say is you will

1464
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:57,970
end up with a hundred pilots and be

1465
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,850
ready for that if you're not willing to

1466
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:02,379
commit to that then just learn learn to

1467
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,060
live with the losses you have and stop

1468
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,130
spending any management bandwidth at all

1469
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:08,529
on this there's there's a serious

1470
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:11,119
approach to this and I recommend it

1471
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:31,970
thank you thank you and thank you to the

1472
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:34,990
analyst and thank you all Expo time be

1473
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,990
back in 20 after
