1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,389
thing that I'm helping other folks to

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,830
build them across a lot of different

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,140
types of collections a lot of different

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,410
problem sets everything from you know

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,290
databases of cable messages to you know

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,320
industrial or like supply chain data

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,599
even some really pretty cool stuff like

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,670
crop reports and agricultural research

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,189
and weather reports mashing up that kind

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,750
of stuff or even up you know media

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,340
exploitation outputs and really kind of

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,179
hairy stuff to try to handle search on

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,439
top of so you know so I'm you know I'm a

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,540
builder you know that's that's how I

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,969
look at multi go and multi go kung-fu

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,989
and how I come at this topic so you know

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,940
it's it's a I think the last panel was

18
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,199
terrific I'm very excited that I've got

19
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,269
something pretty different to share with

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
you it's not a cloak and dagger story

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,160
you know it's not a takedown it's a to

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,420
look at multi go kung-fu and you know

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,190
open source intelligence for that

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,010
perspective you know we've been looking

25
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,899
at this for about a year and we've been

26
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,370
getting a lot of a lot of our customers

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,379
to thread into analysts that we work

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,449
with saying hey we're using multi go a

29
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,339
lot in our environment it's a terrific

30
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,350
capability we think you guys should have

31
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,850
a strong integration doing what you're

32
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,770
doing a record of future in this product

33
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,449
and so from my perspective trying to

34
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,408
figure out exactly what are they doing

35
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,790
with multi go

36
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,220
you know why is that important what

37
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,840
problems is that solving how can we you

38
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,560
know help them solve that with our

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,360
integration as best as possible so you

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,189
know over the course that year a lot of

41
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,020
analysts have been willing to talk with

42
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,490
us you know show me what they've been up

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,990
to look at what we've been doing with

44
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,119
the integration critique it say hey this

45
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,548
/ - this part's bad don't you improve it

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,079
you know and this in this way so in

47
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,759
today's talk what I want to do is sort

48
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,829
of you know pay that forward to all of

49
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,360
you and I think you know there's some

50
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,279
some lessons that we've figured out and

51
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,649
learned and the integration between

52
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,640
multigo and our product that are really

53
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,869
pretty general you know it doesn't

54
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,549
really matter I think in terms of

55
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,590
looking at these whether you're using in

56
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,930
a multi go or some other link analysis

57
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,579
product or whether using record a future

58
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,689
or not or I mean we're all using Google

59
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,350
so everybody's doing open source

60
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,750
intelligence to some extent so so that's

61
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,770
what I have for you I'm actually you

62
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,329
know it's because we're talking about

63
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,669
integration patterns and user experience

64
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,899
I didn't want to just give you a screen

65
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,670
shot demo so I'm actually gonna give you

66
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,680
a live demo which is either brave or

67
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,750
foolhardy we'll see how it works out

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
and so I'm just going to set up the

69
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,050
topic a little bit and then we'll jump

70
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,530
into that and I'll show you in action

71
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,209
what we're talking about here so I'm

72
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,319
going to circle around to multigo but

73
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,920
I'm going to start with the you know the

74
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:32,488
open source exploitation and I start

75
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,458
here if you're you know an extreme

76
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,890
skeptic about the value of open source

77
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:39,420
information as part of threat Intel I

78
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,298
hate to disappoint you but I'm I'm not

79
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,440
gonna try to disprove that with some

80
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,030
sort of evidence that you know X

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,620
percentage of the information that you

82
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,440
need to do your work is an open source

83
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,870
or there's something like that I think

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,630
at least in this community we're mostly

85
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,849
past that conversation and that there is

86
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,349
value it's not the totality of value you

87
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,290
know it's it's it's a tool and the

88
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,609
toolkit you know I think when I'm at a

89
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,750
cocktail party and I say you know we're

90
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,819
collecting information from the web

91
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,019
running it through NLP you know

92
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,310
producing information that's useful for

93
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,680
security people say wow you can you

94
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,959
actually do that but not so much in this

95
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,510
community but there is skepticism still

96
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,970
and I think when I think it on here you

97
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,590
know this is the this is the one

98
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,690
football reference in the presentation

99
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,639
right so this is the logo from a bunny

100
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,069
Morning Quarterback they had a great

101
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,630
quote from there you know all twenty-two

102
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,790
film analysts on Monday and after the

103
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,049
Superbowl he said everybody's favorite

104
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,630
hindsight is everybody's favorite

105
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,549
perspective and I think this actually

106
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,410
came up in yesterday's discussion in one

107
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,790
of the sessions that a lot of the

108
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,530
information you find an open source is

109
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,328
actually reporting about something that

110
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,919
that has already happened you know

111
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,930
somebody observed an event they went to

112
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,370
the web they wrote it down maybe some

113
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,090
device you know observe some technical

114
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,919
behavior they've published that out so

115
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,989
you know by definition that for that

116
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,280
particular situation is not Intel you

117
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,510
know Intel us before it's news that's

118
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,290
now an observation of what happened in

119
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,090
the past now you know you can take that

120
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,858
information and say you know here's the

121
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,870
context here's what's been observed

122
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,389
you know therefore the trend is this and

123
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,519
you do that that type of analysis work

124
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,750
and drive Intel for that information but

125
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,700
that's you know something quite

126
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,738
different and more complicated so I

127
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,680
think this is the the second quote I

128
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,570
want to pull up here this is it's a

129
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,310
tweet from medical ACS and I think this

130
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,289
sums up this this response to

131
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,970
open-source Intel free well says it's

132
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,240
not anecdotal evidence it

133
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,700
artisanal data which is you know so yeah

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,260
you can find some information in open

135
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,030
sources you can you can you know

136
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,590
extrapolate a trend you can figure

137
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,140
something out but what are we really

138
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,200
talking about here is this some you know

139
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,810
like small handcrafted your small

140
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,420
batches of threat intelligence that that

141
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,150
craftsmen can produce or is this really

142
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,530
something that can be you know done over

143
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,929
and over again you know by by mere

144
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,909
mortals you know I said it's to put it

145
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,940
in business terms as you know consistent

146
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,070
and repeatable process so I mean this is

147
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,770
the question that that I think about a

148
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,330
lot like how can we take exploitation of

149
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,669
public you know open source information

150
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,530
and make it something that you can do

151
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,910
over and over again do it with a level

152
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,500
of confidence that I've done enough of

153
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,080
this and now I can pivot over into other

154
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,160
other sources other methods or just you

155
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,580
know to say we're done with that let's

156
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,970
move into action so you know why would

157
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,830
this be hard and I guess you know don't

158
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,990
get me started right but I'm gonna pick

159
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,250
a couple of things I think one of the

160
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,080
obvious you know things ought to say and

161
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,490
we know this about there's no end of the

162
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,380
internet you don't get to that page and

163
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,419
say okay my collection work and open

164
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,980
source is done you know I've done enough

165
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,710
and now I can wrap it up and move to the

166
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,790
next it just doesn't work that way and I

167
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,289
think you know the you know the other

168
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,680
point here that you probably have heard

169
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,690
before it's a fairly obvious one is that

170
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,100
it's not a static web right you know

171
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,469
maybe the piece of information that you

172
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,330
needed for your research free analysis

173
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,430
was there last week but it's not there

174
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,840
anymore you know maybe it's it's going

175
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,390
to be there you know five minutes after

176
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,150
you get done with your search you know

177
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,260
it's a very dynamic environment and I

178
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,870
think as you start to look more closely

179
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,430
at this you know there's each different

180
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,380
type of data that's publicly available

181
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,270
and a lot of the speakers have talked

182
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,979
about their discipline and domain you

183
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,750
know the the slice of that information

184
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,300
that they work with and we specialize in

185
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,780
text written by human beings for the

186
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,120
most part it has its own sort of

187
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,289
challenges around collection processing

188
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,870
understanding you know what's what's

189
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,800
novel what's interesting what's abnormal

190
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,930
you know what's interesting from an

191
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,870
Intel perspective so you know you get

192
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,979
into this whole set of problems around

193
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,289
exploiting public information that are

194
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,270
pretty specialized I think from the the

195
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,380
analyst standpoint that's good I I don't

196
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,940
want to be doing that you know

197
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,800
don't work and a huge organization where

198
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,060
there's a whole other staff that's

199
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,010
charged with collection and processing

200
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,930
and I'm just the analyst this is also my

201
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,180
job too maybe that's what it's like in

202
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,980
government but this is industry you know

203
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,780
it's it's a different different playing

204
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,340
field so you say you know are there are

205
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,960
people that I can work with around that

206
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,489
and there are there are a lot of folks

207
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,930
like us that are specialists with you

208
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,030
know one area or another of open source

209
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,200
collection and exploitation and then you

210
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,299
get into the whole question of you know

211
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,870
what's my loadout you know what what

212
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,100
matters are these things overlapping one

213
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,900
of the speakers yesterday Alex talked

214
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,890
about this you know from the threat IQ

215
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,359
so this set of challenges with open

216
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,370
source exploitation this is you know

217
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,950
sort of where I spend most of my you

218
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,730
know waking hours working and trying to

219
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,110
figure out how we can bring a better

220
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,420
solution but I want to pivot for this

221
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,830
talk there's something different which

222
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,570
is you know the I think there's a whole

223
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,729
other set of challenges which relate

224
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,290
relate us back to multi go and that's

225
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,630
that you know this open source stuff

226
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,160
it's not that it doesn't exist in a

227
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,230
vacuum and it's not the whole the whole

228
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,510
set of information and even if you you

229
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,430
know say that 90% of the information

230
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,020
that you would need is available in

231
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,060
public and open sources you still need

232
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,250
the other 10% I think we have opened out

233
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,260
enough software projects to know that it

234
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,850
can be 90% ever complete and 0%

235
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,630
delivered and you know there's no value

236
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:59,190
there right so you need the rest and so

237
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,530
you know this is what it actually looks

238
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,210
like you know the the speakers in the

239
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,369
panel before we're talking about this

240
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,349
how they had tips they had information

241
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,790
from private collections and they were

242
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,610
looking at other you know open source

243
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,780
and other other media this is how it

244
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,520
actually works you know the the

245
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,380
investigation usually doesn't start from

246
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,270
open source it starts from other more

247
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,880
targeted information it's an iterative

248
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,200
process you say I've got some you know

249
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,930
got an incident that's that's been

250
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,789
observed I've got some observables ipys

251
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,710
domains hashes something like that don't

252
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,030
really have much context around that can

253
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,039
I look at open source and get some more

254
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,360
information and then maybe I dip it

255
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,010
right back you know look at private

256
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,180
collections maybe I take that and look

257
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,750
at some of the research discretion

258
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,309
subscriptions that I have access to so

259
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,070
this is what you know if you want to

260
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,750
have a repeatable consistent you know a

261
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,880
process for open source exploitation

262
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,350
it's going to have to look like this and

263
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,200
then I think the question that you get

264
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,850
to is so you know it's iterative but how

265
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,920
many iterations am I going to be able to

266
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,870
to pull off you know what is what does

267
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,969
it actually practically look like and so

268
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,600
I wanted to pull up this kind of a cool

269
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,889
picture it's a little dim but I think

270
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:13,860
you know you can probably still make it

271
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:15,600
out anybody recognize that very close so

272
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,630
it's I it's from homeland it's a picture

273
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,639
of Carrie mathison's sort of wall of

274
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,339
intelligence you know full of all sorts

275
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,899
of I guess in the story classified

276
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,899
information that she's brought home and

277
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,220
in a second

278
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,579
hopefully we'll come right back into the

279
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,699
slideshow so that's fiction and that's

280
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,959
great that makes me happy

281
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:51,899
but I think you know when I look at it

282
00:09:42,959 --> 00:10:00,779
oh we were having fun this is the great

283
00:09:51,899 --> 00:10:02,100
part about live demos okay so the UH the

284
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,509
other part that strikes me is this

285
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,999
really fictional is if you think about

286
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:18,620
the I'm sorry kinda never rains but it

287
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:20,699
pours huh are we back okay

288
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,089
if you think about the sheer amount of

289
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:25,529
time that she would have had to put into

290
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,529
sourcing all of this you know

291
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:30,420
information processing and collating it

292
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,160
organizing and so forth and how many

293
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,259
investigations actually get this level

294
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,939
of focus very few and you know the the

295
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,529
amount of work that would have needed to

296
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:42,389
go into bringing all this information

297
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:44,160
together it's very I think I find it

298
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,970
very impossible it just doesn't it's not

299
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,550
gonna happen

300
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,290
very often to go to that degree it's

301
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,399
because you you know again the panelists

302
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,949
in the last session we're talking about

303
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
how there's a friction there's a

304
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:56,670
coefficient of friction in getting

305
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,019
access to this information sharing is

306
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,000
great we're gonna do more of it we're

307
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,129
gonna automate more of it it still takes

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,809
time to bring information in and out of

309
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,949
the the Intel space that you're in the

310
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:07,889
analysis space that you're working with

311
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:10,969
so if we're gonna make this o cent work

312
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:13,470
you know repeatable effective

313
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,759
predictable etc we're gonna have to

314
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,819
drive down the coefficient of friction

315
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:21,360
and so we look at that you know we got

316
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:22,469
our bobsled uh-huh it's an optimization

317
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,449
problem right so we got to focus

318
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,589
somewhere and you know and what we've

319
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:27,839
been doing with our integration we're

320
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:30,029
focusing on the operations that happen

321
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,589
very frequently and the operations that

322
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,879
happen at the the inception of the

323
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:34,350
investigation right cuz they always

324
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,189
happen and it's these sorts of things

325
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,829
it's uh you got a set of in front you've

326
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,939
got a data point or a name or a key and

327
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:43,469
you want to probe the collection see if

328
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:44,519
there's even anything there to start

329
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,519
pulling on the piece of string and

330
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,050
following it down maybe you have a set

331
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,310
of observables that you have right now

332
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,689
you want to see what else might be

333
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,339
linked to it to potentially expand the

334
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,720
set of observables and then you know

335
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,720
bring it back against log data or

336
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,800
network data or other collections and

337
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,149
obviously there's there's going to be

338
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,319
pivoting you know got your in a

339
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,339
particular area you want to pivot the

340
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,260
investigation to go in a different

341
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,370
direction and at the end of the day it's

342
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,649
not just about you know of course

343
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,250
collecting more data and so forth it's

344
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,089
about bringing it down to the set of

345
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,740
observables that are actually indicators

346
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,860
to compromise their indicators of recon

347
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,610
or they're going to have value for a

348
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,260
detection or block rules so here's our

349
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,880
gonna bring it back around to multigo so

350
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,360
I think there's a link between all of

351
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,470
these sorts of issues and and why we've

352
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,209
been hearing so much interest in

353
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,920
excitement around multigo and actually

354
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,420
want to pause right here and ask Rick

355
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,610
was you know you asked about multi go

356
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,949
use I'm curious uh in terms of you know

357
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,420
link analysis tools in general it could

358
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,360
be you know about take oh and let's

359
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,219
notebook Palantir centrifuge Thetis even

360
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,170
like a like efi a graph you know tool

361
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,480
just show of hands how many people are

362
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:54,329
are currently or have work with a tool

363
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,560
like that it almost good so when i jump

364
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:56,910
into the demo i'll do the first path a

365
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,010
little bit more slowly to sort of

366
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,360
situate it for the the folks who aren't

367
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,020
familiar with those tools but you know

368
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,480
we'll go pretty quick so with multi go i

369
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,459
think the first reason i mean there are

370
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,350
a lot of great tools out there that are

371
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:12,359
link analysis capabilities one of the

372
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,640
things about multi go is you know we

373
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,990
it's it's very available you just go to

374
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,880
the website you download it it's pretty

375
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,290
affordable you're not gonna have to go

376
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,640
you know three levels up in the

377
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,160
organization to get sign off on the

378
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,959
purchase order which you know I mean I

379
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,250
think that's just in that accessibility

380
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,410
is an advantage and why it keeps popping

381
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,450
up you can learn to do these operations

382
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,310
in multi go go work in a different

383
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,079
organization you can take those skills

384
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,779
with you so that's cool I think that's

385
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,459
what's driving some of the interest all

386
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,529
of the conversations in the last panel

387
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,000
about the difficulties of you know you

388
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,560
here's some information and confidence

389
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,149
and you got to figure out how you can

390
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,160
share it and bring it into this analysis

391
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:49,019
space there are a lot of you know human

392
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,100
judgments that the analyst is making and

393
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,110
I think you know for better or for worse

394
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,940
multigo is not part of some great big

395
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,070
system with a database on the back end

396
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,810
of it the investigation files sitting on

397
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,920
your hard drive right so I think to put

398
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,599
it this way it's sort of analysts owned

399
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,890
and operated you can make those choices

400
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,400
you can put the data into the

401
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,319
investigate

402
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,910
whatever form whatever redacted form

403
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,370
that you think it's useful without

404
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,870
having to get somebody else to do an IT

405
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,570
integration or whatever else might you

406
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,850
know delay the process by until it's no

407
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,200
longer relevant when you're putting that

408
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,270
information in I think this is pretty

409
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,280
cool you know you can almost like

410
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,689
sneakernet but you just copy-paste i'll

411
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,220
Teague will guess at what you you know

412
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,260
what type of information you've just put

413
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,270
into the investigation might get it

414
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,500
wrong you can correct it but that level

415
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,850
of you know there's not much friction

416
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,490
right there which is really useful

417
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,360
and then lastly from the perspective of

418
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,280
of us as an int Oh information provider

419
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,960
it's got a good set of interfaces around

420
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,990
plugging in so that we can make our

421
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,530
information really accessible there now

422
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,240
I wanted to pause here and say obviously

423
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,339
the the folks that I'm talking with are

424
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,810
interested in multigo because they're

425
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,830
talking to me about multigo because

426
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,020
they're interesting getting a record of

427
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,880
future data into it but you know aside

428
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,380
from using the built-in stuff and you

429
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,360
know interest in what we're doing what

430
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,830
do you think is that the most that the

431
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,630
top collection that I always hear people

432
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:08,660
talking about wanted to integrate with

433
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:10,070
their multigo deploys any hazard a guess

434
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,569
yes

435
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,180
so for everybody who is saying yesterday

436
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,400
that your own logs your own data is that

437
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,989
the most you know sort of highest value

438
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,850
most untapped source of information that

439
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,410
you have out there that's what I keep

440
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,870
hearing people talking about in terms of

441
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,819
what they want to hook into multigo but

442
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,290
I think it's pretty cool you know it's

443
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,530
some of that the messages are getting

444
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,870
out but you know in terms of wanting to

445
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,400
demo these interaction problem to you

446
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,720
the interaction patterns to you have put

447
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,430
me a little bit of a pickle because I

448
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,170
don't have access to their internal log

449
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,400
data to show you how you know what we're

450
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,870
doing and what they're doing mixed

451
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:47,699
together in mash up which is really the

452
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:50,370
point of the talk so it's lucky enough

453
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,950
Mark Hendricks from domain tools gave us

454
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,120
access to his transform set for you know

455
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,100
for purposes of the demo so what I'm

456
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,110
going to show you is sort of using our

457
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,580
information using his information you're

458
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,560
the to collections to pivot back and

459
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,150
forth to show you the patterns of what

460
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,250
you know the folks weren't working with

461
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,449
are doing between our transforms their

462
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,240
internal transforms that they're

463
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,350
building and other transform sets so you

464
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,460
know think about it both for the

465
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,780
perspective of what you're seeing with

466
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,460
East your transform sets but from that

467
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,339
because that's that's what I'm seeing

468
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,400
people doing

469
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,170
and with that we're gonna leave the

470
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,520
trouble with slides part of the

471
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,880
presentation behind and I can actually

472
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:29,199
jump into the live demo yeah okay ah

473
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:36,279
excellent

474
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:37,750
I'll take his reset and I need to turn

475
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:40,770
on screen mirroring so you can actually

476
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,770
see what I'm doing that'll be helpful

477
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,550
and how's the contrast event okay good

478
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:07,790
okay so let's see and I'm gonna see if I

479
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:09,678
can make this a little bit bigger yeah I

480
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,760
think big enough you can you can see

481
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,839
most of what's going on so so for

482
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,300
anybody who has a user link analysis

483
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,309
tool I mean the main workspace here is a

484
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,109
graph it's a set of entities that are

485
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:22,879
related together in ways that that you

486
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,708
as the analyst you know have observed

487
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,270
have validated you can add notes you can

488
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:28,520
you know describe the links that's the

489
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,629
basic basic concept and you can reach

490
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,309
out into all sorts of different

491
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,320
collections like ours or your own data

492
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,000
to pull more information back you know

493
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,100
increase the set of information that

494
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,150
you're working with probe some areas of

495
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,459
it you know if it turns out to be

496
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,870
irrelevant prune it delete it out that's

497
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,120
that's what this this type of capability

498
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,540
is all about so I thought it would start

499
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:53,419
with in a sort of a simple path here to

500
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:56,960
get us rollin this is a vicinity

501
00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:00,470
represents a vulnerability you know CBE

502
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,720
2014 Oh 497 so let's say that you're

503
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,280
gonna get a an alert this one's a bit

504
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,720
old of course right let's say that you

505
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,490
get alert through this one it says you

506
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,740
know quite dangerous and you need to

507
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,900
look into it so if you drop it into a

508
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,730
tool like this one of the things that

509
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,720
you would do with with OSINT is just you

510
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:20,570
know reach out to Google they if you

511
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,450
hadn't already there's the the second

512
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,790
hit here is the NPD you know there it is

513
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,730
impact ten exploitability ten so this

514
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,860
one must be really bad so you know

515
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,570
informations accurate let me dig in and

516
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,949
the next thing you would do is then want

517
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,700
to reach out into another collection to

518
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,480
see if you can get more information

519
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,250
about it so the way we're hooking in in

520
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,780
the way multigo structures this each

521
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,190
tool is a little bit different but they

522
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,260
call it a transform and that's where we

523
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,179
plug in so you know we've got a little

524
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,210
piece in here where it's our recorded

525
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:51,650
future you know data connections you can

526
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:57,700
say you know what's what's available out

527
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,700
there pull back first let's see

528
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,270
I am going to have to adjust the window

529
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,270
here sorry about that

530
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,379
one sec because there's some interesting

531
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:17,160
stuff going on on the right hand side of

532
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:19,310
the screen that you can't see let's try

533
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,310
that

534
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,270
and

535
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,049
okay

536
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,289
so 703 documents there's a lot of

537
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,998
information out there

538
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,889
I got a slider here you know maybe I'll

539
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:46,759
pull let's say that the most recent

540
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:48,408
fifty so I'm going to run another you

541
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,909
know data innovation step here and say I

542
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:51,769
actually want to get the documents back

543
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,480
from recorded future whatever we picked

544
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:54,830
up you know through harvesting open

545
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,350
sources on the web where people are

546
00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:02,269
talking about this particular CBE and

547
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:05,449
you know there's a lot that's the the

548
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:10,399
top fifty I can select them all let's

549
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:13,580
see I you know grab this node select the

550
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:15,139
children look at the details so you can

551
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,960
scan across the the titles of these

552
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:19,939
different things there's quite a few

553
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,830
different pieces of malware that are

554
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,299
being talked about here so maybe a

555
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,489
useful thing to do next in this

556
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:28,820
investigation would be to grab you know

557
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:30,830
all of those documents and say why don't

558
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,739
we reach out and and say if there are

559
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,389
references to malware that could be

560
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:36,980
malware family names it could be

561
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:39,408
categories of malware it could be you

562
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,509
know sort of it attack steps you know

563
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:44,149
that are often referred to in the same

564
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:46,639
sort of ways let's pull all of that

565
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:48,649
information back and sure enough there's

566
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:50,238
a lot you know there's a lot more that

567
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,289
I've just expanded and I'm not gonna

568
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:53,690
read every single one of these obviously

569
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:54,830
it's way too much but it gives me a way

570
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,210
to screen the information that's

571
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,799
available to me very rapidly without

572
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,109
without having to do the reading the

573
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,629
Machine already did it so let's say look

574
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:04,158
at these here all that the pieces of

575
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,389
malware that are referred to one way or

576
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,999
the other and the information that I

577
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:10,820
pulled back you know exploit kits so

578
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:12,919
forth let's say that you know angler was

579
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,899
a specific interest some folks that we

580
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,580
work with have been you know looking at

581
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,748
that one is a specific investigation so

582
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:22,009
maybe that's the place that I want to

583
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:24,739
dig in so find that particular node

584
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:27,169
there's angler move up in the graph you

585
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:28,999
know so what are the parents let's take

586
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:33,190
a look at that again in the overview you

587
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:36,940
know what do we have going on here right

588
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,940
and I'm actually gonna

589
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,290
so here's a particular document let's

590
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,190
say this one looks interesting and so

591
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:50,168
now I've got some information over here

592
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,610
publication information the title you

593
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,530
know fragments I can understand why it

594
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,479
is that the transform pulled this

595
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,889
information back and you know obviously

596
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,049
I'm going to want to look at this in its

597
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,049
original form so I'm out linked right so

598
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,370
and I can read back here on the the

599
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,230
discussion of how this this particular

600
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,330
vulnerability and this exploit fit

601
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,580
together so I want to stop here you know

602
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,199
that's the basic orientation to you know

603
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,970
what link analysis tool looks like what

604
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,820
it looks like when you've plugged in a

605
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,580
set of intervention interfaces to a

606
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,428
collection like ours now a couple things

607
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,840
that we can have learned along the way

608
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,120
there's a lot that we do that's you know

609
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,220
sort of more advanced analytics or other

610
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,449
analysis of the information and we

611
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,460
started out trying to fit a lot more of

612
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,320
this into the product but as we as we

613
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,790
work with the integration I think that

614
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,320
the transparency and the simplicity

615
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,809
really came through is something that we

616
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,710
needed to focus on that you know some of

617
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:43,270
the people working with this information

618
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,040
are gonna know our product but a lot of

619
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,540
aren't you know it's going in here and

620
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,909
in large part so it can be portable and

621
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,200
move to IR or move to forensics or move

622
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,669
to a lot of other places so it's really

623
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,100
important you know in this integration

624
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:56,169
to keep it simple so that's I think one

625
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,070
thing that we you know initially thought

626
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,650
we should head in a different direction

627
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:02,590
but then you know I have pivoted that's

628
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:06,190
a lesson I think you know another thing

629
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,990
here is if you think about how these

630
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,580
these actual you know pieces of

631
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,620
integration functionality are plugged in

632
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,080
you know so how is it that we ended up

633
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:18,219
you know in this right right menu here

634
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:21,280
as a as a transform so the way multigo

635
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,020
plugs this in and then this is where it

636
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,820
is you can manage your transforms you

637
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,549
can you know discover some out on the

638
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,710
web you can create a local transform and

639
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:31,270
we actually started out here where a lot

640
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,040
of folks were saying hey you know

641
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,020
they're different ways to do this but if

642
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,520
you do local transforms like literally

643
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,080
what's happening is this tool is going

644
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,790
to shell out you know onto the local

645
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,860
computer it's gonna run code right there

646
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,570
it'll do whatever it's gonna do and from

647
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,459
the analyst perspective they can see

648
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,689
exactly what it's doing they want to see

649
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,890
what's going on they can read the code

650
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,480
if they want to tweak it they can adjust

651
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,230
it you know they have fulcrum control

652
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,090
and transparency

653
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,059
that sounds like a great idea let's go

654
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,830
down that path turns out your you know

655
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,330
and this is kind of one of these in

656
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,668
hindsight it's obvious you go into

657
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,409
porting right this is Mac a lot of

658
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:04,090
people are running on Kali Linux some

659
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,410
people are running on Windows some

660
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,580
people have Python installed other

661
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,230
people are running on a box where they

662
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,110
don't have local ad band they can't

663
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,150
change in this lock down so turned out

664
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,790
to be you know sort of right concept but

665
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:19,540
wrong implementation so have moved back

666
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:22,270
toward the transform server where you

667
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,928
know we have got this staged out on a

668
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,668
server

669
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,620
our partners at malformities Labs

670
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:28,600
provide this where you know it's the

671
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,059
analyst all I need to know is the URL

672
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,678
let's go pick those up connect it in all

673
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:34,389
of the code lives there I don't have to

674
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,610
patch it you know its platform neutral

675
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,650
for my perspective which is you know

676
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,240
really optimizing for the fact that

677
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,280
people want to have that level of

678
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,900
transparency and and control around how

679
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,000
the integration works but they're way

680
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,650
too busy too busy to install it too busy

681
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,090
to maintain it so even though it's a

682
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,950
different optimization this is what's

683
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:54,668
worked out much better so that's you

684
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,740
know a lesson learned to share I think

685
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,760
then the you've also noticed I think as

686
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,250
I was stepping through here that it was

687
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,169
very much like step step step you know

688
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,660
here's the CVE what documents do we have

689
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,610
what pieces of malware the operations

690
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,040
are really fine-grained which you know

691
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,479
seems tedious you know why would I want

692
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,580
that why would I not want an operation

693
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,580
that takes six steps instead of one that

694
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,689
there's six steps individually so that's

695
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,909
another interesting thing that it's

696
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,770
turned out that by us taking our

697
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:22,860
capabilities and providing them in a

698
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,570
really fine grained atomic way that way

699
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,860
it actually gives that same flexibility

700
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,129
that we're trying to do with the source

701
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,689
code distribution in another way because

702
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,700
multigo has in it a way to build macros

703
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,200
so you can take you know a set of

704
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,760
operations that we provide a set of

705
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,230
operations that you've built yourself a

706
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,090
set of operations sydney or something

707
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,679
like domain tools offers and mash them

708
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,720
up to do exactly what you need to do and

709
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,309
speed up that that loop where you're

710
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,080
probing one collection and pivoting to

711
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,710
another and probing that so let me show

712
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,149
you that so I've got here you know it's

713
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,620
an example let's say about an incident

714
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,799
report these three IPS are doing

715
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:00,040
something fishy might be c2 not really

716
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,540
clear now I'm actually likely to get the

717
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,220
information in a different format your

718
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,879
nots not as a multi go graph but just do

719
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,789
some text

720
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:08,228
you know email some other database

721
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:10,179
system so I'm just gonna show you I

722
00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:12,849
grabbed that in the clipboard opening up

723
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:15,009
a new graph pasting it and multigo

724
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:16,899
figured out you know it's uh it's got

725
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:20,169
the IP nature in the string so it

726
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:21,668
classified as IPS so the first thing

727
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,349
that I'm gonna do here is say and I

728
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:25,269
built these you know these macros these

729
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:26,739
mashups for you know for the sans event

730
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:28,659
here that's why they're all labeled sans

731
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:30,039
I'm gonna say you know let's just probe

732
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:33,129
directly into record a future see what

733
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:34,658
we can get around these IDs and you know

734
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:35,948
I get a little bit so here's where it's

735
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,349
taking multiple steps you know I got a

736
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:39,669
document pulled the source hold some

737
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:42,099
domain names that are inside of it you

738
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:44,049
know w3 not to interesting these two

739
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,509
look fishy so that's you know a little

740
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:49,059
bit more interesting but you know not

741
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:50,259
not a ton of information yet another

742
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:51,759
thing that I could do is do a whois

743
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:54,759
lookup right try to figure out what the

744
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,139
the net block is above this IP and use

745
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:57,279
that as a way to probe record a future

746
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:59,589
and see you know there's some reporting

747
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,219
around that a s number so you know let's

748
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:05,979
do that went out and got the net blocks

749
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:07,839
actually that close that so you can see

750
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:09,629
it more clearly and these three nodes or

751
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,729
the a s numbers right so this one here

752
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:15,119
you can see you know about 400 reports

753
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:23,349
looks like a kind of dodgy neighborhood

754
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:24,999
this one here yep sorry there we go

755
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:26,649
this one here only two so that's pretty

756
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:29,019
interesting this latest report from Fred

757
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:30,789
expert you know with these these domain

758
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,199
names is from a net block that doesn't

759
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:33,609
have much you know history of

760
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:35,619
exploitation at least in our data set

761
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:37,029
and this one over here has got over a

762
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:38,769
thousand so that's that's definitely a

763
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:40,059
bad neighborhood so I don't think I

764
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:41,829
really need to go deep into those I've

765
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:45,158
gotten a sense of what's going on but

766
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:46,899
maybe pop back up to those IPs and then

767
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,629
here I'll show you how you can move

768
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,738
across so you know we don't have a ton

769
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:52,569
of information around them but maybe I

770
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:55,329
can look over in the domain tools

771
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:57,309
collection and say those domain tools

772
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:59,379
have domain a domain information on

773
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,549
these site keys and sure enough they got

774
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:03,789
a couple so now I've got some new

775
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:06,759
observables Chateau mal com alpha Moby

776
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:07,839
calm kind of interesting record a future

777
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:11,190
didn't have anything directly around

778
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,928
those but domain tools actually has

779
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,309
historic information as well so you know

780
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,659
let's see look into their information on

781
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:20,168
historic IPs mapped to the

782
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:23,769
domains now we're getting somewhere

783
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:25,239
right so about you know four more around

784
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,950
chateau mall you know some more from

785
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,299
alpha Moby actually I've got another

786
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,309
document from a recorded future that it

787
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:35,200
pulled out to write so here's something

788
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:37,599
titled ABC of e-commerce comm reposted

789
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,629
by host Anna calm they report who's

790
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,158
hosting it another domain name so let's

791
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:46,570
say you know let's look back into that

792
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:50,229
and do we have some historic IDs around

793
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:51,340
that and now here we got something we're

794
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,129
interesting right

795
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,570
not only is that IP domain lame name

796
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:57,219
historically linked back to one of the

797
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,349
same IPS that was shared by alpha Moby

798
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,659
it actually connects over into Chateau

799
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:03,549
mall com if there's an IP that was

800
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,679
shared in common between those two so

801
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:09,399
I've now found a non-obvious linkage

802
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:13,019
between those two IPs and well a whole

803
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,768
lot of information down here around

804
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,919
exploitation observed around this

805
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:19,629
particular IP which is pretty nasty so

806
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,039
or at least has been behaving badly for

807
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:22,899
quite a long time so I can get a better

808
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,559
sense by looking at those children of

809
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:27,939
you know what kind of what kind of bad

810
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,840
information has been observed on that

811
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:34,440
same infrastructure right so this is you

812
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,249
know it's one example of mash up the

813
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,080
putting together these these little

814
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:39,639
macro scripts that run between you know

815
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,460
markztools the domain tool stuff and our

816
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,748
stuff is uh it's really pretty trivial

817
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,369
you know there's a simple scripting

818
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:47,229
engine in here there's a WYSIWYG builder

819
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:49,029
for it and I think that's where this

820
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:51,399
gets really really interesting where you

821
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:52,659
can say you know this work of taking a

822
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:53,949
set of information and casting it

823
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,330
against a bunch of different collections

824
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,389
and seeing if there's a way to advance

825
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,859
the investigation and then pivot back

826
00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:01,149
may be useful but you know it's not

827
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:02,918
something I'm ever gonna do by hand

828
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:06,939
unless I can apply this sort of

829
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:13,139
automation so I'm just going to show you

830
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:15,340
one last one as a way to wrap this up

831
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:16,689
the example so far I've been showing are

832
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,129
places where you at the starting point

833
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,599
you had a pretty good notion of what the

834
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:21,279
you know what the observable was what

835
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,470
the entry point was for the

836
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,149
investigation you know it turns out

837
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,129
that's not often not always the case

838
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:28,060
so I wanted to show you a couple of

839
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:30,250
examples

840
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,770
first you know here one of the

841
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,360
challenges we come back to lowering the

842
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,160
friction between you know moving between

843
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,169
our open source collection other

844
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,670
collections your internal data said you

845
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,960
know everybody's got a slightly

846
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,320
different way of classifying and

847
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,010
describing the information right so here

848
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,820
and if I grab you know some phrases here

849
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,680
one of the things that we've recently

850
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,669
built into the integration and I think

851
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,710
is turned out turn out to be a pretty

852
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,150
useful pattern so I can say you know

853
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,420
your clandestine Fox

854
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,680
you know Occidental annan ghost you know

855
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,510
my head they're all different types of

856
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,030
groups you know once a company once said

857
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,129
an operation or campaign and others

858
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,490
activist group let's say I can't

859
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,360
remember exactly how record a future

860
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,860
organizes its information around that

861
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,399
and I don't want to go and have to

862
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:17,080
hassle with figuring that out to be able

863
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,060
to run a transform here and just say hey

864
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,340
your map it tell me how you describe

865
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,720
that entity and that gives me a better a

866
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,220
better entry point into your collection

867
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,870
so you know there you go it's been

868
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
mapped out turns out we have you know

869
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,689
two ways I'm talking about Occidental

870
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,490
you know the parent company and its

871
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,530
subsidiary and they're you know there

872
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:35,470
you have it and then you know obviously

873
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,730
there's gonna be a limit on whatever it

874
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,980
is the information that we've been able

875
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,210
to organize and classify in advance and

876
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,410
then you'll pick up something else in

877
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,140
your investigation and it's not really

878
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,450
clear what it is right so here's you

879
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,460
know let's say it's a string that came

880
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,450
out of a piece of malware you know that

881
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,860
you have malware sample you're on the

882
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,750
strings on it like you know what is this

883
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,110
to be able to take this and run it

884
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:58,090
against recorded future or other

885
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,469
collections right and say have you got

886
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,629
any sort of information on this I'm not

887
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,400
really sure what it is well this

888
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,460
particular case it turns out to be a

889
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,010
marker string that piece of ransomware

890
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,270
and the Sinha locker is right again so I

891
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,370
can you know pick that up and now I've

892
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,810
got a way to pivot into a more useful

893
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,189
investigation or on what this you know

894
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,919
this piece of malware actually is that I

895
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:20,950
picked up you know another one in here

896
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,370
they came up in a conversation the

897
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,600
customer a while ago it's like this is a

898
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,800
user agent string or a fragment of a

899
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,659
user agent string that they were seeing

900
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,460
doing some fishy you know miss behavior

901
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,750
on their network so again you know throw

902
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,470
that against an open source collection

903
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,470
see what you're going to get

904
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,679
and turns out a lot of people were

905
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:42,550
observing that I wanted to show you this

906
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,560
one because although you know sort of to

907
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,060
drill into in deep detail probably not

908
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,830
interesting most of what I'm getting

909
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,990
here are black lists from people's

910
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,250
reverse proxies so there a lot of other

911
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,660
people out there they've seen this crawl

912
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,820
are doing nasty things that are decided

913
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,350
to block it so initially immediately

914
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,060
gives me a sense of you know whether

915
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,649
this thing is benign and you know

916
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,210
something if somebody else in my

917
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,940
organization is set up or something that

918
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:06,010
other web webmasters have been blocking

919
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,770
out turns out to be somebody who is

920
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:13,600
collecting email addresses for spamming

921
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:17,200
so so I think I'm almost out of time if

922
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,860
not completely out at five minutes so I

923
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:26,410
wanted to jump back with that into the

924
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:27,639
slides and wrap it up on this I hit most

925
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,200
of the patterns in the demo I think

926
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,260
there's one that I ran out of time so to

927
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,020
speak to it so the first one you know we

928
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,400
thought initially we should optimize for

929
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,980
giving the implementation to an analyst

930
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,330
in a way that gave them the I think

931
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,800
maximize their their control and

932
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,360
transparency and at exactly what the

933
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,649
machine was doing turned out that we

934
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,360
needed to optimize for them being too

935
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,130
busy so that's you know why that the

936
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,169
remote transform server the TDs and

937
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,640
multi gos terminology turned out to be

938
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,290
really important you know other other

939
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,980
tools have similar capabilities and I

940
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:59,080
think you need to lean in that direction

941
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,910
keeping the transforms really atomic

942
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,409
this is one that you know it was it's

943
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,790
counterintuitive because as you're

944
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,010
building the user experience it seems

945
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,860
like you're building a really tedious

946
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:11,380
step-by-step type of capability but then

947
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,000
when you see it in context of transforms

948
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,620
that people have built against other

949
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,750
collections and what you're making

950
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,549
possible by mashing up those those you

951
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,650
know fine grained operations that's when

952
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,850
the magic starts to happen so this is

953
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,470
another one that seemed you know

954
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,819
counterintuitive but you know as we've

955
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:26,319
gotten further into it turned out to be

956
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,720
you think a really good practice

957
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,250
I think transparent results you know

958
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,290
work you know everybody every good

959
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,170
analyst is a skeptic so anything that we

960
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:37,210
can do to put more clarity around where

961
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,010
we got the information why we think it's

962
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,290
relevant why we think it's a match make

963
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,820
it very easy for you to drill back you

964
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,409
know obviously that's that's a virtue so

965
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,730
I mean that's something where we're very

966
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,409
focused on it and there's you know more

967
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,639
to do

968
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:53,920
what and when is the one that I skipped

969
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,819
in the demo path the turns out the one I

970
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,440
was going to show you what's around

971
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,880
shellshock how you know the day that it

972
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,990
broke there were a lot of people you

973
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,880
know tweeting about a free code or IP

974
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,620
address and then within about an hour

975
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,510
you know this there the amount of data

976
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,250
that piled up around that was was so big

977
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,870
there was hard to tell if anybody had

978
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,240
ever talked about that IP before that

979
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,950
day but you know if you can slice the

980
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,779
collection by publication date or by

981
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,660
medium or something like that all of a

982
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:19,090
sudden becomes useful so figured out

983
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,730
that actually you know that that ability

984
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,100
to apply filters to a very narrow spot

985
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,500
in the analysis chain obviously pretty

986
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,790
critical if you're interested in seeing

987
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,530
how we fit it into the multi go

988
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,020
interface you know that I can show you

989
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,670
that afterwards but you know being able

990
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,800
to make those sort of fine grained

991
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,720
filter choices at particulars places in

992
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,130
the in the operations turned out to be

993
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,930
very key otherwise you get the kind of

994
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,400
ketchup bottle problem right where you

995
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,259
shake it and shake and shake it you get

996
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,770
no matches and all of a sudden in your

997
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,290
graph is a hairball and the last piece

998
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,759
in about expecting mystery meat really

999
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,110
sort of saying in our integration take

1000
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,420
the burden away from the analyst to

1001
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,250
understand how we map information you

1002
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,690
don't probably care all that much give

1003
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,550
you a set up place in the information in

1004
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,530
the integration just say I'm looking at

1005
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,840
this I don't know what you call it you

1006
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:06,780
tell me and make it very easy to step

1007
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,740
into probing our collection in that way

1008
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,360
and the last thing I just want to say is

1009
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,330
uh you know we you've gotten to this

1010
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,130
spot by you know a process of lot of

1011
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,180
analysts being being generous with their

1012
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,280
time and saying you know here's what

1013
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,230
we're doing well with multigo you know

1014
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,700
here's what we recommend critiquing our

1015
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,000
integration and saying I like this part

1016
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,649
about it this parts not so much so we've

1017
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,850
been grinding away at it there's a lot

1018
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,640
more than I'm very excited to do with

1019
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,839
this integration but thank you very much

1020
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,400
to those folks in particular I wanted to

1021
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,050
mention Keith Gilbert a malformed buddy

1022
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,630
Labs he's our partner in delivering this

1023
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:40,150
integration and the folks on Andrew and

1024
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,330
roll F ed-up Iturbide you know the the

1025
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,880
folks that build the multi co-product

1026
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,200
been very open and very helpful

1027
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,360
responsive and in helping us move

1028
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,919
through any sort of tech questions or

1029
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,960
use case questions and working with

1030
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,280
their product so we have time for a

1031
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,050
couple questions if there's any from the

1032
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,110
audience yeah and I actually wanted to

1033
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,880
invite mark from domain tools since he's

1034
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,559
also got a great integration with

1035
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,819
off you go if he if you want to address

1036
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,500
any questions to him or if you would

1037
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:13,029
like to help answer them I see something

1038
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:15,250
in the back yeah so I wouldn't ask how

1039
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:17,019
much of your collection is general

1040
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,940
business information and how can you

1041
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:22,118
distinguish between threat information

1042
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,440
associated with say an IP and legitimate

1043
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,960
business information associated with

1044
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,279
that same IP it's so this is you know

1045
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,200
not so much about the integration but

1046
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,880
about our product a lot of it is general

1047
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,098
business information and it can be

1048
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,839
difficult to distinguish it frankly I

1049
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:37,150
think it's also difficult to distinguish

1050
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,369
sometimes between an IP that looks

1051
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,720
benign and nobody has reported it it's

1052
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:42,609
being malicious but you know may be

1053
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,319
important for you versus you know

1054
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:45,848
something that everybody is you know as

1055
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:49,450
observed to be doing suspicious or nasty

1056
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:50,319
things so you know you we're not always

1057
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,210
going to be able to tell the difference

1058
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:53,920
with machinery that's why there need to

1059
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,869
be analysts what we're trying to do is

1060
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,029
create you know aggregates analytic

1061
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,740
metrics around that that are useful for

1062
00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:01,150
you know sorting the sand from the salt

1063
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,529
but at the end of the day you know

1064
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,619
somebody's going to have to look at the

1065
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:08,190
information to make that judgment any

1066
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,190
other questions

1067
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:13,740
okay guys then as far as lunch goes

1068
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,740
thank you Matt thank you

1069
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,530
so for those that are doing the threat

1070
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,359
stream lunch-and-learn that's in cafe

1071
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:35,080
DuPont emerging threats is going to be

1072
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:35,080
in Fox Hall a enjoy yeah thank you yeah
