1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,060
we're super excited to have Richard

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,770
Balak back Richard spoke YearOne if I if

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,929
I remember correctly I think I followed

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,570
him year one he's always a tough act to

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,370
follow so we're super excited to have

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,509
him back again so without further ado

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,689
I'll go ahead and hand it over to

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,690
Richard

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,160
green light well thank you very much

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,050
Rick and Mike - I heard Mike isn't here

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,360
right now but thank you to both of them

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,819
for inviting me into sans in general I

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,379
was thinking about when's the last time

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,269
I spoke at sans and made me think about

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,599
the first time I spoke at sans which was

16
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:58,860
in March of 2000 when I was still

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,869
wearing a uniform and I spoke about what

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,750
eventually became known as backscatter

19
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,250
and you know Wow talk about something

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,460
that no one even cares about these days

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,979
but that's how it goes what I'm going to

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,399
talk to you today talk to you about

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:19,110
today is a story that all of you are

24
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:21,390
part of and it's useful I think to look

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,770
at this story see where it began where

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,350
it's going and what might be some

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,090
implications of it it's it's

28
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,339
underappreciated in some ways but in

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,060
other ways we're right in the thick of

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,920
it I was looking at for example all the

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,899
summits that are coming up and it seems

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,670
like there's one for everything now

33
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:44,100
we've got this threat in Taiwan there's

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,740
a sock one there's there's just this

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,649
proliferation so we're in this tornado

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,699
of cyber and threat intelligence and you

37
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,789
have to say all those things because

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,520
we're in DC right or Annie or DC anyways

39
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:58,979
but what I want to do is bring to you

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,310
perspective that steps out of that for a

41
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,990
moment and takes a look at it and then

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:12,470
gets right back into it and talks about

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:14,519
where it might be going right right so

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,530
here we go oops all right so I'm going

45
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,780
to give you the bottom line up front so

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,269
that if you only want to remember one

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,640
thing here it is so we're in the middle

48
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:26,630
of a revolution in private sector

49
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,850
intelligence I'm not going to talk about

50
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,959
capabilities of the fort or what can be

51
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,480
done in the government side I'm talking

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,370
about the private sector where I imagine

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,798
many of you are from and that's where I

54
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,019
am right now at fireEye and I'm not an

55
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,430
Intel person at fireEye I don't do that

56
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,160
work we'll have one of our Intel people

57
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,389
come up she's awesome I have to leave

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,709
right after her talk but I made sure I

59
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,190
could see hers

60
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,250
no disrespecting the other speak

61
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,829
but definitely wanted to see that this

62
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,930
revolution in Intel is being driven by

63
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,920
five factors first is imagery and

64
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,930
initially the imagery that caught my

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,010
attention was commercial satellite

66
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,450
imagery and I'm going to show you some

67
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,250
wonderful examples that what can be done

68
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,739
with it but increasingly now we're

69
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,150
seeing imagery taken by smartphones as

70
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,820
playing a key role I'm gonna give you

71
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,440
some examples of that and beyond even

72
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,480
that now we have imagery from drone so

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,390
when you put these three together it's

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,700
pretty amazing

75
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:24,220
second one is experts and this is where

76
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,429
you come in we have people who got their

77
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,650
start in this field many times in the

78
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,920
government or in the military which is

79
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,320
how I did it but what's even cooler now

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,630
is that those people are in the private

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,940
sector and they're training new people

82
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,519
who are coming into completely private

83
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,230
sector Intel shops who have potentially

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,220
no training whatsoever and they're

85
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,440
teaching them how to be real

86
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,730
intelligence analysts and those new

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,350
people don't have any military or

88
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,399
government training so we're starting

89
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,730
this whole new industry out of

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,620
completely within the private sector let

91
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,660
me jump ahead to jobs the fact that

92
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,730
there are jobs to be had is what is

93
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,070
really exciting to me as well you don't

94
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,570
have to go work for one of the 17

95
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,030
intelligence agencies if you want to be

96
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,739
an Intel person you could go to school

97
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,380
get a degree in either you know

98
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,450
technical field or a social field an

99
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,950
area expert and you could go work for an

100
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,108
intelligence company you don't have to

101
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,919
go work for the government this is a big

102
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:25,950
problem for government by the way

103
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:30,099
collaboration what you're seeing now is

104
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,969
places and interactions between people

105
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,830
of different skill sets and that's being

106
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,650
facilitated by software in the form of

107
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,880
cloud forums and social media and I'm

108
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,099
going to give you some examples of that

109
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,350
and what that really does is it gives

110
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,840
the chance for some people who are still

111
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,180
inside the formal Intel community to

112
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,909
mentor unofficially people on the

113
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,490
outside and in some cases to confirm or

114
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,030
deny while hiding behind a pseudonym or

115
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,950
a handle which can be very very useful

116
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,479
so the bottom line about this is there

117
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,990
are definite benefits to this I'm going

118
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,849
to show you

119
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,970
but there are also some costs and we

120
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,460
don't know how to handle it yet so let's

121
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,960
start the story from not necessarily the

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,460
beginning but I'm going to show you my

123
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,440
beginning because it will set up a

124
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,210
contrast between where we've come from

125
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,210
and where we are where we're going so

126
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,350
March let's see I graduated from my

127
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,300
master's program in the June of 96 and I

128
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,420
went to Intel school at lovely San

129
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:36,730
Angelo Texas do I have any Texans here

130
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:40,090
love Texas right grow Texas I graduated

131
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:43,480
with as a 14 and if anyone knows what

132
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,760
that is Air Force Intel I learned things

133
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,860
like how to interpret imagery I learned

134
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,440
how to handle classified information I

135
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,900
learned not to put it on a server that I

136
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,060
deployed myself I learned that

137
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,090
information is classified even though it

138
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,590
bears no markings I learned not to take

139
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,090
markings off of classified information

140
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,359
and transmit it as if it were

141
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,979
unclassified all sorts of useful skills

142
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,700
that would have benefited someone else

143
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,890
apparently but this was how you became

144
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,020
an Intel person back then is you went to

145
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,000
school and you this school was nine

146
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,950
months it was the basically the second

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,050
longest or the longest school in the

148
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:25,810
airforce I think only pilot training was

149
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:27,220
longer and after that I was well I want

150
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,460
to say I was sent but I had the choice

151
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,580
of jobs and I went to San Antonio Texas

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,260
where I went to an intelligence agency

153
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,900
the commander there was a guy you might

154
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:43,000
have heard of Mike Hayden so I worked

155
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:45,310
for him in the fall of 97 you might

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,320
remember we were involved in all sorts

157
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,750
of conflicts in the former Yugoslavia

158
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,120
and there was a need to send Intel

159
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,950
analysts over to this place called Jack

160
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,530
Molesworth joining the analysis center

161
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,510
Molesworth in the UK to the targeting

162
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,039
shop so that we would pick targets and

163
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:05,650
then strike them and the preparation I

164
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,080
got for this job was this is just a four

165
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,310
month temporary duty tty the preparation

166
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,840
I got for this job was that book that

167
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,250
you see right there that's the cover on

168
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,690
the far left and I still have it I

169
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,950
forgot to bring it in I'd love to use

170
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,810
props but I

171
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,370
forgot it Rick told me he was actually

172
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,130
downrange when he was in the army he

173
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,050
still has this copy of the same book so

174
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,480
in this book you can see a picture it

175
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,540
lived inside you have maps you have

176
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,850
images of weaponry that's involved a

177
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,280
little bit of the conflict between the

178
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,230
different sides and so forth this was

179
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,530
this book was published in February of

180
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,500
97 I got my copy and I guess my one over

181
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,880
there in September of 97 this was state

182
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,130
of the art the fact that you could get a

183
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,930
handbook and you could read something

184
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,940
about this conflict before going over

185
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,220
there prior to that the only knowledge I

186
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,790
had a conflict was what I could read in

187
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,080
the newspaper I in May of 97 I started

188
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,670
subscribing to the economist so I was

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,010
able to read some decent open source

190
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:04,170
about what was happening but that was it

191
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,170
there's no Wikipedia there was no

192
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,350
Stratfor there was no private Intel

193
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,820
there was nothing out there to read but

194
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:14,020
so this is what I had and that's what I

195
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:18,520
worked with one of the operations we did

196
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,979
there was counter propaganda against

197
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,320
what one of the factions was was doing

198
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,110
they were sending out all sorts of vile

199
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,450
messages out over the airwaves inciting

200
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:32,830
people to hatred and kill others and so

201
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:34,929
forth so our commander put a request out

202
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,850
and said we want to take down the

203
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:39,789
Serbian communications network how can

204
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:42,430
we do that so my shop took a look at it

205
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,699
and we we had our classified imagery on

206
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,650
our classified systems incidentally

207
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,870
which I was building a website on top of

208
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,949
classified website that had targeting

209
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,450
folders and this was state-of-the-art

210
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,860
you know we weren't using pieces of

211
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,280
paper and we were going to use a website

212
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,470
with HTML so the fact that I could code

213
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,120
in HTML was a huge deal back then which

214
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,890
basically meant I knew how to use an a

215
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,310
href tag and TR and Li and a couple of

216
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:12,340
other tags like that so the product of

217
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,550
of our work there was not rather than

218
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,630
bombing these stations and putting them

219
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,280
out of commission s for the the

220
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,470
stabilization force rolled tanks up to

221
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,010
each one of these six targets that we

222
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,810
identified walked inside and told the

223
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,850
Serbians hey stop broadcasting

224
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,949
and they said okay fine so that was a

225
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,870
counter information warfare operation

226
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,490
that was handled with physical forces

227
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,110
and there's a paper that's there and I

228
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,400
put references throughout this whole

229
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,840
thing because I know you're in thrall

230
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,260
and you want to look up every reference

231
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,089
and follow everything right so that was

232
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,180
an example when in that picture there is

233
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:51,520
from I think it's from Stars and Stripes

234
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,589
that the next day there was a picture of

235
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,819
one of the towers that was taken down

236
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,760
and we looked at and we're like oh that

237
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,410
dude that's Dugan Eva Hill in unit six

238
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,920
one nine and all that stuff we were

239
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,110
pretty excited okay so that's where we

240
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,910
were back then last fall

241
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,950
I'm sort of keeping track of

242
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,029
geopolitical events because it's what I

243
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,790
like to do I don't really

244
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,310
cyber these days and I see this

245
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,800
incredible story about the Russian

246
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:21,459
buildup in Syria and it's firsthand

247
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,420
reporting by a guy in Turkey but I

248
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,400
didn't know he was in Turkey at the

249
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,349
moment but this guy who was watching

250
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,939
naval vessels passed through the

251
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,230
Bosphorus and he's taking pictures and

252
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,850
he's putting him on the internet in a

253
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,260
blog post and I looked at this and I

254
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,660
said this is amazing and he's not just

255
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,939
taking pictures like OMA tourists he

256
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,920
goes through any catalogs them all what

257
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,839
what vessel it was what markings when

258
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,569
they passed through whether they were

259
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,790
going north or south and he has this

260
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,260
data going back for years and I read his

261
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,760
bio and he says oh this is the thing I

262
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,439
do for fun and his other people to do

263
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,870
the same thing and I thought this is

264
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,070
amazing this guy I mean 20 years ago he

265
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,020
would have been paying this guy to do

266
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:02,770
this work and he's doing it for free on

267
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,270
a blog now when I first looked at this I

268
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,699
said bosphorous did he misspelled that

269
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,140
because I thought Bosporus just with a P

270
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,630
so of course what do I do

271
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,000
I google it and I get a map and I look

272
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,189
okay well yeah I knew he was at a body

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,240
of water let me zoom out and i zoom out

274
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,060
and it's where I thought it was it's

275
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,920
just it's the strait that passes into

276
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,859
the Mediterranean eventually and the

277
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:28,120
ships would go from up in Russia and

278
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:31,720
down through and over Syria so it struck

279
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,150
me I said wow this is just a window into

280
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,410
this world that's out there this

281
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,970
revolution and private sector

282
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,380
intelligence is happening right now and

283
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,820
there are people like this guy who's

284
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,110
taking these photos he probably doesn't

285
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,320
even know he's part of it he's just

286
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,760
taking photos do you put him on

287
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,130
so I thought for a second and I said you

288
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,120
know I wonder if there's imagery of that

289
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,680
Hill in the former Yugoslavia and what

290
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,680
does it look like how far back does it

291
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,649
go what what changes have occurred and I

292
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,170
was able to use Google Earth again if we

293
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,520
had had Google Earth 10 20 years ago Oh

294
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,640
unbelievable

295
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,649
so you know we have to task satellites

296
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,000
back then we had to put in a request and

297
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,250
maybe two months later you've got an

298
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,860
image and it's blurry and you get it

299
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,480
oriented no I click on a link and boom

300
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,330
I'm looking at four years worth of

301
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,760
imagery here and so you can see the

302
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:25,990
progression of September of oh seven

303
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,730
April 11 2011 79 2012 and you can do

304
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,010
some comparison analysis it looks like

305
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,430
they've they've put another tower up

306
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,980
there's some activity there this is this

307
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,800
is amazing when I had to get imagery

308
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,470
before I had to sort of beg borrow and

309
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,170
steal anybody I could talk to to task a

310
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,140
satellite to get a photo and here if

311
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,599
this isn't sufficient I just pay it I

312
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,850
pay money and I get the picture taken

313
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,740
and there's even an app for that

314
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,480
one of these one of these satellite

315
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,220
providers has an app that you can do on

316
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,640
your phone so you can't ask a satellite

317
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:06,070
from your phone to take a picture this

318
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,990
is amazing so when I when I did that for

319
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,250
blocker there it reminded me of

320
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,660
something else that was in the news

321
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:17,290
recently and this is the Chinese buildup

322
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,870
of so-called Islands which are more or

323
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,540
less just like rocks in the ocean but

324
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,589
they're turning them into islands and

325
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,380
they're turning them into islands to

326
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:29,649
project their maritime claims forward

327
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,620
into the South and East China Seas so

328
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:35,290
this is another example of using open

329
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,790
sector or open source imagery that you

330
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,490
can buy from digital globe or elsewhere

331
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:43,110
and doing timeline analysis and seeing

332
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:46,570
visually the buildup of these forces and

333
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,760
this speaks a thousand times more than

334
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,709
reading some Intel report or a newspaper

335
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,410
story when you put a picture like this

336
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,520
in front of a decision-maker that grabs

337
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,990
their attention because they can look

338
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,270
and they say huh that

339
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,089
to be pretty and green and natural and

340
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:06,060
now there's a runway and there are

341
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:06,060
putting triple-a guns and other things

342
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,390
so let's move into another area of what

343
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:16,739
you can do this analysis or what you can

344
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:19,600
do with this analysis you can do

345
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:23,080
economic analysis using this open source

346
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,610
data here's an example from the 38north

347
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,580
project and they're one of my poster

348
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,730
children for the revolution in private

349
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,100
sector Intel they do things with with

350
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,860
imagery that I didn't think you

351
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,350
necessarily could or I hadn't heard of

352
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,870
people in the private sector doing it so

353
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:45,700
what they're looking at here is a

354
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,360
section of North Korea where it connects

355
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,270
to China

356
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,580
and they're trying to use changes in the

357
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,810
terrain there to show whether or not

358
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,589
there is an increase in economic

359
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,939
activity so the two photographs on the

360
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,190
left are a pair and the two photographs

361
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,100
on the right or a pair on the left the

362
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,140
top left photo you see essentially

363
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,810
nothing it's like a field dirt mud

364
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,689
whatever and then the photograph below

365
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:13,300
it shows within what's the time

366
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,360
difference they're just a few months in

367
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:20,020
2015 a whole bunch of activity

368
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,700
warehouses built up here etc this is an

369
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,760
indicator that there is academic or

370
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:28,209
economic activity going on on the right

371
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,240
you see something similar the same guys

372
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:33,790
from 38 north did some really cool

373
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,550
analysis showing how there have been

374
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,319
factories being built in North Korea but

375
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,959
they're getting their power from China

376
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,370
so they're looking at they're looking at

377
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,229
this commercial imagery and they see a

378
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,820
factory and then they see a little dent

379
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,870
in the woods and they just start

380
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,579
following it and you can just imagine

381
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,260
they're just sort of scrolling their

382
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:51,430
mouse scrolling their mouse scrolling

383
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,500
their mouse and they're following the

384
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,329
line and then they say oh this is now

385
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,829
over the border and they follow it

386
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,829
follow it follow it follow it follow it

387
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:01,120
and they realize it's some Chinese

388
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:03,640
businessman who doesn't trust the North

389
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,500
Korean power grid so he cut a swath

390
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,540
through the forest to ran his own cable

391
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,610
essentially to keep electricity flowing

392
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,579
to his power play

393
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,200
sorry his factory in North Korea where

394
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:17,579
he can get cheap or potentially slave

395
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,370
labor but have reliable Chinese power

396
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:22,420
and you can use that to determine what's

397
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,490
the relationship between the two

398
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,459
countries what could potentially be

399
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:33,220
changing and so forth that's all just

400
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:35,529
from imagery now this is where we'll get

401
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,730
out of the economic we'll get but I

402
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,230
think's a little bit the cooler stuff

403
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,700
and this is where you talk about open

404
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:44,110
source military analysis so it seems

405
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,320
like every once in a while somebody

406
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,420
finds some cool new military gear in

407
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,700
commercial imagery and this is another

408
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,069
example from 38 north where they found a

409
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:57,160
new North Korean submarine where the

410
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,200
submarine is and they can figure out

411
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,319
things like how long the submarine is

412
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,260
how big it is if there are torpedo tubes

413
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,490
when they see a canopy over part of it

414
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,809
they assume that it's something they're

415
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,699
trying to hide and what they can make

416
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,129
some assumptions about what what's worth

417
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,679
hiding even though you can't see it okay

418
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,179
maybe there are other missile tubes back

419
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,429
there different diameters or different

420
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,809
kind of missile and so forth and then

421
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:21,459
they can take that information and

422
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,689
render a diagram and which is what they

423
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:24,459
did in the lower left-hand corner this

424
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:30,100
is what we think this submarine looks

425
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:33,490
like let's switch over to Syria for a

426
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,949
moment if you haven't seen the Institute

427
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,230
for the Study of wars work their stuff

428
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,780
is just top-notch in fact most maps you

429
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:44,200
see on CNN and newspapers they're all

430
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,149
ultimately derived from isw in fact the

431
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,970
ISW folks are often briefing the

432
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,390
Pentagon about what's happening in Syria

433
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,740
because their their stuff is so good so

434
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,679
here you have a completely open source

435
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,770
group located just a few miles away up

436
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,080
in DC who is tracking what's happening

437
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,179
in Syria and it doesn't come through

438
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,699
here but one of the really interesting

439
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,650
projects there they're doing is they go

440
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,530
through social media like nobody's

441
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,450
business they follow all of these

442
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:16,178
jihadis and such on Twitter and YouTube

443
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,040
and they have a language expert so they

444
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,510
understand Arabic and these out you know

445
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,320
other languages because it's not just a

446
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:25,420
an Arabic phenomenon and there

447
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,649
tracking the changes in these groups and

448
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,270
figure out what they're gonna hit and

449
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,770
they're debunking some of what they say

450
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,690
in terms of they claimed responsibility

451
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:42,040
for target but they didn't really hit it

452
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:45,970
and so forth now the the lady who runs

453
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,940
is w is married to an analyst at AEI and

454
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,460
so AEI has been taking a look at what's

455
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,900
going on in Syria as well and this is

456
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,270
another example of one of those just

457
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,080
priceless photos that says a lot this is

458
00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:04,030
a picture of a of an airport runway in

459
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,590
Syria and it shows the the plane that's

460
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,520
in the middle there that's a blow-up of

461
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,879
the one to the right

462
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,620
that's an su-34 full back it's a ground

463
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,060
attack aircraft because it's not

464
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,389
exclusively ground attack but it that's

465
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,200
the role most often it's it's used for

466
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:22,360
this is significant because first of all

467
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,120
this level of imagery that you can

468
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:29,560
identify the aircraft is awesome in the

469
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,469
open source world secondly there are

470
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,320
only 93 of these in the world it's a

471
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,730
replacement for the su-24 fencer which

472
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,620
is a 1960s era ground attack airplane

473
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,580
where there is thousands of them so if

474
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,780
the Russians are sending oh in this this

475
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,449
su-34 was only put into production in

476
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,860
2014 so the fact that they're sending

477
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,660
their frontline ground attack fighter

478
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,550
tells you they're not fooling around

479
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,700
they're not sending their garbage planes

480
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,220
to this they're sending their best stuff

481
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,050
you also see above that in il-76 candid

482
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,790
which is their strategic airlift which

483
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,379
means they could pull in tanks they

484
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,360
could pull in armored personnel carriers

485
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,060
they could just bring in troops or

486
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,490
supplies as well but catching this stuff

487
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,750
and then measuring it over time gives

488
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,430
you an idea of what's happening in in

489
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,880
Syria potentially with the Russian

490
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,880
involvement

491
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,120
let's put a let's take another little

492
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,610
little deviation from just sort of

493
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,610
tracking what's happening you probably

494
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,290
have seen differing reports about

495
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,899
whether or not the Russians are really

496
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:35,970
fighting Isis in Syria they claim that

497
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,830
they are other people are claiming that

498
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,920
they're not you know the US government's

499
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,899
claim that they're not at least mostly

500
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,460
that they're not so what's the truth

501
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:49,170
so there's a open source Intel analyst

502
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,040
who goes by the handle Belling cat his

503
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:56,400
real name is Eliot Higgins and he

504
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,110
decided to crowdsource the problem so

505
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,940
this is a combination of all the things

506
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,469
that we just talked about we have the

507
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:07,170
imagery we have the analysts we have

508
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,760
software which I'll show in a second all

509
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,350
coming together to say whether or not

510
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,300
this is really happening

511
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:16,500
are the who are the Russians bombing in

512
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:19,139
Syria and by the way that's Russian

513
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,780
footage that was released via RT there

514
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,580
you know Russian television it's got

515
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:28,170
that Gulf War feel to it right remember

516
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:30,570
how all that looked back in 91 so the

517
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:33,810
the Belling can analysis used this this

518
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,580
open platform called silk where you can

519
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,110
just upload your data to it and then

520
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,030
people can use it to analyze you guys

521
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,669
probably know I've never used it so you

522
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:44,160
guys probably know what it is but as a

523
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,230
result of their analysis they found out

524
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,880
that about 45 percent of the Russian

525
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,390
government claims to be hitting Isis are

526
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,230
true forty percent are false

527
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:57,720
and 15 percent is unknown so at best

528
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,030
the Russians are you know it's a net

529
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,090
mixed result whether or not they're

530
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,410
really hitting Isis targets so I think

531
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,500
this is pretty powerful that you could

532
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,780
have a completely third party

533
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,970
influencing potentially US government

534
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,420
you know other government policies based

535
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,610
on their open analysis of imagery and

536
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,070
other information now this took a lot of

537
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,870
work and is you might be expecting

538
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,610
there's even a possibility that you

539
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,500
could screw this up and I'll get to that

540
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,070
at the end as a risk of this type of

541
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,070
analysis

542
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,370
pivot a little bit talked about hitting

543
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,500
Isis if you haven't seen this report

544
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,290
this is pretty amazing this is the

545
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,810
George Washington University's program

546
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,960
on terrorism they put out this report

547
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,280
called Isis in America this to me is the

548
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,770
story that the current administration

549
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,100
doesn't want to tell because they want

550
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,260
to project we're winning JV squad you

551
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,929
know Obama's coasting out of here on a

552
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,350
high well meanwhile we got this big

553
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,660
problem and this report spells it all

554
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,639
out and in the description of it they

555
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,250
talked about going through more than

556
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,660
7,000 pages of legal documents they

557
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,170
interviewed people that interviewed

558
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,480
families of radicalized young people

559
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,430
this is this isn't just you know I sat

560
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,050
back I read some newspaper articles I

561
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,030
put some glossy marketing together and I

562
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:25,330
sent it out they did a ton of work on

563
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,090
this so very very impressive this just

564
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,580
gives you sort of a hint of it they do

565
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:33,310
profiles of various radicalized

566
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,439
individuals they show a bunch of social

567
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,659
media excerpts that give you a real

568
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,420
flavor of what's happening out there and

569
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:43,030
I wouldn't be surprised if this is

570
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,950
better or at least on par with anything

571
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,889
that's being circulated in in the close

572
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,910
community the good thing about this is

573
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,290
and we'll see this with some of the

574
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,390
other reports later that I mentioned

575
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:56,980
there something that the public can talk

576
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:59,350
about and not be afraid of busting a

577
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,900
security clearance or being at risk from

578
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,399
being prosecuted because the you know

579
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,410
the Obama administration is the number

580
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,080
one they've gone after more leakers than

581
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,770
anyone else in history which is a little

582
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,210
scary if you're in this field I think

583
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,340
now unfortunately I'll turn briefly to

584
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,990
the the Paris attack and what struck me

585
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,840
about this besides the fact that it was

586
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,850
just a horrible tragedy was that almost

587
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,429
within minutes people were trying to

588
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:27,100
figure out what happened and I want to

589
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,590
say within hours someone had produced

590
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,740
this graph of different elements of the

591
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:35,860
attack identities and so forth and put

592
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,170
it on the internet now I found this

593
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:42,459
through Twitter and then I went to this

594
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:44,619
website but can I trust this guy I mean

595
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,929
who is this guy I didn't say who it is I

596
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,809
just I linked to the critical threats

597
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:51,159
page where I first saw it this starts

598
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,600
you know it starts to make me wonder you

599
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,869
know what are your sources can I trust

600
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,490
you

601
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:56,709
what's your record what's your

602
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,059
reputation you just can't go in and say

603
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,980
oh this is real because it looks pretty

604
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,240
and it's nicely laid out I mean this

605
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,830
certain amount of that if it's just

606
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,169
drawn on a napkin maybe I'm not gonna

607
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,939
pay as much attention but if it looks

608
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,289
like a lot of work went into it that

609
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,240
might have a little bit more legitimacy

610
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,590
but as I mentioned it's sort of hints

611
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,090
that these questions you need to ask

612
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:18,158
which we'll get to in a moment let me

613
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:21,279
pull in the collaboration aspect a

614
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,929
little bit there are if you're not into

615
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,759
this world you know I don't spend a

616
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:27,190
whole lot of time here I just dip in and

617
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,070
out but the level of collaboration that

618
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,649
goes on in the open source military

619
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,139
analysis field is just amazing

620
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:37,479
I was looking at laser and railgun

621
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:39,729
development in China because you know

622
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,970
I'm so exciting to talk about those

623
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,820
sorts of things and the level of detail

624
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,460
that people talk about is just

625
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:51,879
remarkable it tells me these are people

626
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,769
that work in this field they probably

627
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:55,269
work for the manufacturers or they work

628
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,649
for the consumption side know they're on

629
00:25:55,269 --> 00:26:00,369
these Navy ships with it with the rail

630
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:02,049
guns and they can talk you know they

631
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:03,639
don't just talk about the the Chinese

632
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:05,710
capability they say well that looks like

633
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:07,899
a navy such-and-such it has this range

634
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,309
and so forth and the way that they can

635
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,008
get away with it is they don't put their

636
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,259
real names so they use a pseudonym so

637
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:16,269
they can hide and not reveal that yeah I

638
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:18,700
work at Northrop or Lockheed or wherever

639
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:20,049
and that they could still contribute to

640
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,029
this dialogue so I'm sure this is a

641
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:25,559
field day for the other side but for our

642
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:28,690
community I think it's valuable as well

643
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:31,149
okay I got to say the a-word this is a

644
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,700
cyber threat Intel conference got to

645
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:35,860
talk about attribution I'm tired of

646
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,049
hearing about how hard attribution is oh

647
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,059
it's so hard I work in cyber ak3

648
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,240
attribution try getting out into the

649
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:45,158
physical world for a minute all right

650
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,480
little green men in fact I have a real

651
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,029
little green man look how little that

652
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,899
guy is compared to the reporter this is

653
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:53,320
from March of 2014 I think is that tweet

654
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:55,840
of mine

655
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,230
yeah March 1st of 2014 i watch this news

656
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,899
report

657
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,970
CNN and this reporter speaks Russian

658
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,490
this is actually a theme you'll see

659
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,700
language expertise subject-matter

660
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,230
expertise really matters in this field

661
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,650
she's talking to this soldier who's in

662
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,400
who's in Crimea and she just asked him

663
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,690
where are you from

664
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,640
and he doesn't know D better look at him

665
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:19,570
he's probably like 17 years old he says

666
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,010
I'm he says I'm from Russia oh well they

667
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,439
didn't expect that right

668
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:25,390
I hope this kids okay but he basically

669
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,500
you know he just outed himself he

670
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,110
doesn't have any of his flame we took

671
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:33,340
all his patches he's he's a little green

672
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:35,979
man he's not he's not identifying the

673
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,290
via the signals you would use in a

674
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,690
traditional military operation but when

675
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:46,270
asked he doesn't know yeah I was sent

676
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:48,040
here I'm from Russia so this is where I

677
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,190
get to one of my two reports that I

678
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,500
brought with me you can't have them but

679
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,710
that you I do recommend strongly reading

680
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,660
them this is the Atlantic Council's

681
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,490
report called hiding in plain sight and

682
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,880
this is one of the two reports it really

683
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,950
motivated me to do this talk this is an

684
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,200
incredible open source of analysis

685
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,419
basically proving that the Russians

686
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,450
invaded Ukraine no what no two ways

687
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:14,860
about it and the level of detail and the

688
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,140
techniques they use I've never seen

689
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,580
anywhere else except for in the closed

690
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,890
world and I'll try to give you some

691
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,980
examples of that they do things like

692
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:28,360
tracking individual vehicle movements

693
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:30,790
from Russia to Ukraine how the soldiers

694
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,770
take photos and put them on Facebook or

695
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,600
the Russian equivalent of Facebook or

696
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,700
the Russian equivalent of Twitter or

697
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,379
wherever so if you know where to go and

698
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,510
you can speak Russian and you can see

699
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,860
pictures and you can recognize serial

700
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,870
numbers and do things like that

701
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,760
you can track these things so guess what

702
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,340
that's what these guys did and this is

703
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,440
where the attribution piece comes in

704
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,240
when you are putting your life on the

705
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,179
Internet

706
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,900
attribution becomes easier give you some

707
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:01,240
examples two unfortunate examples these

708
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,140
two there's a young man in the top left

709
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,730
and then there's a young man on the

710
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,190
right actually he's the guy in the left

711
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,470
is also in the right hand side picture

712
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,659
they didn't survive their encounters in

713
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,239
Ukraine these are Russian soldiers

714
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:14,529
who deployed to Ukraine despite beings

715
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,179
you know the Russian government denying

716
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:19,960
that this happened they went to Ukraine

717
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:22,179
they died in combat and you know their

718
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,039
families grieve they're lost now and the

719
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:26,619
report goes through and talks about

720
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,599
reading their social media posts where

721
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:32,470
they are what they were doing what unit

722
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:34,840
they were from the aftermath reporting

723
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,489
you know the basically once you have

724
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,689
that little hint of something and this

725
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:39,190
is where you don't remember this from

726
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,539
the cyber world once you have that

727
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,399
little hint of something that's thread

728
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:45,158
to pull you can find tons of stuff

729
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,859
that's kind of the way I like to think

730
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:51,009
about it is you know OPSEC is this wall

731
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:52,960
but it has like Niagara Falls on the

732
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:54,759
other side and as long as you get one

733
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,029
little crack the whole thing is just

734
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,470
gonna just explode so that's what

735
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,149
happens here you get this little insight

736
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,830
and then you suddenly pull in all these

737
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:04,478
threads you pull in this torrent and

738
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,849
you've got this whole guy's life story

739
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:08,889
and it's enabled by those factors I

740
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:10,599
showed earlier the most important one in

741
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:12,189
this case is these soldiers are

742
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:15,549
documenting what's happening to them as

743
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,440
it's happening it's not like in a civil

744
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:21,190
war where you basically have letters

745
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,899
from from home you know that I can read

746
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:27,309
years later this is all happening right

747
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:30,359
now one other part of this report that

748
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:33,460
just totally blew my mind away the

749
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,710
analysts figured out where the shells

750
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,960
were coming from by analyzing the burn

751
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,359
marks in the ground the direction that

752
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,099
they were being fired from estimating

753
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:44,109
the type of weapon that would cause such

754
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,580
a mark pulling the range back and

755
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:49,090
figuring out that the firing positions

756
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,978
were inside Russia we used that's an

757
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,449
army thing right who learned how to do

758
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,979
that it's probably something army person

759
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,929
who's now in the private sector working

760
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:59,049
in Atlantic Council whatever just just

761
00:30:55,929 --> 00:31:00,609
amazing ok I talked about how to do that

762
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:02,440
finally there's not just little green

763
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,899
men those little blue men they're

764
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,669
Chinese and they're in so-called Coast

765
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:08,758
Guard vehicles but guess what they're

766
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:11,649
not Coast Guard vehicles they're

767
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,179
essentially paramilitary vehicles who

768
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:16,738
are out there enforcing territorial

769
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:18,600
claims so I want to mention that as well

770
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:21,389
ok

771
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,519
yeah attribution can be hard in the

772
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:24,928
physical world as well on the Left we

773
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,149
have a criminal who is trying to break

774
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:28,559
into the same drugstore for the third

775
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:30,840
time and they still don't know who this

776
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,549
guy is they eventually will find him in

777
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,379
the prosecutor so don't tell me

778
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:35,879
attribution is so difficult physical

779
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,710
side world does it all the time

780
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,230
on the right hand side we have

781
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,450
conflicting stories about where the

782
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,940
Russian shoot down occurred the Russians

783
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,460
say oh no we were that red line we were

784
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,840
swung way away from Turkey and then we

785
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,190
went towards Turkey then all of a sudden

786
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,168
we realized we needed to go south and

787
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,419
they went south which I don't think

788
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:55,769
necessarily happened the Turk line is

789
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,500
the purple one which shows that they be

790
00:31:55,769 --> 00:32:00,240
Russians cut across that little

791
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,620
peninsula of land at the bottom but I

792
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,960
don't necessarily think that warranted a

793
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,158
shoot down so figuring out what happened

794
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,730
is difficult in the physical world as

795
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,529
well okay I have a few minutes left let

796
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,299
me pull in to cyber side I'm going to

797
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,309
take you through a quick tour of what I

798
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,389
consider to be the highlights now of the

799
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,120
revolution of private sector

800
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:21,059
intelligence from the computer security

801
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,789
side I think it started in in March of

802
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:27,840
2009 with a ghost net report this was

803
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:29,519
the guys up in Toronto who are now part

804
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,379
of citizen lab and doing all that work

805
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,259
they continue to do wonderful work this

806
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:35,820
was the first real expose of Chinese

807
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:38,820
activity against the Dalai Lama and

808
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,620
other dissident groups so just just over

809
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,330
seven years ago so this is where you

810
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,658
know we're inside this this revolution

811
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:49,168
right now fast forward a little bit more

812
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:52,620
than two years we have the shady rat

813
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:56,009
report Dimitri his guy's not a very

814
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,830
large report but this definitely put the

815
00:32:56,009 --> 00:33:02,490
attention once again back on the on the

816
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:05,100
Chinese side at least fast forward about

817
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,779
two more years it's funny how these big

818
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,850
milestones in my opinion come out about

819
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:11,850
every two years we have the Mandy report

820
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:15,480
so that's gonna be three years old in

821
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:17,699
about two weeks and the thing I think

822
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,009
that struck people about this report was

823
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,769
there was a building and once there's a

824
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:25,169
building a reporter can visit it and the

825
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:27,600
reporter can try to run into his taxi

826
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,639
and tell the driver go go go and try to

827
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,620
speed away from the Chinese soldiers who

828
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,459
are chasing them and the taxi driver

829
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,989
wusses

830
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,520
and stops and the guy gets pulled out of

831
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:39,990
the taxi and it's all caught on camera

832
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:42,450
that's what's great about that report go

833
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:47,060
ahead two more years and this is where

834
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:48,270
you need to look up back there mr. rich

835
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,860
yes

836
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,370
I'm gonna give you some really good

837
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,209
props this report how many people have

838
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,300
read camera-shy

839
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,190
oh okay everybody's hand needs to go up

840
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,659
you need to read camera-shy I'm gonna

841
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,860
talk about this one because I love this

842
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:07,500
report so much this to me is one of the

843
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,770
best reports and to me this is like the

844
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,510
the high point right now of this

845
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,550
integration of private sector Intel

846
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,680
that's occurring right now I think of it

847
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,180
so highly I had a color copy made and

848
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,250
bound and I carry it with me I love it

849
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,469
okay so what is so great about this

850
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,889
report well if you don't know about this

851
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:28,649
report came out last fall and basically

852
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,029
it was a combination of DGI and threat

853
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,970
connect and a little help from passive

854
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,430
total they completely doxxed this

855
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:38,189
Chinese PLA guy that's his the easiest

856
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:40,469
way to put it they revealed what this

857
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,679
unit seven eight oh two O is doing and

858
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:44,639
what they were able to pull together

859
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:49,520
exemplifies a lot of the points that

860
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:52,469
I've made just now they eventually

861
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,810
because of some technical analysis were

862
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:56,549
able to pull the thread and identify an

863
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:59,610
individual now this had been done before

864
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,870
right we with our AP to one report we

865
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,810
had different persona that we talked

866
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,790
about but but this report really digs

867
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,730
into this one guy and this is basically

868
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:10,650
a laundry list of what not to do if

869
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,290
you're trying to hide your identity when

870
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,660
you're doing PLA computer operations so

871
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,580
this guy I mean his whole life is on the

872
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,009
internet you see him there with his pet

873
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:22,200
he puts pictures of his car cuz he's so

874
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,030
proud of it with his license plate so

875
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,319
you know where he lives because license

876
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,780
plates are just like they are in the

877
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,790
States you can identify that he talks

878
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,770
about his bike like apparently he's an

879
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:37,080
avid cyclist he talks about trying to

880
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:38,970
sell his bicycles this is where you guys

881
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,490
really blew me away this is reminiscent

882
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,810
of the hiding in plain sight report so I

883
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,910
mentioned in the hiding in plain sight

884
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,960
report that they were able to use burn

885
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,848
marks and

886
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,530
camera angles to figure out where the

887
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:52,770
shells that come from well what these

888
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:56,280
guys did in camera-shy is they took a

889
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:58,230
look at photos that mr. Gore had posted

890
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,890
and figured out where would you have to

891
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:03,990
be to take that photo and I realized he

892
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,029
would have to be in the technical

893
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,609
reconnaissance Bureau headquarters of

894
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,760
unit 7 802 Oh in order to get these

895
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:13,859
different angles which I was just

896
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,240
thoroughly impressed you know here's a

897
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:20,009
picture from the inside come on I mean

898
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,899
you just you place this guy at his

899
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:25,579
building that's even better than just

900
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,579
saying here's the building in my opinion

901
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:32,009
now I have to put a little shout-out for

902
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:33,540
kaspersky I like kaspersky but they sort

903
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,910
of like jump the shark with this this to

904
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,099
me this is their apt tracker this is

905
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,660
also what looks like the Gris the

906
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:43,650
craziest game of Battleship I've ever

907
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:45,359
seen I went there just to see all the

908
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,069
different groups they were tracking but

909
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,980
I had to take a screenshot this is the

910
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,329
new like pew pew Norse map to me which I

911
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,790
have to be careful of fireEye has one

912
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:58,410
obviously but I like this one from the

913
00:36:53,790 --> 00:37:00,150
kaspersky side quickly a couple of

914
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,950
things that I'm tracking now I am very

915
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,710
interested in who else is writing these

916
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:07,049
so-called apt style reports to to

917
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,230
companies on paying attention to Jeju

918
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:12,329
360 Chinese company they probably outed

919
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,900
a Vietnamese hacking team with one of

920
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:21,480
their reports that was ocean Lotus or

921
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:23,790
sea Lotus also ante labs and let's see

922
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,859
if we get there we go ante labs they

923
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,109
believe they found someone and it's so

924
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:30,359
funny because they saw evidence that

925
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:32,308
cobalt strike was used they decided to

926
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,270
try to docks the guy who created cobalt

927
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:35,160
strike

928
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,410
they found apparently his page on

929
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,540
blackhat and used that as his bio in

930
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,910
their report Dutch just copied it

931
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,619
verbatim so that's it you know the Chi

932
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,990
360 reports probably a little bit better

933
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:49,200
than this one there you know but I like

934
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:51,089
to see the the development over time I'm

935
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,189
gonna close with talking about some

936
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:57,960
risks so Trust is an issue here I saw a

937
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,700
tweet come up from belem cat and he

938
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,910
talked about whether or not there were

939
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,430
cluster bombs being used in Syria and he

940
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,450
went to a video and so I read I looked

941
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,970
at that and I said well I don't really

942
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,368
know what cluster bombs look like and

943
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,959
it's sure enough there's this huge back

944
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,910
and forth between these two analysts in

945
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,260
the video comments like you're an idiot

946
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,180
no you're not you're an idiot no you're

947
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,829
not I'm not whatever about whether or

948
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,779
not their cluster bombs being used so

949
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:23,099
you just can't trust what you see just

950
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,630
because Belling Katz said it doesn't

951
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:30,690
doesn't make it true secondly some

952
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:33,270
people just go too far this is an

953
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:36,450
example from malware delue it's a group

954
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:38,880
up in Luxembourg who were so inspired by

955
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:42,509
the EPT one report they decided to hack

956
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,740
the Chinese and what they said was when

957
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,329
I first read the report it looked like

958
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,970
they had taken the IP ranges that we

959
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:50,790
enlisted in our report and scan them for

960
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,640
poison ivy servers exploited the public

961
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,920
vulnerability in them and then found all

962
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,960
kinds of stolen data so it turns out all

963
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,160
of that is true except the IP range part

964
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,420
what they did was the IP ranges are the

965
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,399
ones in the middle table those are from

966
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,319
the apt one report the range is at the

967
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,109
bottom are from their report they just

968
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:12,359
picked out IP ranges in Hong Kong for

969
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:14,700
whatever reason I don't know and just

970
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:17,910
scan those found all the vulnerable

971
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,410
poison ivy servers exploited them and of

972
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,509
course they found stolen data which I

973
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,640
thought was you know interesting but to

974
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,809
me this is going too far yes this is

975
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,970
something the private sector could do

976
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:28,859
you may be asked by our clients to do

977
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,649
this sometimes the government people ask

978
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:32,940
would this be possible I don't recommend

979
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,119
doing this I think there's gold bit too

980
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,119
far

981
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:40,740
pursuing defense personnel this is an

982
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,049
example where this gentleman in the

983
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,959
picture in the center he was caught in a

984
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:49,589
so-called honey trap where he fell for

985
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,700
someone posing as a someone who was

986
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:52,980
interested and interested in him

987
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,419
romantically and basically this honey

988
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,079
trap got him to spill a bunch of

989
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,150
pakistani isi intelligence service

990
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:02,579
information so the equivalent of the

991
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:05,609
pakistani anonymous said i know what

992
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,500
we'll do we're gonna be honey traps for

993
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:09,299
all of our Intel people we're gonna fish

994
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,799
them all we're gonna LinkedIn them all

995
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:12,599
we're gonna connect to them all and

996
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:13,170
we're gonna try to get information out

997
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,280
of them any

998
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,030
one that does it we're gonna turn them

999
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,619
over the government okay guys like turn

1000
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,770
it three notches down that's a little

1001
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:24,839
bit too far in my opinion basically

1002
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,720
attacking your own intelligence service

1003
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:31,890
to show how bad they are and I think

1004
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:35,339
that's going a little too far five

1005
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,629
minutes this is another one that was

1006
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:39,020
really interesting

1007
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:42,059
those are Delta Force guys in Libya and

1008
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:44,910
how are they outed the Libyan Air Force

1009
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,920
posted their pictures on Facebook on the

1010
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,710
Libyan Air Force Facebook page and

1011
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,799
someone noticed it and said hey what's

1012
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:55,349
Delta Force doing in Tripoli and of

1013
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:56,910
course as soon as that happens the swarm

1014
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:59,640
of open-source Intel people

1015
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,589
jumps on it and said well I can track

1016
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,910
where their plane was because there was

1017
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:05,009
a photo of the plane and they get the

1018
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,509
tail number and pretty soon this entire

1019
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,030
thing is out and the guys had to leave

1020
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,920
the country

1021
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:12,809
just because some people who weren't

1022
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,460
thinking good OPSEC posted pictures on

1023
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:15,690
facebook actually the Libyans were

1024
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,859
probably like hey look at us we're with

1025
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,230
Delta Force it's none of the big guns

1026
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:21,900
this is cool put it on Facebook and boom

1027
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,579
there you go oh and mediately there's

1028
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,780
analysis of it right immediately on

1029
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,020
Twitter people are talking about what's

1030
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,420
going on what does this mean whatever

1031
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:34,770
the final risk I'll leave you with is is

1032
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,450
personal and this also involves you one

1033
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,190
of the Kaspersky researchers put

1034
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,669
together an academic paper about this

1035
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,200
talking about risks to individuals who

1036
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,470
are doing this sort of open source

1037
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,700
intelligence and he talks about or one

1038
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,950
of the people I think was a ESET

1039
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,069
researcher talks about when he was doing

1040
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,689
analysis of Stuxnet finding out that his

1041
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:58,308
apartment had been broken into and

1042
00:41:54,690 --> 00:42:01,020
someone had put one of those little

1043
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:03,270
little toys where you shaky and it gives

1044
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,210
you a little message yes no call again

1045
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:08,150
later whatever they had the whoever the

1046
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:12,180
intruder was had left the take a break

1047
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,500
sign pointed upwards meaning hey stop

1048
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,839
for the research that you're doing on

1049
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,410
Stuxnet so I can think of who that is

1050
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,660
and given given and put this round dot I

1051
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:26,339
doubt it was us there's another country

1052
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,910
who is very aggressive I'm studying Krav

1053
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,250
Maga

1054
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,299
that gives you a hints who I think will

1055
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,530
do something like that if you know

1056
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:33,180
anything about Krav Maga these guys are

1057
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:36,660
direct to the point we're getting our

1058
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,740
message through so this this could I

1059
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,808
don't want to say this could happen to

1060
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,848
you but you never know right this this

1061
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:43,770
is a whole nother area it's great that

1062
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:46,770
we have all these capabilities but you

1063
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:49,410
know we might have to watch ourselves so

1064
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:51,150
I hope with this presentation I've

1065
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,618
exposed you to a little bit of the wider

1066
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,640
revolution and private sector

1067
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,020
intelligence but I've also made a

1068
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,250
relevant to what's been happening here

1069
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,309
so if you haven't seen some of these

1070
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:02,789
things you should do it and I would

1071
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:04,109
recommend obviously haven't read the apt

1072
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:07,319
one report I got to say read that one

1073
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:09,058
but read these two you know this is from

1074
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:11,069
our world here in the cyber world to the

1075
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:12,510
camera-shy report and then this is from

1076
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:14,549
outside our world in the bigger

1077
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:17,000
geopolitical world the hiding in plain

1078
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:20,220
sight report from Atlantic Council

1079
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,880
so with that happy to take questions

1080
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:26,598
quickly good first thank you excellent

1081
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,380
presentation very stimulating Thanks I

1082
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,750
wondered if you could elaborate a little

1083
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,029
bit on the malware glue example that you

1084
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,700
gave yeah and specifically why you

1085
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:39,029
consider it going too far is it because

1086
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:45,200
of harm to bystanders or is it because

1087
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:47,279
of the imperfect court collaboration of

1088
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,390
association between the IP address

1089
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:53,279
ranges or some any legality or ethics

1090
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,368
you know what specifically do you think

1091
00:43:53,279 --> 00:44:00,539
is too far in that yeah I think taking

1092
00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:01,920
exploitive activities are breaking into

1093
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,529
somebody's computer to gather evidence

1094
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,089
is a little bit too far i I'm in the

1095
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:07,529
camp that says let's leave that to law

1096
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:09,390
enforcement leave that to the

1097
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:11,039
intelligence agencies I feel like when

1098
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,690
we start doing that we might lose a

1099
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,579
little bit of our moral authority to the

1100
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,670
extent we have some so anything that

1101
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:18,779
involves launching exploits to get into

1102
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,609
somebody's system I think is a little

1103
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:23,670
bit too far now if you scan those

1104
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:27,420
systems and you find web servers on them

1105
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:29,730
and they're just serving up pages that

1106
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,190
to me is in essentially public domain or

1107
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:35,069
an open ftp server or something like

1108
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,109
that but when you have to do remote code

1109
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:38,369
execution to get access to it I think

1110
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:40,549
you've probably stuff a little bit too

1111
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:40,549
far

1112
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:47,240
yes sir thanks it was awesome

1113
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:51,109
presentation oh hey I was wondering if

1114
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,970
you could comment on because it's a

1115
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:55,069
private sector and ultimately the profit

1116
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,779
motive drives the private sector so you

1117
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:59,240
have government folks who are reluctant

1118
00:44:56,779 --> 00:45:00,650
or suspicious of private sector

1119
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,140
intelligence because ultimately the

1120
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:05,559
organization's goal is to make money and

1121
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,670
that can slant intelligence or slant um

1122
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:10,009
sometimes exaggeration of the threat

1123
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:13,039
which we see a lot in cyber in

1124
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:14,660
particular and the I just want to defang

1125
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,099
one counter-argument very quickly is

1126
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,750
that sometimes when we ask these

1127
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:19,369
questions of private sector intelligence

1128
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,930
organizations they'll say well we're

1129
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:22,789
interested in protecting the nation too

1130
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,819
and we would never do something right

1131
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:28,160
and into which case I bring up the 2008

1132
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:29,329
financial crisis where an industry the

1133
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,640
financial industry collectively

1134
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:34,759
basically committed suicide on those in

1135
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,319
pursuit of money what what assurances

1136
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:38,240
can you offer or what comments can you

1137
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,470
make to to counter that argument for

1138
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,029
government customers who may want to

1139
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,799
consume these products yeah it's a it's

1140
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:46,400
a perfectly legitimate question I think

1141
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:51,049
reputation is where it's at reputation

1142
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:53,000
and brand so if someone comes out of the

1143
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:54,980
gate with the new report I've never

1144
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,529
heard of this company I've never heard

1145
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,420
of this group perhaps I'm going to be a

1146
00:45:57,529 --> 00:46:01,700
little bit more skeptical but if it

1147
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,319
comes from a shop that over time has

1148
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,759
demonstrated they put out good things

1149
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:06,829
and they pan out and there's their

1150
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:08,240
sourcing is good it's funny we're having

1151
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:10,339
to turn into academics you know the best

1152
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,740
reports as far as I'm concerned they

1153
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:14,630
cite other sources they're very specific

1154
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,098
they pull in experts from other fields

1155
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,829
it's a whole set of things you can look

1156
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:21,950
at to tell if a report is on the way to

1157
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:22,970
being a good report if you see and this

1158
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,348
is where that's funny some of the

1159
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:26,209
reports from the other countries out

1160
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,680
there who just aren't there yet you know

1161
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,750
they just make these assumptions and

1162
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,480
they don't give you any references or or

1163
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:34,359
cite anyone else I dismiss those so I

1164
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,359
think reputation is one of the biggest

1165
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:41,538
defenses you can use yes we work

1166
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:43,308
together our last question all right um

1167
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:45,109
so I think we've already seen this in

1168
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:46,609
the more advanced users of social media

1169
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:50,869
but and thank you for the presentation

1170
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:52,369
um but do you think that we're gonna so

1171
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:53,300
we've already seen some clumsy attempts

1172
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:55,640
by the Russians

1173
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,900
the Ukraine and other people this I

1174
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,819
think what we're seeing now is we're

1175
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,260
seeing a surge in this crowdsourcing of

1176
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,760
open intelligence but you can hack

1177
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,730
crowdsourcing there was a recent article

1178
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,200
about the DARPA challenge in 2011 it was

1179
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:09,200
crowdsource being totally screwed up by

1180
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,180
one or two determined people um do you

1181
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,740
think that this is going to last without

1182
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,120
people messing with it or do you think

1183
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,129
there's gonna be a counterintelligence

1184
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,299
surge towards screwing with people doing

1185
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,830
open-source intelligence in the near

1186
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,200
future such a wonderful question because

1187
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:23,840
so often in our field we have a very

1188
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,939
static view like use cyber hygiene and

1189
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,320
you're okay well no that's not true

1190
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,570
right if this is an iterative process

1191
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,900
between offense and defense and it's the

1192
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:36,190
same thing here so as you see people

1193
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,330
have success with this approach

1194
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:41,030
determined adversaries are gonna figure

1195
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:43,370
out counters now that by itself will

1196
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:45,920
tell you something because who has some

1197
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:47,810
of the better OPSEC in the world us the

1198
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,490
Russians the Israelis people have been

1199
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,950
doing this stuff for a while so when you

1200
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:53,330
can't determine who an attacker is that

1201
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,620
immediately puts me thinking into a

1202
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,210
certain number of categories about who

1203
00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:00,290
these guys could be they're probably

1204
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:03,650
more the high-end so yes this is a

1205
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:06,500
problem it's almost like internet voting

1206
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,060
right or just voting in general when the

1207
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,660
stakes become high enough people figure

1208
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:13,790
out a way to break it so we will have to

1209
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,379
be cognizant of that as you take a look

1210
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,670
at this analysis I would hope we would

1211
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,620
get to the point where we have enough

1212
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:22,490
counters so that this just doesn't is

1213
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:24,710
useless I mean you could imagine just

1214
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:27,680
because I showed a picture of what

1215
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:29,600
looked like a su-24 in Aisle 76 those

1216
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,399
could have been giant blow-up dummies

1217
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,410
right like we used in World War two

1218
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,140
actually work where the Serbs used in in

1219
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:38,210
96 but we're not there yet because these

1220
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,680
guys are being caught off off guard they

1221
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,890
didn't expect that we would be able to

1222
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,970
photograph them it's good question oh

1223
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:47,080
thank you Richard it's great to have you

1224
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,080
back again that gave a talk
