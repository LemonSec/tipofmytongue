1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,636
(soft electronic music)

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,712
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,347
- I want to talk to you about
intelligence preparation

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,183
of the cyber environment.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,818
Here we go.

6
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,186
As Rebecca pointed out,

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,655
actually a soldier,
not an officer,

8
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,125
but yes, British
army/military intelligence.

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,362
Some of you may have remembered
my talk from last year.

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,796
Not much has really changed,

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,399
the two things that
really have changed

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,434
in this last year for me is,

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,669
I got myself an avatar, and

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,571
I've been promoted.

15
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,641
I'm the director
of intelligence,

16
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,144
and also now the CEO
of a company called
Security Alliance.

17
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,048
I'm also a CREST-certified
threat intelligence manager,

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,183
which in some
parts of the world,

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,485
in order to create
threat assessments

20
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,487
for parts of critical
infrastructure,

21
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,655
not only does your organization

22
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,756
have to be certified to do so,

23
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,525
but so do the people that do it.

24
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,992
I'm one of those people.

25
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,195
I'm actually working on
things like CBEST engagements

26
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,496
and threat landscape work.

27
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,599
Two particular
areas of interest,

28
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,436
insider threat and nation
state fusion warfare.

29
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,005
Really, how
information operations,

30
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,339
intelligence operations,

31
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,408
conventional warfare,
cyber warfare,

32
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,078
how are all those glorious
things coming together,

33
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,513
and what's conflict gonna
look like in the future?

34
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,615
As well as all that,

35
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,618
I'm also an associate
director for Gartner

36
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,853
for cyber threat intelligence

37
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,655
for their media
consultancy team.

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,059
As I said, I'm from a military
intelligence background,

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,162
and that's really why I'm
here wanting to talk to you

40
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,730
about what IPB is

41
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,932
and what intelligence
preparation

42
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,333
of the cyber environment is,

43
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,602
'cause it's kind of
my old-school craft.

44
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,070
It's what I'm doing now,

45
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,439
but I've just taken it
into the cyber environment.

46
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,409
This was me last year,

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,610
and what I want to do this year

48
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,513
is I just wanna progress
from where I was.

49
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,048
Last year,

50
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,284
I talked about conventional
intelligence methodologies

51
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,321
and how we are adapting
those into cyber.

52
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,023
I talked about wonderful things

53
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:09,027
such as murder boarding,
devil's advocate, 10th man,

54
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,432
all these things that
we do to check our work.

55
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,367
I talked about cones
of plausibility

56
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,302
and how we can
take our scenarios,

57
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
look for variables,

58
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,471
and work out what potentially

59
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,140
is gonna be happening
in the future,

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,107
and also some of
those wild card things

61
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,810
that are happening as well.

62
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,111
I talked about backcasting,

63
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,147
so, that's effectively going,

64
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,415
this is where all my
really cool stuff is,

65
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,451
and this is what people
wanna get from me.

66
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,087
These are my crown
jewels and my key assets.

67
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,054
This is where the
threat actors are.

68
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,424
What's the stuff that
happens in the middle,

69
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,993
how are we gonna work that out?

70
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,232
And then, towards the end, I
had about two minutes on this.

71
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,368
I said, "Why are we doing
all of these things?

72
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,936
"Why are we using
all these methods?"

73
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,005
Well, what we're
trying to do is reach

74
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,941
intelligence preparation
of the battlefield.

75
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,744
This is the definition
I gave at the time.

76
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,412
I'll just go into it in
a little bit more detail

77
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,680
in two seconds.

78
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,583
Effectively, what I
was saying was IPB.

79
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,152
Now, there is intelligence
preparation of the battlespace,

80
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,488
as well as intelligence
preparation of the battlefield

81
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,990
and intelligence preparation
of the environment.

82
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,225
All slightly different things,

83
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,793
but I'll come on to
that in a second.

84
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,328
But what is IPB?

85
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,232
It's effectively
the stuff, right?

86
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,100
To find the battlefield
environment,

87
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,736
where's my employees,
where is my supply chain,

88
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,505
where are all my
assets, what's in it,

89
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,106
where are all of the things?

90
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,841
What are the things
that affect them?

91
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,310
Rick mentioned it this morning,

92
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,512
I talked about it last year
with PESTLE-M, STEMPLES,

93
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,380
some of those
sub-headings that help us

94
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,281
determine those things.

95
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,550
Evaluate the threat.

96
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,819
Who are they, who
are the bad guys,

97
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,321
why are they coming after me,

98
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,156
what they're after, how
are they getting to do it,

99
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,792
and what those attacks are
actually gonna look like.

100
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,294
What are the courses of action

101
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,495
which to you and me are,

102
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,464
you know, what are
the threat scenarios?

103
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,966
That's what IPB was.

104
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,502
It was trying to get some form
of 360-degree understanding

105
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,671
of what was happening
within my environment.

106
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,808
Now, last year, I was
telling you all how

107
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,344
I was a bit of a weirdo and
everything is in notebooks.

108
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,879
I work in cyber, but I
don't like computers.

109
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,118
Effectively, I've
regressed a little bit.

110
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,418
I don't have my
notebooks, and natch,

111
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,321
I just draw on the
wall behind my desk

112
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,724
and stick things to it.

113
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,058
This is my research around
intelligence preparation

114
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,494
in the cyber environment.

115
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,895
What I really want
to cover today

116
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,897
is just some definitions
around the differences

117
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,933
between battlespace,
battlefield environment,

118
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,335
and actually what a
cyber environment is.

119
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,904
I just wanna also pull out
some of those techniques

120
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,506
that I talked about last year,

121
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,474
and show you where we've
potentially used those

122
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,410
within the methodology of IPB.

123
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,114
Talk about the stages, that's
the important stuff, isn't it?

124
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,982
How are we doing
this within cyber,

125
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,719
and why?

126
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,122
What can we do with IPCE,
why are we doing it,

127
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,556
what's the fallout for it,

128
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,525
and what we should be doing
with it in the future.

129
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,861
And then, just share the
three main references.

130
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,829
There's a lot of references
that I used for the research

131
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,632
for those three particular
cases that are really strong.

132
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,836
So, intelligence preparation
of the battlefield.

133
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,872
This is the definition.

134
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,508
The definition comes
from the good old US Army

135
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,342
and the US Marine Corps.

136
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,245
I dropped the British
one from last year.

137
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,180
But we don't really
wanna know about IPB.

138
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,416
We wanna know about
intelligence preparation

139
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,183
of the cyber environment.

140
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,053
Now, bad news.

141
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,554
There is no definition

142
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,856
for intelligence preparation
of the cyber environment,

143
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,258
so I made one up.

144
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,827
I stole stuff from other
people and other places.

145
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,597
Really, this slide
should probably have me

146
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:35,101
in a turtleneck jumper
on a dark background

147
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,336
with this definition next to it,

148
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,637
and the name and date.

149
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,872
But effectively, this is
what I've come up with.

150
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,508
IPCE, intelligence preparation
of the cyber environment,

151
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,811
is a systematic and
continuous process

152
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,979
of analyzing the means and
motives of threat actors,

153
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,415
your digital environment

154
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,918
and the digital environment
in which you operate

155
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,720
in order to understand
the likely scenarios

156
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,221
in which you will face threat,

157
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,458
hopefully enhancing your
operational resiliency.

158
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,059
That's what I see IPCE as.

159
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,096
Again, like I
said, I made it up.

160
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,764
There's somebody out there
who's much better at this

161
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,833
and will probably make
a better definition.

162
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,402
There's some fallout on that,

163
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,404
why I've included
certain things.

164
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,107
Old IP, I've
included continuous.

165
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,342
IPCE is something
that we're just doing.

166
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,044
Chances are, I'm actually
doing IPCE anyway,

167
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,748
but I've just put a name on
it and stolen it for myself,

168
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,715
and made money out of you.

169
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,082
That's what I do, I'm a vendor.

170
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,319
Anyway, so,

171
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,422
another key point is
Carnegie Mellon University,

172
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,690
I think they borrowed this

173
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,493
from the Naval War
College, actually.

174
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,929
"The key to success in defining
the virtual environment

175
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,400
"is to analyze it from an
adversarial point of view."

176
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,869
absolutely key, and I have
a slide on that in a moment,

177
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,238
so we're gonna park that,
and I'll come back to it.

178
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,172
Why are we doing it?

179
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,808
Well, US CERT sums it up.

180
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,778
The ability to organization
to achieve its mission

181
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,313
even when you're a
bit under attack.

182
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,082
And effectively, SANS,
thank you very much,

183
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,385
"It (IPB) needs to be
part of rehearsals,

184
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,887
"simulation, testing,
and development now."

185
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,522
I'm gonna pull this one out

186
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,390
into a specific slide
in a moment as well,

187
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,459
'cause again, that's
really important.

188
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,395
I promised, so, from last year,

189
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,697
those methodologies and
where we can use them.

190
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,469
When we are talking
about scenarios,

191
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,969
and I'm talking
about looking at it

192
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,240
from an adversarial point
of view, red team SWOT.

193
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,944
That's less what my
strengths and weaknesses.

194
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,145
That's the enemy going,

195
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,880
right, what are my strengths

196
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,049
when I'm gonna be
targeting Rob Dartnall?

197
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,018
What opportunities
is Rob giving me

198
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,253
in order to attack him?

199
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,655
What weaknesses have I got?

200
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,989
How, potentially, can
that be determined?

201
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,293
Cones of plausibility,

202
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,861
when you're looking
at your scenarios.

203
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,596
We know what these
scenarios look like,

204
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,097
but let's look at
some of those drivers

205
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,200
and those assumptions that
we've made and change them,

206
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,700
and see how those
scenarios can change,

207
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,103
and then also include
those in our playbooks.

208
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,371
And scenario generation,

209
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,240
and my favorite, I
love backcasting.

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,409
You know, working
out what's happened.

211
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,145
But what's important,
horizon scanning.

212
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,246
For me, quite often,

213
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,716
these exercises and
what we do with IPCE

214
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,719
is like a single point
in time exercise.

215
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,087
What we need to do is go,

216
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,723
what's changing in the future?

217
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,758
What's out there that's gonna
have an influence on me?

218
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,627
What's my organization
gonna be like

219
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,229
in a year, two years' time?

220
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,164
What's my technology,
what's my strategy,

221
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,599
how is that gonna
evolve, and therefore,

222
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,200
how's my landscape
going to change?

223
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,703
If you can get
there, good for you.

224
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,936
Most people can't.

225
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,305
So, IPB, then.

226
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,040
Still not quite on IPCE, sorry.

227
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,475
We'll get there eventually.

228
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,344
These are the four
stages, primarily.

229
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,982
Three main areas of research.

230
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,951
Carnegie Mellon Software
Engineering Institute,

231
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,654
they wrote a paper on
operational resiliency.

232
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:46,392
The US Army, military doctrine,
and the SANS Institute.

233
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,494
You can see that they're
all fairly similar,

234
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,862
they're not too dissimilar.

235
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,531
But effectively, step one,

236
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,665
I love the terminology
of the SEO.

237
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,601
Determine the voice
of the environment.

238
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,538
That's very 2018, isn't it?

239
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,641
Define the operational
environment, define
the battlefield.

240
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,510
All of the things.

241
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,346
Step two, determine the
voice of the organization,

242
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,814
which is fine,

243
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,550
but there's also external
forces that have an influence.

244
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,919
For me, it's more along
the lines of SANS,

245
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,388
define the effect on the
battlefield effectively.

246
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,291
Step three, determine the
voice of the threat actor,

247
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,359
because threat actors
have voices and opinions

248
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,228
and emotions as well,

249
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,630
and evaluate the threat.

250
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,832
Step four, describe use cases.

251
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,534
For me, use cases
are really important

252
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,936
to help drive your
courses of action,

253
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,070
but they are different.

254
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,471
But really, step four,

255
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,774
what are those courses
of action gonna be?

256
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,641
But that's IPB.

257
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,410
IPCE.

258
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,780
People that know
me know that I am,

259
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,015
I really like simple,
plain English,

260
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,516
especially intelligence.

261
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,587
The secret to intelligence is
really strong dissemination.

262
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,789
We all know in our industry,

263
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,625
we're really bad at
verbalizing things.

264
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,860
We're very bad at
disseminating our intelligence

265
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,163
and making it
appealing to the board

266
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,398
and other people within
our organization.

267
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,567
I put things in layman's
terms all the time.

268
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,035
It's actually mostly
'cause I'm dyslexic

269
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,070
and I can't understand words
with more than three syllables,

270
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,772
but it's fine.

271
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,608
What does it really mean,
what are we looking at?

272
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,575
Operational environment,

273
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,012
what's affecting the
operational environment,

274
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,781
who are the bad guys, and how
are they coming out at me?

275
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,316
Know yourself,
know the bad guys,

276
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,686
know what different
compromises look like,

277
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,456
and know all of the things
that are gonna influence

278
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,924
the bad guys in my environment.

279
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,858
It's pretty simple, right?

280
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,327
Probably mostly doing it,

281
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,863
'cause effectively, where
we're trying to go is

282
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,199
situational awareness.

283
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,867
Now, situational awareness
is a glorious thing

284
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,770
that you will never achieve.

285
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,672
It is something
you aspire to get,

286
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,973
but you'll never quite get there

287
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,541
because the environment
is constantly changing.

288
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,779
But effectively, I think this
is a really great definition.

289
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,614
"The perception of the
elements in the environment

290
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,884
"within a volume
of time and space,

291
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,419
"the comprehension
of their meaning,

292
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,088
"and the projection of their
status into the near future."

293
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,992
Okay, that's fine.

294
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,728
But basically, perception of

295
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,664
everything within
my environment,

296
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,733
understanding what's happening
with them and around them,

297
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,536
and projection of what that's
gonna play out in the future.

298
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,103
That's effectively
what we're aiming for

299
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,173
with situational awareness.

300
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,610
Now, as I said, for me,
this is really important.

301
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,645
"The key to success in
analyzing the environment

302
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,881
"is to assess it from
the enemy perspective."

303
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,052
Forget about IPCE for a minute.

304
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,920
Think about you as analysts.

305
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,988
You should be finding
yourselves in this mindset

306
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,424
most of the time.

307
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,393
It's great what you understand
your environment to be,

308
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,028
and what you perceive
the threats to be,

309
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,830
and what you perceive
to be critical data,

310
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,065
but the enemy's gonna have

311
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,467
a pretty different
opinion about them.

312
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,901
Their mindset's
slightly different,

313
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,237
and they're gonna look
at things differently.

314
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,771
Given the situations,

315
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,307
they may be interested in
something slightly different

316
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,010
to what you were
predominantly expecting.

317
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,411
We always need to think about it

318
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,878
from a red team point of view.

319
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,016
But it's not just that,
there's somebody else as well.

320
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,983
There's three perspectives.

321
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,788
There's my perspective, there's
the enemy's perspective,

322
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,490
and then there's the business.

323
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,691
There's neutral forces.

324
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,926
There's other employees,

325
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,096
there's my clients,
there's customers.

326
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,964
There's always three
perspectives to everything,

327
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,199
and you need to
always look at it

328
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,068
from those three
different perspectives

329
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,704
in order to have a
really good understanding

330
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,238
of the environment.

331
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,408
Right, we're getting
there, I promise.

332
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,509
Let's get into it.

333
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,444
Determine the
operational environment.

334
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,280
That's where we are
in step one of IPCE.

335
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,116
Now, you're gonna
see some mind maps.

336
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,785
These are not exhaustive.

337
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,819
This mind map is this big.

338
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,655
It should be this big.

339
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,257
They are there to give
you some starting points

340
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,426
and some ideas.

341
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,495
Determining your
operational environment,

342
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,032
big, tough gig, right?

343
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,034
Try and break it
down into two areas.

344
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,337
Your environment,
what you control,

345
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,306
your IT architecture,
your network diagrams,

346
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,675
your physical, tangible
things that you've got,

347
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,777
your servers, your
racks, your firewalls,

348
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,446
all of these things.

349
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,882
The software and the
applications that
they're built on,

350
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,583
the operating systems,

351
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,986
all of the vulnerabilities
that are attached to them.

352
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,121
Where is your data
and your information

353
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,289
when it's in transit?

354
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,858
Where is it when
it's being processed?

355
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,993
This is your
operational environment,

356
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,495
and this is not an easy task.

357
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,999
I will argue with
anyone that tells me

358
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,269
that they know their operation
environment 100% of the time

359
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,271
and where their data
is all of the time.

360
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,906
But then you need to look at it

361
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,408
from an external point of view.

362
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,477
Where's all of that data
outside of my environment?

363
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,347
What are my employees
leaking on their profiles?

364
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,915
Where's my data within
my supply chain?

365
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,718
Where's my data within my
supply chain's supply chain?

366
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,120
What cloud services,

367
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,156
what shadow services
are my employees using

368
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,723
on things like Dropbox?

369
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,994
Where are they leaking code
on code repositories like,

370
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,663
well, there's loads of them.

371
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,431
That's what you've
got to try and find.

372
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,666
I mean, hands up,

373
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,769
who here has ever
done full recon

374
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,505
on their own organization
from an enemy's point of view

375
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,540
to see what can be
used to target you?

376
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,510
Who does that regularly?

377
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,545
Awesome, it's a
really fun exercise,

378
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,580
and I know a lot of
vendors do that for you,

379
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,182
but that's what effectively
you're trying to do.

380
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,650
You're trying to be the enemy

381
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,786
and find all of those things
that could be used against you.

382
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,255
Credentials that are being
leaked as part of breaches,

383
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,757
documents that could be
weaponized that are sensitive,

384
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,827
that could be fed back
into your organization.

385
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,996
Step two, we know
all of the things,

386
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,997
but what affects those things?

387
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,600
Now, before I move into this,

388
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,202
this can sometimes be a bit
of a difficult exercise.

389
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,304
I remember when I first started

390
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,742
my army/military
intelligence training,

391
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,776
a bit into it, I
started doing strategic,

392
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,146
or I had the strategic
intelligence role,

393
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,781
and you had to put your
head into a position

394
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,618
where you were trying
to perceive things

395
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,419
that you didn't really
have a big grasp on.

396
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,853
I was quite young at the time,

397
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,189
and it was quite difficult
for me to understand

398
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,625
what geopolitics
in Southeast Asia

399
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,294
were affecting the role that
I was doing based in London.

400
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,930
There seemed to be a disconnect,

401
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,364
but there's always a connect.

402
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,635
We talked about
STEMPLES and PESTLE-M.

403
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,872
In reading my US military
doctrine for this presentation,

404
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,707
I came across a new one.

405
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,476
PMESII-PT,

406
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,610
not very cool.

407
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,981
Legal is missing, so it
should probably be PMESII-PTL.

408
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,052
I'd probably stick with PESTLE-M
or STEMPLEs, personally.

409
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,287
But these are the subheadings

410
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,621
that can give you
a starting point

411
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,889
to try and think about

412
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,325
the effects on your
environment, right?

413
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,062
Again, this mind map should
be 10 times the size it is.

414
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,665
It's just an idea and
some starting points.

415
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,200
What politics,
national, geopolitics

416
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,937
are affecting my environment?

417
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,438
There's a caveat to this.

418
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,808
Everyone in this room comes
from a different organization.

419
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,277
Some of your organizations
are hundreds,

420
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,113
some of them are
tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands.

421
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,448
You may operate in the US,

422
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,750
you may operate in 128
different countries.

423
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,520
You might operate in
oil and gas, pharma,

424
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,356
you may work in
government, whatever.

425
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,426
Some of these influences
will be completely different,

426
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,227
in fact, all of them will
be completely different

427
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,829
for every single one of you.

428
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,497
So, President Trump
doesn't sign off

429
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,735
on the current
restrictions against Iran.

430
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,203
What effect is that
gonna have on you

431
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,839
and your organization and your
data and your information?

432
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,409
Go toe-to-toe with North Korea,

433
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,411
actually enter into
a military conflict.

434
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,982
Brexit for me, being a Brit.

435
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,216
In a couple of years,

436
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,185
we're either gonna be
swimming in the cash

437
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,587
or we're gonna be broke
as anything, right?

438
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,289
How's that gonna
affect my organization,

439
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,124
how much budget am I
gonna have in the future

440
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,561
or am I not gonna have,
probably not gonna have.

441
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,529
Climate change exists, people,

442
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,798
so how many people are
gonna be working from home

443
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,167
because the office is
being flooded or whatever,

444
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,369
opening up parts of your network

445
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,838
that you've never had
to open up before?

446
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,207
That's all great, that's
effect on the outside,

447
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,341
but those effects

448
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,044
occur on the inside as well.

449
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,846
What's my internal
politics like?

450
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,214
What's the board's appetite

451
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,283
towards cyber and
information assurance?

452
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,386
What's the business strategy?

453
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,754
Are we going digital,

454
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,922
are we bringing
everything back in-house,

455
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,991
are we outsourcing everything?

456
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,658
Are we trying to
make as much cash

457
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,695
as we possibly can to float,

458
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:13,232
so I've got no IT spend,
I've got no security spend?

459
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,336
These are all things that have
a physical, tangible effect

460
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,337
on your environment.

461
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,740
Step three, determining
the badness.

462
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,614
Ultimately, you wanna know who,
what, where, when, how, why.

463
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,815
But how do you answer that?

464
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,583
Some of you probably
have a really good idea.

465
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,353
You've got use cases
from your internal SOCs,

466
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,821
you're part of ISACs,

467
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,091
you've got use cases from
similar organizations.

468
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,559
You've got a pretty
good grasp of it.

469
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,829
But what happens if you
haven't, and you don't know?

470
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,563
You're brand-new
to your CTI team,

471
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,200
or your CTI team is,
in fact, brand-new.

472
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,836
It's an exciting place to be,
I'm quite jealous, actually.

473
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,372
OCGs, you can start big, right?

474
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,909
This is just a financial
services institution.

475
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,910
Very generic.

476
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,111
Start by categories.

477
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,512
You don't have to start going,

478
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,681
ABG 28, it's the Russians,
it's the Russians,

479
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,615
it's the Russians!

480
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,117
It's always the Russians.

481
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,486
It can just be on the financial
services organization.

482
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,657
Organized crime groups are
gonna be interested in me.

483
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,260
Insiders have got access
to a lot of trading data.

484
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,163
Nation states, because I
operate in 50 countries,

485
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,965
are interested in dissident data

486
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,801
based on their massive
amounts of PII that I have.

487
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,370
You can start that big,
and that is perfectly fine.

488
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,372
I personally use a
capability and intent score.

489
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,210
Times capability and intent,

490
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,378
capability being a
score of one to five,

491
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,147
intent being a score
to one to five.

492
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,081
It starts giving me a direction

493
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,384
to start looking for
particular actors.

494
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,886
Once I know that
organization crime groups

495
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,387
are interested in me,

496
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,590
I can probably start pulling
those use cases and going,

497
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,493
okay, FIN6, FIN7, Carbanak.

498
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,027
These are the
organized crime groups,

499
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,462
these are their capabilities,

500
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,065
this is their intent
towards my organization.

501
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,135
I can start to have a
bit of a better idea

502
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,536
of who those organizations,

503
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,872
sorry, who are those
threat actors coming at me.

504
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,275
What do you wanna collect
on those threat actors?

505
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,279
Depends on how much
resource you've got.

506
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,414
Depends how much
time you've got.

507
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,517
This is just what I collect,

508
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,052
this is just a screenshot from
our threat match platform.

509
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,288
It's kind of, who are they?

510
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,556
What's their use cases?

511
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,791
What's their intent,
what's their motives?

512
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,996
What are their TTPs
at each aspect,

513
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,865
or, sorry, each element, if
they're in a cyber kill chain?

514
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,634
Who are they associated with?

515
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,235
What are they likely to
be doing in the future,

516
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,703
what languages do they speak?

517
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,273
All that kind of stuff

518
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,274
is really good
information to collect

519
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,110
on the people that
are targeting you.

520
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,414
Oh, malware, that's pretty
helpful to know as well,

521
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,615
what malware and tool sets

522
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,551
they're using is
fundamental, really.

523
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,351
What about the scenarios?

524
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,687
Right, we discussed
this earlier.

525
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,789
There's two sets of
scenarios, right?

526
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,791
There's the most
likeliest scenarios,

527
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,860
the ones that we're probably
going to see or are seeing,

528
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,463
and then there's the
most dangerous scenarios,

529
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,199
those ones that are less likely,

530
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,970
but really high-impact and
worst-case scenarios for us.

531
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,873
We need to document all of
them and show our working.

532
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,875
Your scenarios can
just be really generic

533
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,410
and a sentence long.

534
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,647
OCGX is going to target
my cash management system

535
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,349
in order to steal cash.

536
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,649
Pretty simple, right?

537
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,485
We can start with
our capability.

538
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,353
We know now we're
talking about FIN7,

539
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,023
so we can give them a
capability score of four.

540
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,491
We know what they're after

541
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,461
because they've previously
attacked that payment system.

542
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,929
I've got that payment system.

543
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,364
Intent high.

544
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,499
I'm a big-profile
bank, threat scores.

545
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,770
I've put opportunity and
impact at the bottom.

546
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,609
Impact is really important
to start assessing

547
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,110
from this point of view.

548
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,777
What's the so-what, what's
the fallout for the business,

549
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,247
'cause remember,

550
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,581
you're trying to tell a
story to the business, right?

551
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,350
It's not just about
what's impacting me

552
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,586
as a cybersecurity
professional or in the SOC,

553
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,055
it's what's the impact
to the business.

554
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,157
Opportunity is harder
to gauge at this point.

555
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,559
Opportunity will come
when you actually

556
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,594
start to rehearse and simulate
some of these attacks,

557
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,763
but I'll go into
that in a second.

558
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,567
And, like I said back from
2017, timeline analysis,

559
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,270
but backcasting is
really cool for this.

560
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,206
This is the payment system
that they are gonna go after.

561
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,706
This is where they
are right now.

562
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,577
What have they gotta do in
order to get to that system?

563
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,246
What am I gonna see, what
are the combat indicators,

564
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,248
what are the flags
that are gonna crop up?

565
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,416
When I see these things,

566
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,618
I can start to attribute
attack to somebody

567
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,321
or identify a particular
type of attack.

568
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,724
How you do is a scenario
is, doesn't really matter.

569
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,095
Personally, I like
to tell stories.

570
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,897
Not in that kind of sense,

571
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:43,268
what I mean is I like to write
a story about these attacks.

572
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,204
You know, how does
the story start?

573
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,106
Why are they doing it,
what are they gonna do,

574
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,574
what are we gonna see,

575
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,076
and then, most importantly,
what's the denouement,

576
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,178
what's the fallout
for the organization?

577
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,481
Because not
everyone's technical,

578
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,016
not everyone's in a SOC.

579
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,085
These stories work
really well for the board

580
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,720
when they start
reading this story

581
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,922
and it starts feeling
real for them,

582
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,657
as if it's actually happening.

583
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,393
You can attach it to
some form of kill chain

584
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,195
or a variation thereof.

585
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,663
You may just care,

586
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,999
how are these guys getting
into my organization,

587
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,600
how are they gonna
move through it,

588
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,235
and what are they after and
how are they gonna get out?

589
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,437
It can be as simple as that.

590
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,572
Like I said, it
doesn't really matter.

591
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,206
It's about what works for you,

592
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,141
but most importantly,

593
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,376
what works for the audience

594
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,543
that you're trying
to tell the story to

595
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,245
around the threat actors.

596
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,714
So, where are we?

597
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,017
Potentially somewhere near
situational awareness?

598
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,419
I kind of got a perception
now of all the elements.

599
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,654
I spent six months

600
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,756
trying to find all the
data in my organization.

601
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,759
I've got a comprehension
of the current situation.

602
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,828
I know who's targeting me.

603
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,629
I know what's gonna affect
those types of attacks,

604
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,467
and I've got an idea
of how these attacks

605
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,835
are gonna actually play out.

606
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,574
Bit of a caveat, there's
three levels of maturity here.

607
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,609
Maturity one, perception,

608
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,379
reporting on what you think
before you've actually

609
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,381
completed your
intelligence methodologies,

610
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,983
until you've done
some murder boarding,

611
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:08,120
until you've run some devil's
advocate against all of this.

612
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,420
It's a pretty
dangerous place to be.

613
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,390
If you think you know
what threat actor

614
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,924
might be coming at you

615
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,494
and you think what assets
they might be going after,

616
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,129
therefore, you've put in a
particular set of defenses,

617
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,098
but you don't really know.

618
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,867
It's gonna be expensive
and dangerous.

619
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,036
Just doing everything
I've described,

620
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,540
documenting it,
having intelligence
methodologies around it,

621
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,943
that's a fantastic place to be.

622
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,246
If you've achieved
that, good for you.

623
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,680
And then, horizon-scanning.

624
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,417
Like I was saying, it's about
looking into the future.

625
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,985
Where is my organization going,

626
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,586
sorry, that's the third
time I've done that.

627
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,922
You'd think I'd learn by now.

628
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,524
Where's my organization going?

629
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,757
Are we moving into
a new territory,

630
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,427
are we launching a new product?

631
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,396
Are we building our
IT architecture in
a particular way?

632
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,799
All of these things,

633
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,367
what's gonna happen to
the threat environment

634
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,003
over the next one,
three, or five years?

635
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,670
Really important place to be,

636
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,972
aspirational, absolutely.

637
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,810
To appease those that

638
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,581
say, "But Rob, there's a
difference between battlespace,

639
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,484
"battlefield, and environment,"

640
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,952
you need to break this down.

641
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,289
If you operate in multiple
geographies and multiple areas,

642
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,991
you need to do IPCE
for each of those.

643
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,127
If you operate in different
industry verticals,

644
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,896
you need to do IPCE for
each of those verticals.

645
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,764
The threats you face
in North America

646
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,767
are very different to the
threats that will face you

647
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,337
against your payment systems
in Thailand or Australia

648
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,273
or South Africa or
definitely South America.

649
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,475
You need to break that down.

650
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,742
You can still pull
these together

651
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:41,413
for an operational-wide
view of the environment,

652
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,582
but having individual
pictures is critical.

653
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:47,219
You can really go down into
quite minute details for those.

654
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,353
But why?

655
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,588
What's the point?

656
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,991
SANS says it best,
as ever, absolutely.

657
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,460
"It needs to be part of
rehearsals, simulation,

658
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,729
"testing, and development now."

659
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,231
The funny thing is,

660
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,334
now was in 2001 when SANS
first wrote this paper.

661
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,769
Yeah, 16 years ago.

662
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,071
I can do math, quick math.

663
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,775
There's some really good
government and regulatory

664
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,844
environments where, effectively,

665
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,080
they call it other
things, but it's IPCE.

666
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,814
They're only a
couple of years old.

667
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,084
Why do we need to do it?

668
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,819
We need to take those
attack scenarios,

669
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,821
and you need to find
your favorite red team.

670
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,889
You know those red teams
that are highly certified,

671
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,391
very expensive,

672
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,660
use previously-seen SCVs
on their previous reports,

673
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,195
so they are good red teams,

674
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,898
they're not just pen testers
that say they do red teams.

675
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,634
You need to get them to
test out those scenarios.

676
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,402
Once they've tested
out those scenarios,

677
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,504
you're driving your
brilliance of your blue team,

678
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,372
because the red team is
gonna sit with your blue team

679
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,041
and show you what they did.

680
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,208
They're gonna work together

681
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,777
and they're gonna
enhance their capability

682
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,045
for instant response as well,

683
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,381
'cause they're
constantly practicing.

684
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,883
It's gonna create your
playbooks and your use cases,

685
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,151
and they're gonna get better

686
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,920
and they're gonna
play into the SOC.

687
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,322
It's gonna drive your
policy and hone your policy

688
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,690
and actually make
it more effective.

689
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,626
Most importantly, when
you're doing this stuff,

690
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,461
it's gonna help drive the
strategy a bit better,

691
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,030
but you're gonna
find some real good

692
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,831
tactical and operational wins

693
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,033
that's gonna drive your
road map in a direction

694
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,903
that's probably less
expensive, less time-consuming,

695
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,272
and effort is pushed
into the right areas.

696
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,841
But most importantly, from an
intelligence point of view,

697
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,811
your ICP, your intelligence
collection plan,

698
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,580
is driven by IPCE.

699
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,883
You know know where your
intelligence gaps are.

700
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,419
You know you don't
know where's my data.

701
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,588
You're not 100% sure on
particular threat actors

702
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,389
or current methodologies.

703
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,426
You don't really understand
what the business is doing.

704
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,395
You haven't really integrated
into HR, procurement,

705
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,897
or business strategy or to board

706
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,332
to find out what's their
aspirational place to be.

707
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,870
All of these gaps
will come out of your

708
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,540
IPCE and help drive your
intelligence requirements

709
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,776
and help drive your
intelligence collection plan.

710
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,011
Really good place to be.

711
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,580
Like I said, most of
you are probably doing

712
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,081
a form of IPCE already.

713
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,985
I've just put a name to it,

714
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,920
which has actually been
about for 50 years, but hey.

715
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,656
Questions, so, I just wanna say,

716
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,825
those are the three
main resources.

717
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,661
The SANS paper is fantastic.

718
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,931
The US Army and US
Marine Corps doctrine

719
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,901
is very good, very in-depth,
but it's 212 pages long.

720
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,204
As I said, I'm dyslexic,
I won't read that much,

721
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,905
so the SANS paper is best.

722
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,440
Carnegie Mellon,

723
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,377
they're mostly focused around
operational resiliency,

724
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,812
as that's effectively
why we're doing it.

725
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,447
Therefore, that's
why I put it up there

726
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,548
as a good resource.

727
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,617
Thank you all very much indeed.

728
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,620
(audience clapping)

729
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,491
(intense music)
