1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,140
let me just get what we were talking

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,650
here on this slide the idea that

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:12,320
actually the ratio between how much this

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:15,350
specific place I'm visiting

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,940
under the overall ratio of all the

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,550
things that's the number that matter

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,860
right so I'm gonna throw a slightly more

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,050
complicated equation here right the only

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,970
thing I'm talking about is that on the

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:30,080
on the bottom there it's the sum of all

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,460
da asses or all the registrar's or all

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,949
the different things so for each

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,660
different P P which is a pivoting point

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,710
everything this slide is telling you is

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,139
what I was told

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,030
telling you on the when we were the

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,190
other you had the other slide up with

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,170
the example so no need to be afraid of

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,780
this line I just want to have things

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,910
written down because it's if people want

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,829
to try to reproduce this is much more

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,790
precise than me just blabbing about and

23
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,790
and waving my arms
