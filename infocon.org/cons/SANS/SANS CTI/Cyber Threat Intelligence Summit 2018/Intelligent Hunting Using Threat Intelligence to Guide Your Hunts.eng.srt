1
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,847
- I'm going to talk to you
about using threat intelligence

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,882
to guide your hunts.

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,886
I think today's flow has
actually gone really well.

4
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,921
You're probably gonna hear a
lot of some of the concepts

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:25,392
that we just heard,
also mentioned here.

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,561
Hopefully that will lend
some credence to them.

7
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,497
All right, a little
bit of background,

8
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,432
I know Rick mentioned some.

9
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,268
Security technologist at sqrrl.

10
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,103
Yes, this slide is
about a week old so that

11
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,138
has changed since.

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,143
I also, at night, I run
Malformity Labs and yes,

13
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,781
you made deduce from the
two logos that the walls

14
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,748
of my office are
indeed orange and gray.

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,488
Little bit of background
of why I chose this talk.

16
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,059
Laying in bed one night,
thinking about really

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,494
what has changed, at
least in the aspects of

18
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,830
the industry that I
have been exposed to

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,368
over the just under a decade
that I've been doing it.

20
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,304
So starting as an intern
for Usizo, helping build

21
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,575
out the security program
moving to forensics and

22
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,745
incident response over
to intel, now working for

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,282
a product team that to
hopefully design a product

24
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,584
useful for those practitioners.

25
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,922
You look at then and
when I first started,

26
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,894
largely prevention
focused so as long as

27
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,496
we don't let those bad guys in

28
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,131
we're good to go, game over.

29
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,570
In order to do that
we're gonna add those new

30
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,839
firewall rules, make
sure everything's updated

31
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,373
and patch our systems.

32
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,943
Of course, that last one
still provides difficulty

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,344
for a lot of organizations.

34
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,148
And at the time, if
you asked anybody about

35
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,984
threat intelligence,
unless they were government

36
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,320
or very closely
related to government,

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,288
probably didn't have any handle
on what that actually meant.

38
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,292
Fast forward to today.

39
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,096
I think most organizations
would agree that

40
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,398
prevention detection and
response all have their

41
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,001
place in an information
security program.

42
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,572
Threat intelligence,
we have prevalent data,

43
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,207
probably more important
than data, we have

44
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,676
defined processes to
help take this to your

45
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,512
organization, things
like this conference,

46
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,782
who I think this morning
they mentioned, six years.

47
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:33,553
However, we take the third
point, what are we still

48
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,522
doing on the rule front, right?

49
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:40,527
We're still throwing in new
rules, just a lot more places,

50
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:41,894
a lot more boxes.

51
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,734
We've seen large strides
in the programs themselves

52
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:52,172
but we haven't seen a
whole lot of change in how

53
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:57,076
rules are used within
our defensive posture

54
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:01,680
in order to move up
the pyramid of pain,

55
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,615
as Rick mentioned.

56
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,386
I am not saying rules are bad.

57
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,588
I absolutely believe
rules have their place.

58
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,958
Probably a necessary evil.

59
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,993
I think right now as many
of the prior presenters

60
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,864
have eluded to, She-Learning
is trying to encroach

61
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,267
on this but I don't think
we're doing it correctly.

62
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,003
A lot of people are looking
for a magic easy button

63
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,672
I can deploy this thing
that learns all this stuff

64
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,342
and outputs only the bad things.

65
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,879
Going from current posture
to that, I don't think

66
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,079
is very realistic.

67
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,750
What does that mean?

68
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,886
Alert fatigue is very real.

69
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,422
I'm sure many of you are
very familiar with this

70
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,691
problem, especially
if you're in a SOC

71
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,693
or active detective role.

72
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,764
This is one of the reasons.

73
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:56,035
So everything, traditionally

74
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,503
when we started with the

75
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,606
intel focus I know many
folks mentioned already today

76
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,176
as well, that this conference
is very indicator focused.

77
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,379
A lot of organizations are
still indicator focused

78
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,448
in their detection, so
a new report comes out,

79
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,652
if they have an internal team,
a new report is generated.

80
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,921
What are the consumables
from that report?

81
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,055
First thing that everybody
does is grabs that

82
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,859
appendix, depending on the
source, scrapes the pdf,

83
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,330
puts all the
indicators into rules

84
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,632
into all of their devices.

85
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,837
What else does that mean?

86
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,840
Every new device, as I
eluded to, every new box

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,907
that's purchased,
they're all producing

88
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,177
an alert stream.

89
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,613
Problem with that, you're
just contributing to the

90
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,081
alert fatigue.

91
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,983
So if you put that detection
in five places, you get

92
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,152
five alerts, that's
not really helping.

93
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,622
So what do we want to do?

94
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,725
We want to move off
those lower levels of the

95
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,194
Pyramid of Pain,
we want to move up.

96
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,698
Now I know it seems very easy
to say, not quite so easy

97
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,433
to put into practice.

98
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:05,405
Experience, man-power, tooling,

99
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,042
maybe prevent an organization,
any combination of the three,

100
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,376
from working towards this goal.

101
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,782
In order to do that
we have a couple of

102
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,683
pieces here that
we're gonna talk about

103
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,686
that should really
play well together.

104
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:23,423
The first one you saw this
morning, the intelligence cycle.

105
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,025
The second is the
threat hunting loop.

106
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,960
I'm sure both have been
discussed in length here

107
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,996
in prior years.

108
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,033
But the reason these
should work together

109
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,669
what we're gonna talk
about is using the output

110
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,707
from your intelligence
cycle to guide the

111
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,607
loop on the right.

112
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,079
Your products coming
out of that cycle should

113
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,283
feed organizationally
relevant hypotheses done for.

114
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,484
That's really the key part.

115
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,620
So any intel you're
producing or purchasing

116
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,756
should be relevant
to your organization.

117
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,325
We're gonna hunt for those

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,662
and keep in mind that when
we're hunting, there's kind

119
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,229
of two major goals.

120
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,600
The first, you want to
send data back to that

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,601
intelligence cycle.

122
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,637
You're intel folks want to
know if you found anything,

123
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,473
they want to know if you
found anything else that

124
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,776
they didn't know about,
they want to know if you

125
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:20,413
got a lot of false positives,
if what you did find

126
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,750
was related to the activity

127
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,818
that they initially reported on.

128
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,488
Those are all great
feedback pieces for them

129
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,889
to continue that cycle.

130
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,793
The second piece we
want to do is implement

131
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,129
detective measures
on our network.

132
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,700
There's some discussion
back and forth about

133
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,869
whether or not hunting
can be automated.

134
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,072
I don't think it's, there's
certain levels of that.

135
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,309
I don't want to have
to repeat the same hunt

136
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,211
over and over manually.

137
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:56,449
If I conduct a hunt,
confirm it was useful,

138
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,486
had outcomes that were
relative and built my

139
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,222
security program, I
would like to be able to

140
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:08,060
implement the same hunt as a
repeatable detective measure.

141
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,562
I don't want to have to
run that, otherwise it's

142
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,999
unmanageable and you can't
continue building a library

143
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,700
of hunts that you
have to run manually.

144
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,402
You will run out of time,
there are not enough people.

145
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,541
So what does this
process look like?

146
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,443
This is a hypothetical
example that I pulled

147
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,478
from a secure list article.

148
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,346
For the purposes of this
we're gonna say that

149
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,116
it was from an
internal investigation.

150
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,021
I always suggest folks
start with internal sources

151
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,090
before they go external
because they're free,

152
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,258
you already have them and
they are automatically

153
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,828
relevant to your organization.

154
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,264
So in this hypothetical
example, user downloads an

155
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,500
attachment from their
personal email account,

156
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,137
goes through a series of
downloaders, ends with a

157
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,640
dropper that finally
delivers a payload which

158
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,276
takes some post-base
actions here and finally

159
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,878
communicates out to a C2.

160
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,915
So right now what
do most people do?

161
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,219
Everybody gets everything
on the left, all of your

162
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,521
standard indicators.

163
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,857
Low bottom three
levels on the pyramid.

164
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,261
The advanced folks get
the ones on the right,

165
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,332
they move up one level, or
some combination thereof,

166
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:24,036
but we are still annoying
at best for the adversary.

167
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,975
We really want to change
that and try to move

168
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,710
to challenging or tough.

169
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,113
The end question is
is that effective?

170
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,215
With everything that
happens currently,

171
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,018
are we taking a
worthwhile step forward?

172
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,723
How do we move to actually
move up the pyramid?

173
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,593
I'm gonna propose that
we want to generalize

174
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,796
all of those indicators
that we just had.

175
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,165
Right now each one of
those was atomic in nature,

176
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,035
a specific value, and then
we want to hunt for them.

177
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,272
This is what that
might look like.

178
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,775
We have all the atomic
ones on the left,

179
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,545
the new potential generalized
categories on the right.

180
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,948
For instance, take the
top one, IPs and Domains,

181
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,853
most every malware beacons,
or a large majority.

182
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:18,391
If we can change to
beaconing detection as a

183
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,094
class of detection
that is more effective

184
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:28,100
on a front of
detecting maliciousness

185
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,771
but anybody that has
tried to implement

186
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,740
a beaconing detector,
you're going to get

187
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,208
a lot of false positives.

188
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,212
Let's stick to the same
thought here with all

189
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,314
the ones on the right.

190
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,884
Given what I just said,
some of you may be saying

191
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,285
well, all right, if I'm
getting a bunch of false

192
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,687
positives, what's the point?

193
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,656
Isn't that just going
to give me more alerts?

194
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,592
Yes, if you implemented
every one of those

195
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,961
individually, you're
absolutely gonna experience

196
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,195
alert fatigue. ú

197
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,663
That's not what I'm
gonna suggest for you.

198
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,299
I don't want to look at every
one of those on their own.

199
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,535
I want to start
building higher-order

200
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,738
groupings and take those
into account instead

201
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,207
of individual atomic detections.

202
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,445
So if I have those,
that's what I want to do.

203
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,213
What's next?

204
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,118
Activity groups are a
concept, this definition is

205
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,555
from independent guests
actually presented this

206
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,657
four years ago at
this conference here.

207
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,629
I'm gonna talk about
the diamond model.

208
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,963
Diamond model's fantastic.

209
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,933
I highly recommend if
anybody's interested they check

210
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,301
out that presentation.

211
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,736
They have it in the archives.

212
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,107
He also has some examples
of using activity groups

213
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,976
for other contexts,
not just alerts

214
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,646
as well as developing some.

215
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:53,085
If we take all of our
decomposed actions

216
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,755
with this in mind, I
want to start to form

217
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,289
activity groups.

218
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,324
So we'll swing back
to our example.

219
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,462
From our example we have
two groups that we formed.

220
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,398
So we have the first group
which would essentially

221
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:10,403
be the generalized activity
from the downloader stages

222
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,473
and we have the second
group which is the

223
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,511
generalized activity
from the actual payload.

224
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,215
Now if you take these
in whole, they represent

225
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,352
a behavior that an
adversary is using,

226
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,623
specifically a tool,
so we're moving up.

227
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:35,428
In order to bypass
these it's gonna be

228
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,929
a little bit more challenging.

229
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,099
Quick review of that process.

230
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,501
We had the intelligence
inputs that

231
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,136
end up with your hunting.

232
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,271
Depending on your organization,

233
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,175
your intel folks may
be doing the hunting,

234
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,410
SOC may be doing the hunting.

235
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,344
Some of these may
fluctuate a little bit

236
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,348
like this first pass,
several folks have

237
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:00,519
mentioned today that there's
a desire to put things out

238
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,723
spur discussion, hopefully
see it expanded on

239
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,156
as we go forward.

240
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,760
So in many cases, for instance,
decomposing the actions of

241
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,997
the malicious
behavior may be a new

242
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,300
output of your intel team.

243
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,534
They're already looking
at it, they're doing the

244
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,336
analysis, why not
have them group it.

245
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,440
You want to take those
and form our hypotheses

246
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,175
and then actually go hunt.

247
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,278
Now, one thing that
we really want to do

248
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,980
while we're still
hunting is pay attention

249
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,751
for other characteristics
that we find

250
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,521
we didn't have in our
original groupings.

251
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,890
So we work to build
out a library.

252
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,059
One of those, for
instance, this would be

253
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,461
enriching actions,
in previous slides,

254
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,931
not every file download
is malicious, obviously,

255
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,567
however, maybe when
we're doing our hunts we

256
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:53,205
notice that near every
file download that

257
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,075
taught you a never
before observed domain

258
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,576
was malicious.

259
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,577
So we have another
characteristic there that we

260
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,079
can pull out.

261
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,714
We don't want to group
them now, we want to keep

262
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,115
it separate, keep everything

263
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,050
properly decomposed.

264
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,689
After we enrich those, we
start to form groupings

265
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,724
of the relevant ones
that we pulled out.

266
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,563
So that example, right,
uses known behavior.

267
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,799
We had a report that
said this is what occurs

268
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,535
and we used that
to form our groups.

269
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:27,139
But as a hunt team,
part of our goal is to

270
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,142
uncover unknown activity groups.

271
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,444
We didn't have a
prior report on this

272
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,679
but we found it anyway.

273
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,116
How might we be able to
do that with this method?

274
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,521
So all of our decomposed
actions, I would assign

275
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,955
metadata to them.

276
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,025
These are common examples
that many of you are

277
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,425
probably familiar with.

278
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,894
It's gonna change for
every organization,

279
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,696
what works, what
they can implement,

280
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,701
but these are a couple
that we're gonna go over.

281
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,703
We revisit our activity
group number one.

282
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,474
We have the actual specific
actions on the left

283
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,511
and their classification
for, in this case,

284
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,213
the killchain, on the right.

285
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,582
What you see here is
if we break those down,

286
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,884
we get three exploitation
actions, two C2 actions

287
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,953
and one installation action.

288
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,021
So what I'm gonna do, I'm
gonna form an activity

289
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,724
group that is two exploitation
actions, two C2 actions,

290
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,793
and one installation.

291
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,729
I cut out one of the
exploitation actions.

292
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,698
The reason I did that is
it gives us flexibility

293
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,433
so with that new
requirement it's still gonna

294
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,102
detect this but it's
also gonna detect if

295
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,605
the actor decides to
cut out one of their

296
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,639
downloader stages.

297
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,548
Example with mitre attack
from our second grouping.

298
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,717
Now attack is a little
bit trickier depending

299
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,619
on what's in your grouping.

300
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,521
Attack focuses pre-exploit
for their actions.

301
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,092
In this case we encounter
that with the first

302
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,761
step there of
recent compile time

303
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,997
characteristic of potentially
malicious binaries

304
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,500
and we were lucky
enough, though, so miter

305
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,770
more recently released
pre-attack, which is

306
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,473
prior to the exploit
phase, and in that case

307
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,877
they had create custom
payloads as one of the steps,

308
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,378
which is where that falls.

309
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,780
So you can see here we may
create an activity group

310
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,584
that involves those
four attack categories.

311
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,620
In both cases, what that
allows you to do, is use

312
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,991
that characterization of
the action for detection.

313
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,295
We're not tied to
a specific action.

314
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,498
An actor can sub out
any action within that

315
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,268
particular phase
and potentially your

316
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,770
detection would still work.

317
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,907
All right, so, before
we talked about creating

318
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,842
more alerts if they're
all individual,

319
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,412
and the elephant now,

320
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,148
some of you may be
saying, hey Keith, you're

321
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,417
eight or so years
behind the times,

322
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,952
these are just
correlation rules,

323
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,087
no big deal, can already do it.

324
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,290
All right, yes, basic level,
you are correlating things.

325
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,728
Question, though, how
many organizations have

326
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:07,199
a defined process
to take their intel,

327
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,635
whether internal or
external, or data or

328
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,603
information that they
gather elsewhere,

329
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,441
analyze it, pull out
specific groups, and

330
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,611
implement specific
detections, both at a

331
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:24,616
tactical and higher
level, as part of that.

332
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,385
You may have a
technical capability for

333
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,886
correlation rules but
how many people are

334
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,155
making maximized use of it?

335
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,025
Is that operational currently?

336
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,829
This is really
just the beginning.

337
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,632
This example produced
shortly after

338
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,802
notifications for this
conference went out.

339
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,437
I'm sure many of you
are familiar with

340
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,774
Jack's fantastic work on
Twitter and on his blog,

341
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,777
refers to this process as
dynamic signature chaining

342
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,547
which, I think, is a
very good description of

343
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:59,018
what you're doing when you
form an activity group.

344
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,589
Of course, I joked about
encroaching on my talk here,

345
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,259
and Rich aptly and 100%
correctly pointed out that

346
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,295
this is by no means a
soft science or defined

347
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,931
100% process and there's
plenty of room for

348
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,001
multiple folks to
do some research.

349
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,938
A couple of those areas
that would be fantastic.

350
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,241
The example I provided,
it's host based,

351
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,444
it's on one host, for any
that occurs it's on one box.

352
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,012
How much more effective
can we be if we can

353
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:30,549
take activity groups
across multiple boxes

354
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,383
and link them?

355
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,219
How do we do that?

356
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,855
What other considerations
do we have?

357
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,257
Does there have to be
a direct connection

358
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,892
between those two hosts
or maybe just 'cause

359
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,894
they talk to each
other, is that enough?

360
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,563
How do we rank them?

361
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,132
Can we account for which
ones are more important?

362
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,835
So whether that's more
metadata that we insert

363
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,405
which is based on confidence
level or threat level,

364
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,976
if we can do that
automatically or automagically,

365
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,946
as I prefer, with
prevalence on the network.

366
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,314
Maybe if it happens
more does that mean it's

367
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,217
less likely to be bad?

368
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,552
Maybe, maybe not.

369
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,322
Probably most importantly,
systems and methods

370
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,889
for actually implementing this.

371
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,595
On that front, during
research for this talk,

372
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,297
I came across Jordan's
blog, which is actually

373
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,131
really good.

374
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,868
Read the first one and
while still drafting the

375
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,570
talk the second one came
out and in the second

376
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,108
one he shows an
example of detecting

377
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,078
mimikatz with elastalert which
is an alerting framework for

378
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,947
elasticsearch and

379
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,318
in that he uses five

380
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,254
detections and creates a
rule that says if these

381
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,991
five fire within a
second of each other,

382
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,895
then surface one rule that
encompasses all of those.

383
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,030
That is effectively
an implementation

384
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,197
of what I'm describing.

385
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,202
As luck would have it,
in the process of that,

386
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:01,240
Roberto dropped HELK, which
is a hunting distribution

387
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,577
of ELK, and I noticed on
that roadmap there was

388
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:10,249
elastalert, so it looks
like HELK may become a

389
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,352
good open-source
option for beginning to

390
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,420
implement this in practice.

391
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,590
And then lastly, Keith
Casey and the rest of the

392
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,092
Carbon Black team really
put out a lot of great

393
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,363
content on alert suppression,
alerting at scale,

394
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,331
dealing with false positives,
that sort of thing,

395
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,100
so they're always
good to monitor.

396
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,671
So the important part,

397
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,341
that's great, sounds
good, I can't do that

398
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,409
fully operationally right now.

399
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,479
What can I do instead?

400
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,348
First thing you want
to do is break down

401
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,983
your intel sources.

402
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:49,053
Again, internal, external,
free, paid, whatever,

403
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,393
every long form source
should have actions that

404
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,497
you can pull out and activity
groups that you can create.

405
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,033
If it doesn't, you might
want to ask yourself

406
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,669
if it's actually an intel
source or a data source.

407
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,307
Then you want to hunt
for those groups.

408
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,708
You pulled the actions out.

409
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,413
In theory they're relevant
for your organization,

410
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,215
you're gonna go see
if you can find any

411
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,116
currently, right
now, on your network.

412
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,522
While you're doing that
you're going to find

413
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,657
data and detection gaps.

414
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,460
If you don't, please come
tell me where you work

415
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,529
and I will ask you if
you have any jobs open.

416
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,499
That is gonna happen
and that is actually

417
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,768
really good, especially
if you've been documenting

418
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,006
your process
because now you have

419
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:45,978
specific TTPs tied to
specific concrete actions,

420
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,081
you cannot detect them.

421
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,484
In some cases they're
tied to defined actors,

422
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:57,255
I'll say known defined actors,
but you can't see them.

423
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,692
In aggregate, that is
really strong backing

424
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,929
to say I need
tooling X or I need

425
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,634
four people to do Y and
you can say this is why,

426
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,504
because I can't see
these actors taking out

427
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,307
these actions against us.

428
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,309
It's very relevant
to your organization.

429
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,680
Then you want to start
categorizing those detections.

430
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,717
As you hunt, confirm they're
valid, build them out,

431
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,519
you're gonna start
building your library.

432
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,987
If you start categorizing
these, you want to think

433
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,790
about what's useful
for organization,

434
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,561
detection, current use,
future use, tying them

435
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,031
to known internal
incidents can be useful for

436
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:43,201
tracking, trend
tracking down the road,

437
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,437
particularly as was mentioned
earlier, you're gonna

438
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,540
do your own internal
data breach report,

439
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,576
very useful to build out.

440
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,378
You may not be able to
operationalize in an

441
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,281
automated fashion currently
but you can at least

442
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,752
use them to hunt
with and to work on

443
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,325
categorizing and defining
your current gaps.

444
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,095
And with that--

445
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,364
(clapping)
