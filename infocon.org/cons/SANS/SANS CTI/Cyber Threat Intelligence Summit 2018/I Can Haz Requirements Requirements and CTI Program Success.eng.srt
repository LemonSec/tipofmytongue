1
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,413
(applause)

2
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,748
- Just a little
bit about myself.

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,849
I'm a career intelligence
professional.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,153
I spent eight or so years
active duty in the US Navy

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,622
as an enlisted
intelligence specialist.

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,257
The first part of
my career there,

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,927
I was a imagery
analyst, much like Rick,

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,929
focusing on maritime
security operations,

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,898
counter piracy, and
humanitarian assistance

10
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,266
disaster relief efforts.

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,668
After that I was
fortunate enough

12
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,704
to go to the big
black box on route 32,

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,406
the NSA and Cyber Command.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,243
At Cyber Command, I fulfilled
a couple different roles.

15
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,911
One was providing that
sort of indications

16
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:48,381
and warning analysis for
senior Cyber Command leadership

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,551
and I was able to be
part of one of the new

18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,986
cyber national
mission force teams

19
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,288
which was an exciting
time to be in.

20
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,855
And then on the NSA
side, I can't talk

21
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,892
about that because reasons.

22
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,028
After I left government
service in 2015,

23
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,164
I joined United Health
Group as part of their

24
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,132
cyber intelligence
services team.

25
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,500
There I was more
focused on providing

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,968
that strategic and
operational level

27
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,038
intelligence support for
senior business leaders

28
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,808
and cyber defense organizations
within the company.

29
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,010
And as of last July
I joined McAfee,

30
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,745
originally part of
the labs organization

31
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,280
and then now advanced
grant research

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,315
where I'm a security
researcher focusing

33
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,917
on Russian APT groups.

34
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,324
And so, much like
Luke tells Rayon Octo

35
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,426
in the last Jedi that
it's time for the Jedi

36
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,228
to end so too is the
time for the lack of

37
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,330
intelligence
requirements to end.

38
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,365
Just in my combined
experience in both

39
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,204
public and private sectors,
we place a lot of emphasis

40
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,639
on the collection, the
cool whiz-bang analysis,

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,410
and the end deliverable,
what we're providing

42
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,946
to those decision-makers,
but we don't place

43
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,782
a lot of stock or cycles
devoted to generating

44
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,384
and managing the
requirements process

45
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,420
at the onset of the
intelligence cycle.

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,822
And while it's all fine
and dandy that we do

47
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,592
all this really interesting
and insightful work,

48
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,694
if we're not aligning
those analytic efforts

49
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,630
to pre-existing
requirements, we're sort of

50
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,465
diminishing the
value added that we

51
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,833
provide to an organization.

52
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,005
And so to get to
the brass tacks,

53
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,340
why do we need them
in the first place?

54
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,108
They help us, as
intelligence professionals,

55
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,245
to answer critical questions
our customers have,

56
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:30,250
that they have on those
sort of information issues.

57
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,585
We all have our
little pet interests,

58
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,887
our side projects,
that we care deeply

59
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,355
and passionate about.

60
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,789
Sometimes they align with
what we're working on

61
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,191
in our nine-to-five
capacity but without that

62
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:44,130
sort of structured
planning in requirements

63
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,565
generation at the
onset the intelligence

64
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,102
production cycle
you start licking an

65
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,971
ice cream cone as Rob
likes to say sometimes

66
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,475
and intelligence that
doesn't meet a specified need

67
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,644
only has so much value.

68
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,482
Intelligence
requirements can help

69
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,683
you do a variety
different things.

70
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,718
They can help you scope
the end deliverable,

71
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,154
what you're producing,
through your analytic efforts.

72
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,256
They can help you
prioritize your collection

73
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,091
capabilities, where
your postured to collect

74
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,794
the type of data that
you need access to

75
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,796
in order to fulfill
those pre-existing

76
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,832
intelligence
requirements to help you

77
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,601
identify gaps in data sources.

78
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,637
For example say you
are being charted

79
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,308
to focus on X thing
but your access

80
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,777
to that data is
limited so doing that

81
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,111
sort of gap analysis
can help you

82
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,914
mitigate those
deficiencies and what

83
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,281
your visibility
is into the threat

84
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,586
environment help
overcome those gaps.

85
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,853
And then ultimately
like anything that we do

86
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,855
in this business,
it's there to help us

87
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,224
get ahead of the adversary.

88
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,961
And so for those
of you who aren't

89
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,329
familiar with this
graphic, it's the

90
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,431
intelligence cycle and
those of you who are

91
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,999
familiar with it I'm
sorry you have to see

92
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,602
yet another graphic of
the intelligence cycle.

93
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:59,038
And just having this up
there just kind of puts

94
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,540
a pin on my point that
I'm trying to make,

95
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,075
is that without that
critical planning

96
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,875
and requirements
section at the onset

97
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:08,047
of the intelligence cycle
at large we can't expect

98
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,216
to do the rest of the
cycle effectively.

99
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,485
It hinders our
ability to prioritize

100
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,054
and have efficient
collection, being able

101
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,623
to exploit and analyze
that data in a timely

102
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,591
and efficient manner,
and then ultimately

103
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,860
getting that finished
intelligence work

104
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,662
to the decision-makers
when they need it,

105
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,530
how they need it,
where they need it.

106
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:32,105
And so Tabara told advice
from our friend Boromir,

107
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,907
once and one does not simply
make requirements alone.

108
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,176
It's a team sport
without that feedback

109
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,145
from who we're engaging
with, from either

110
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,281
the senior executives
within the organization,

111
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,584
your sister teams in the
trenches along with you

112
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,918
in the network fight.

113
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,920
It's got to be done
together and intend

114
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,256
and make sure we're
aligning our intelligence

115
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,625
production efforts with
legitimate business

116
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,527
and operational needs.

117
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,898
So, another age-old question.

118
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,033
How can you haz them?

119
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,837
First, we won't
identify everyone

120
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,205
with the L we could
possibly think of who

121
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,407
would benefit from
the intelligence work

122
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,676
that we're doing.

123
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,513
And then so for the
more technical folks,

124
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,282
taking a look at the red
team, your hacker man's,

125
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,652
your security operations
center, team members,

126
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,888
your brothers and sisters
over on the incident

127
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,022
response or digital
forensics folks,

128
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,525
and if your organization
supports this

129
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,359
sort of function,
brain reputation.

130
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,164
And then we look on Hi
to the Mr. Moneybags

131
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,134
within the group, those
who live in the c-suite,

132
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,671
CEO, COs, CSO and
the like, the bosses

133
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,007
that they report to,
board of directors,

134
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,408
those who drive
large or big picture

135
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,712
business planning
strategic vision for

136
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,815
the organization, procurement,
things of that nature.

137
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,918
Another little tidbit that
it's a view sometimes,

138
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,221
at least in my
experiences, if you're

139
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,990
in a giant fortune 10,
20, 50 organization

140
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,061
you may be surprised
that people don't know

141
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,263
you exist as a team
so sometimes it's best

142
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,700
to when in doubt reach out.

143
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,969
You'd be surprised
how many previously

144
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,706
unknown customers that
you have within the

145
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,441
organization who
want to work with you

146
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,044
if you just make
contact with them.

147
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,317
Okay, so now that we
talked about the why,

148
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,685
let's talk about the what.

149
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,620
What makes an
intelligence requirement?

150
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,289
And I know we all
just love our overly

151
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,426
verbose jargon laid and
government definitions

152
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,628
so I will just make
like Robert Downey Jr.

153
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,631
for a second and let
you guys read that.

154
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,905
Okay, now that we got
the jargon out of the way

155
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,409
let's get down to the
root of it and let's talk

156
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,878
about what makes a good
intelligence requirement.

157
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,849
A good intelligence requirement
consists of four things.

158
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,252
The one is timeliness.

159
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,753
And our British
friends and their joint

160
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,255
military doctrine have
a quote that really

161
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,891
resonated with me that said
intelligence that is late

162
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,293
is as good as ignorance.

163
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,263
If you aren't able
to deliver the right

164
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,664
kind of intelligence
in a timely manner

165
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,234
to meet that
decision-making cycle

166
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,469
you're not providing
the value-added

167
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,140
that you're there to provide.

168
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,010
Furthermore, a good
intelligence requirement

169
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,578
aids one decision point.

170
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,914
It asks one specific
question and it focuses

171
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,082
on one specific activity,
event, or thing.

172
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,719
It's not uncommon to
see these large overly

173
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,555
verbose intelligence
requirements that's

174
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,724
kind of look like Frankenstein
at the end of them.

175
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,526
And if you generate
your requirements

176
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,295
that look like that
don't be surprised

177
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,564
if you get this weird
puzzled look on your CSOs

178
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,799
face saying what did
you just give me.

179
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,138
And now just for a little
segway and I'll pause

180
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,239
for my terrible pun.

181
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,010
So, in the
decision-making process

182
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,712
that we are here to
support as intelligence

183
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,548
professionals, we
take a lot of stock

184
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:06,085
in helping block something,
procure something,

185
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,555
change a business policy
directive, what-have-you,

186
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,657
but something that
is often overlooked

187
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,060
is that an equally valid
decision in that process

188
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,096
is that of inaction,
the conscious decision

189
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,065
on the part of a
decision-maker to choose

190
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,800
not to do something
as an equally valid

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,369
decision point that
we have to consider

192
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,204
and what we're trying
to inform them.

193
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,842
Okay, so where do you start?

194
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,344
I mean we could all
just be like SpongeBob

195
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,313
and use your imagination
but that's not useful.

196
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,616
So, we could also
be like Solid Snake

197
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,985
when he's interrogating
a guard on a tanker

198
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,053
and that's the six
basic questions of who,

199
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,621
what, when, where, why, and how.

200
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,591
So, for example who
would want to attack me?

201
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,994
What do I have that
the adversary wants?

202
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,096
What are there.

203
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,332
Why would an attacker
come after my network?

204
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,401
They may seem like
simple requirements

205
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,436
on the onset but asking
those short specific

206
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:03,376
questions based off those
common question starters

207
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,345
can help you really
drive home to a clear,

208
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,848
concise, and succinct
intelligence requirement.

209
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,353
And I promise I didn't
steal this from you Rick

210
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,921
but there's always more.

211
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,992
I know we throw around
threat modeling, attack

212
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,763
surface, and the like
and I'm probably sure

213
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,197
someone takes a shot
every time they hear

214
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,700
that phrase now but
if you haven't done it

215
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,303
be like Arnold
Schwarzenegger and do it.

216
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,240
It'll help you derive
a lot of quick,

217
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,910
immediately relevant,
organizational specific

218
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,344
intelligence requirements
that can help

219
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,348
guide your intelligence
analytic efforts.

220
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,522
Take a look at what your
industry or vertical looks like.

221
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,593
No industry necessarily has
the same threat profile.

222
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,661
Say if you're in the
industrial control systems

223
00:09:55,661 --> 00:10:00,366
or energy production
sector those threat groups

224
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,501
aren't necessarily going
to be the same ones that

225
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,271
are in retail
commerce and the like.

226
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,573
So, being able just
to strip away the rest

227
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,643
of the marketplace so
to speak, look at what's

228
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,778
specific to your
vertical can help align

229
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,948
your intelligence
priorities and drill down

230
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,617
into the specifics
that are immediately

231
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,520
industrial relevant
and along with your

232
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,389
industry and organization.

233
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,262
And to kind of go back
to the threat model

234
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,465
and attack surface
aspect, the supply chain

235
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,869
always introduces
either known or unknown

236
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,604
risks to your organization.

237
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,140
So, being able to identify
as much as you can

238
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,141
because I know some
organizations are massive

239
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,543
behemoths and it's
not always possible

240
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,279
but to the best extent
that you can look

241
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,616
for potential weaknesses
either organizationally,

242
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,052
network-ly, operationally
that could invite

243
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,589
an attacker into your
network and sort of gauge

244
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,359
intelligence requirements
to focus more on how

245
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,062
does that sort of external
either outsourcing,

246
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,932
collaboration, or
operational sync-ness

247
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,269
with your vendors or
downstream suppliers

248
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,506
or what have you, how that can
affect your threat profile.

249
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,110
So, for everyone who grew
up in the 80s and 90s,

250
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,613
we all loved asking where in
the world is Carmen Sandiego?

251
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,049
So, why not ask yourselves
that from a threat

252
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,284
intelligence perspective
when generating requirements

253
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,987
and look at where you are
in the world geographically?

254
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,524
Depending on where
you are in the world,

255
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,627
you'll see X category
of threat groups

256
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,430
whereas if you're in
Y part of the world,

257
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,198
you'll see a completely
different one.

258
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,598
So, it doesn't make
sense if you're living

259
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,402
in region Y to focus
on exclusively the ones

260
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,037
that are in region X.

261
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,277
Okay, so crown jewel analysis
is always beneficial.

262
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,447
If you can take stock
of what you have

263
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,015
that an adversary
would want to penetrate

264
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,184
your network for it
will help you drive

265
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,188
a lot of intelligence
production regarding

266
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,157
adversary motivations,
intent, and help put

267
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,093
into context the sort
of activity that you're

268
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,327
seeing in the network.

269
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,996
So, for example,
you're in finance.

270
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,798
Do they want your money?

271
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,233
If you're in legal,
do you have privileged

272
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,636
information that someone
may want to steal

273
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:21,006
for some nefarious
purposes or do you have

274
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,343
something new for micro
processes that another

275
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,978
advanced country would
like to bridge the gap

276
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,415
and steal from you
to help implement

277
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,516
that in their country?

278
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,688
And so the too long
didn't read version

279
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,023
of all this is that
requirements or those enduring

280
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,660
questions that consumers of
intelligence need answers on.

281
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,333
Okay, so now that
we've talked about

282
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,336
those pre-existing, long-term,
enduring requirements,

283
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,037
let's have a scenario.

284
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,607
So, much like Rick
described earlier,

285
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,709
it's 5 o'clock on a Friday,
you're getting ready

286
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,478
to roll out after a long
arduous week of network

287
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,681
defense but as you know
the Friday news DEP

288
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,184
invariably happens.

289
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,853
Something happens, you get
10 different phone calls

290
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,387
at the same time from
senior leadership

291
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,357
with their hair on fire
and saying what is this?

292
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,458
Why didn't you tell me about it?

293
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,892
Why didn't I know about it?

294
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,827
What can I do?

295
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,996
Please get my hair off fire!

296
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,031
So, that's the common
occurrence within our industry

297
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,901
and I'm sure every single
one of you can count

298
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,669
numerous times on your
hands how many times

299
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,037
that has happened to you.

300
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,606
So, what do you do with that?

301
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,241
And that's the RFI process.

302
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,345
So, the RFI, or the
request for information,

303
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,781
process it can help
threat intelligence teams

304
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,983
manage those sort
of ad hoc drive by

305
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,853
at five o'clock tasker's
that aren't previously

306
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,022
met by those pre-existing
requirements that
shoot outlined.

307
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,529
Without one, you can
be like Buzz Light year

308
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,866
and just be inundated
with requests that you

309
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,703
aren't sure how to
meet them, when do you

310
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:01,906
need them done by, and
you just sort of get

311
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,609
sidetracked with all
these things coming in

312
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,078
that you aren't able
to always meet your

313
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,947
pre-existing production
requirements and these

314
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,481
ad hoc tasks fees that come in.

315
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,889
An important note here
is that when you're

316
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,958
generating these or
when you're responding

317
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,760
to these RFI's, work
with the customer

318
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,396
who is requesting them
even if they're senior

319
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,699
leadership outside of
your security organization

320
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,233
or business unit.

321
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,003
They may not necessarily
have the conceptual

322
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,571
frame of mind about
what intelligence is.

323
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,406
They just maybe know
that they have a thing

324
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,775
that does a thing and
you can answer the thing.

325
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,247
And so they may ask you
something that's not clear.

326
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,850
You're not sure what
they want or how it looks

327
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,686
like on what they
want to get back.

328
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:51,257
So, it's important to
at least to start that

329
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,126
conversation with massaging
that initial request,

330
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,963
trim it down to the bare
essentials to get to the root

331
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,165
of the question that
they need an answer to.

332
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,272
And then so from here
you can help them talk,

333
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,043
ask them like what
explicitly do they need,

334
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,045
what's the key intelligence
question that you're

335
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:17,483
trying to answer,
when do they need it?

336
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,352
We all know that
sometimes you're expected

337
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,655
to have the answer five
minutes ago or last week

338
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,790
but if you can help
establish a periodicity

339
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,827
afterwards that you can help
manage that expectation.

340
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,564
If I have six hours, I can
deliver this type of product.

341
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,300
If I have a day, I can do this.

342
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,168
If I have a week, I
can give you this.

343
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,671
So, it kind of goes back
to expectations management

344
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,408
and customer relations at
least from an intelligence

345
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,711
perspective as to how
to meet those emerging

346
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,614
intelligence needs in a
timely efficient manner

347
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,216
that ultimately answers the
question that they have.

348
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,220
Format, that could
be the dreaded email.

349
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,456
You can have a PowerPoint.

350
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,358
Sometimes they just
want a phone call.

351
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,194
Don't suppose that you
know what the customer

352
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,762
wants the product to
look like, ask them.

353
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:09,068
There's nothing worse than
spending all this level

354
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,370
of effort on a product that
you think looks awesome

355
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,175
and fancy and insightful
only to get angry email

356
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,944
in all red font saying
I don't want this,

357
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,545
go back, do it again,
make it something

358
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,182
more digestible because
at the end of the day

359
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,384
intelligence is a
function of providing

360
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,986
that sort of decision
making support

361
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,556
to whoever that is
and then to provide

362
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,792
that answer in an easily
consumable way that they

363
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,628
can ingest that information
and then action on it.

364
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,299
And then the last part,
what does it help support?

365
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,235
That's a little
bit harder to do,

366
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:47,873
especially if you're in
a larger organization

367
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,776
with tens, hundreds of
thousands of people.

368
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,712
You may not necessarily
have the ability

369
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,180
to directly ask them,
what are you going

370
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,815
to do with this information
for a myriad of reasons

371
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,985
but if you can at least
start that conversation

372
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,155
to kind of either elicit a
response from that customer

373
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:08,160
or to take a moment and
look introspectively

374
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,896
to get into the customers
head and at least

375
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:16,902
try to look at their requests
from their point of view

376
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,171
in order to shape what that
end deliverable looks like.

377
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,779
So, how can you track RFI's?

378
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,647
I have some bad news and
I have some bad news.

379
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,983
One, it's all in
Outlook or office.

380
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,551
And the bad news is I
can't think of another

381
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,552
way better to do it.

382
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,822
So, we all know
threatened elements people

383
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,690
love their Excel spreadsheets.

384
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,294
And at least for tracking RFI's,

385
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,801
it's easy to have just
a few different columns.

386
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:53,205
Say, requester, subject,
due out, when do

387
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,139
they need it by,
and then status.

388
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,644
Granted if you have a large
number of intelligence

389
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,547
requirements, it can be
a lot harder to gauge

390
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,651
at least in an efficient
manner how effectively

391
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:09,054
you're able to process
those but it's at least

392
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,055
better than nothing.

393
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,493
It's also beneficial
to either separately

394
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,862
or in conjunction with
Excel to make an RFI

395
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,765
specific outlook inbox.

396
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,434
That way you can track the
lifecycle of the inbound

397
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,204
and outbound RFI's and be
able to have like a clear

398
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,539
timeline that you're
able to sort of judge

399
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,544
not only your own efficacy
but a more chronological

400
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,981
order of either how
you're processing those

401
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,951
or how many are coming in
on specific times or days.

402
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,387
And then I've seen it
done where you can kind of

403
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,456
sort of combine all three
of them with SharePoint

404
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,459
workflows to be able to
house the actual products

405
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,864
within SharePoint and
then connect it to Outlook

406
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,665
to be able to provide
some sort of automation

407
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,601
to that workflow
instead of sort of only

408
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,970
working in Outlook or
only working in Excel

409
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,740
and that sort of provides
a bit more flexibility

410
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,842
automation that way
you're not investing

411
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:08,847
too many analytic
cycles to devoting

412
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,984
how to engineer
something like this.

413
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,154
And maybe for the
vendors out there,

414
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,956
I think this could
provide an interesting

415
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,958
opportunity for some more
professional development

416
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,196
into some sort of functionality
within the threatened

417
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,298
help platforms of the
day to sort of either

418
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,568
help us manage those
RFI's or to either

419
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,838
integrate the requirements
process more holistically

420
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,175
within these platforms to
help us as intelligence

421
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,211
analysts provide the
value-added based off

422
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,813
what we're paying for
with these data sets

423
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,950
and intelligence platforms.

424
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,120
And in that way we're
not always constantly

425
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,089
and the idea with platforms
is that you're working

426
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,991
in the platform, the life
cycles in the platform

427
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,794
and if we can sort of
either programmatically,

428
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,096
systematically sort
of codify our efforts

429
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,098
in a one-stop shop I think
that would go a long way

430
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,501
in easing the cycles
that we as intelligence

431
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,237
professionals use
on sort of the more

432
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,905
intelligence administration
side of the house.

433
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,644
Okay, so now that you have
requirements, now what?

434
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,081
I'm going to tell you
metrics and before

435
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,150
everyone gets up and leaves,
I promise it'll be fine.

436
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,491
So, I know metrics are
one of the hardest things

437
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,627
for threat intelligence
shops to generate.

438
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,862
We know leadership
loves metrics.

439
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:34,533
They're easily
quantifiable identifiers

440
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,968
for the production levels
of a given organization

441
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,472
or team and given how
there's still a lot of

442
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,841
misunderstanding,
mis-conceptualization

443
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,677
on the side of the
leadership about what

444
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,347
intelligence does or
is and how to be able

445
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,482
to translate that into
something numerical,

446
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,785
I think that it's
just this interesting

447
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,555
cross play between the
leadership not understanding

448
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,324
the Intel side thinking
well we know what

449
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,393
we're doing, why can't you know.

450
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,795
And to be able to sort of
bridge that understanding

451
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,398
gap to have both sides
be on the same page

452
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,900
about what we're producing
and how we're meeting needs.

453
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,773
And so to start off,
you can say you have

454
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,808
a list of numbered requirements.

455
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,111
Requirements one through six.

456
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,414
You can also cross
those requirements

457
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,516
with the amount of products
that you're generating

458
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,118
tied to each specific
requirements.

459
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,221
So, you introduce
some sort of numbering

460
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,323
or tagging homenclature
within your finished

461
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,924
intelligence products
that can tie back

462
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,560
to specific intelligence
requirements

463
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,330
and then that will
show sort of at least

464
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,098
what your production
levels are and you can

465
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,533
also throw an RFI
answer too to show what

466
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:46,338
amount of time your analysts
are devoting to answering

467
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,007
those RFIs by what
they're answering in terms

468
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,942
of those enduring requirements.

469
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,181
And then so from there
you can take those numbers

470
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,452
and you can show your
intelligence customers

471
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,254
and the powers-that-be
where your production

472
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,789
is strongest and weakest.

473
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,557
So, say you have
intelligence requirement one

474
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,360
has 20 products,
intelligence requirement two

475
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,895
has five products,
intelligence requirement five

476
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,864
has zero, you can show
at least numerically,

477
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,800
our production is
strongest here,

478
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,436
our production is
weakest here and then

479
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:22,006
from there you can
start to postulate

480
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,843
as to why common
reasons for that are

481
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,478
collection or capability gaps.

482
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,881
I think it's important
to note here that through

483
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,150
the sort of gap analysis
through your intelligence

484
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,221
administration work that
you can not only identify

485
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,191
deficiencies with your
own internal capabilities

486
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,326
but larger organizational ones.

487
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,861
And then through
that sort of analysis

488
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,063
you can drive more
bigger picture strategic

489
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,665
procurement that can
help sort of mitigate

490
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,301
those visibility issues.

491
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,641
So, to kind of recap.

492
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,044
Requirements help you
align internal, external

493
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,612
data sources and
capabilities that meet

494
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,381
those specific
intelligence needs.

495
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,617
It sort of herds the
intelligence cats to sort of

496
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:09,254
focus on the few key issues
that are organizationally

497
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,323
relevant specific and
that we can help aid

498
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,860
in that decision-making
process in the end.

499
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,097
It can help you show
where your current

500
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,331
capabilities are lacking.

501
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,934
It can drive that
sort of bigger picture

502
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,970
system or data source
acquisition process

503
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,372
to help sort of
mitigate those gaps.

504
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,042
There's nothing worse
for an intelligence team

505
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,145
to say well we can't see
this, we can't answer

506
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,814
this question because
we don't have the data.

507
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,549
And then the bigger
question is okay why not?

508
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,418
And then that starts
that conversation.

509
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,053
It's not always fun but
at least you're pointing

510
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,122
what you know, what
you don't know,

511
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,024
and you can identify
avenues to help

512
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,191
sort of correct that.

513
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,665
And something else that
I think with requirements

514
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,167
that's beneficial
along with the metrics

515
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,601
that kind of helps set
the expectation of what

516
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,671
your team is currently
capable of producing,

517
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,107
what you are
producing, for whom,

518
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:06,077
the time for tasking
to time to completion,

519
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,713
you're able to extrapolate
a lot of sort of

520
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,582
analytic metadata from
the side of the analyst

521
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:16,054
themselves to help sort
of frame the efficacy

522
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,456
of your threat intelligence
program and how

523
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,224
it ties back to that
sort of bigger picture

524
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,258
organizational need.

525
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,065
And then so I have
some, a couple takeaways

526
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,601
before we wrap up for today.

527
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,470
I think I talked
a little bit fast.

528
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,507
So, we can't fix what
we didn't do yesterday

529
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,044
but if you take anything
away from my talk today

530
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,681
and your organization
isn't doing any sort of

531
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,017
requirements management
at all, I think it's time

532
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,385
to start that conversation.

533
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,857
We can't beat up ourselves
for being imperfect

534
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,426
or whatever the case
is but at least we can

535
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,794
start to correct that
change at least on an

536
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,832
organizational and
hopefully a bigger industry

537
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,668
perspective by integrating
the sort of requirements

538
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,937
management that's necessary
to make an effective

539
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,972
threat intel program.

540
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,075
To the best of your
ability try to make

541
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,276
it a team sport.

542
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,144
I know each organization
has their own

543
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,780
specific obstacles that
make that easier, harder

544
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,552
depending on where you
work but given your

545
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,487
positional capacity and
your access to leadership

546
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,958
as intelligence professionals
do try to get them

547
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,293
on the same page as you are.

548
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,530
They may not always
fully understand

549
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,131
what you're trying to articulate

550
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,202
through intelligence
work or how intelligence

551
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,938
functions as a whole
but if you invite them

552
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,073
into the process early
on it gives them a sense

553
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:46,811
of ownership and commitment
to having a successful

554
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,246
threat intel program
and then by providing

555
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:53,985
that timely cogent
analysis repeatedly over

556
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,654
the course of time
you'll be able to earn

557
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,790
that trust with your
policy and decision makers

558
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,992
and that will eventually
drive the growth

559
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,928
of your intelligence
team organizationally

560
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,266
and the impact that it brings
to wherever you're working.

561
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,303
And then finally,
we're all mostly

562
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,705
intelligence
professionals in here.

563
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,974
We extol the values of
intelligence, what it

564
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,644
can bring to an organization,
how the intelligence

565
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,314
cycle is our bread and
butter but it's clear

566
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,449
that we focus more
on the collection,

567
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,851
the exploitation, the
analysis and production side

568
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,854
where the feedback
and the requirements

569
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,090
generation process is sort
of left to the wayside

570
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,059
and there's a myriad
reasons for that

571
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,663
either due to people,
consumers, being just

572
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,400
recipients of intelligence
not engaged in that cycle

573
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,806
but in order to give
us as a discipline

574
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,543
more credibility we
need to do what we say,

575
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,213
do what we preach
and live and embody

576
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,849
the intelligence
tradecraft that we all know

577
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,784
and love because we'll
only be better for it

578
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,587
as analysts and
professionals but we'll also

579
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,756
make our organizations
more prepared

580
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,558
to defend against the adversary.

581
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:12,430
And then again, thank you
for my dank meme filled talk.

582
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,368
You can find me on
Twitter: @comradecookie.

583
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,870
I'll tell you the origin of
that over a beer sometime.

584
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,474
And in the immortal
words of Luke Skywalker,

585
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,042
requirements are
strong in my family,

586
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,243
you have that power too.

587
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,881
(applause)
