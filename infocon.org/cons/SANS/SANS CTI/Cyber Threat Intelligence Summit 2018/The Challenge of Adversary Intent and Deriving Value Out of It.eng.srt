1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,737
(soft music)

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,212
(audience applause)

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,948
- My name is Robert Lee, I
run a company called Dragos,

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,684
does industrial things,
that's cool, awesome team,

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,086
also made the
threat intelligence
course here at SANS,

6
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,787
and the incidence
response course

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,890
for industrial security.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,892
Today the intention of my talk

9
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,061
is to talk about
adversary intent

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,463
and understanding the
limitations of that,

11
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,799
as well as the difficulties
in achieving it,

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,467
and then trying to make
sense of it anyways

13
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,769
to see well, how can we
move forward this next year

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,038
to do a little bit better?

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,541
My background started
in the air force,

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,144
then it's public now,

17
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,611
went over to the
National Security Agency

18
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,313
and built their mission,
looking at nation states

19
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,649
breaking into industrial sites.

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,120
And I always found it useful
to bring down complex topics

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,890
for generals and
congressmen to comics,

22
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,758
so I still write
these every week,

23
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,193
and basically I thought, well,

24
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,296
how can I have an
entire talk in a comic?

25
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,565
So that was my
challenge for this one,

26
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,200
and here's my talk.

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,603
So the entire idea for me
around adversary intention,

28
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,738
and really where this occurred

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,274
that sort of spawned this talk,

30
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,910
is I saw some people, that I
very much love and respect,

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,044
and think that they're very,

32
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,545
very good intelligence
professionals,

33
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,348
have a discussion around
adversary intent with me,

34
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,753
that said, well, the Russian
state obviously intended

35
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,289
to do X, Y, and Z
in this operation,

36
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,890
and now that we
see them showing up

37
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,792
in this other
portion of the world.

38
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,495
I don't understand it,
it breaks our model,

39
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,430
therefore something
must be wrong,

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,000
because Russia would
never do this operation.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,270
Which led me in an almost
exacerbated kind of fashion

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,339
to say, how would you know?

43
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,141
Have you ever been
a Russian operator,

44
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,676
have you been one at this point,

45
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,211
have you worked for that
specific general commander

46
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,513
or whoever that might be
authorizing that campaign?

47
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,015
It makes no sense for
us as professionals

48
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,250
to pontificate wildly

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,718
about what others
that we've never been

50
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,820
will or won't do in
given situations.

51
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,988
That actually just literally
does not make sense.

52
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,525
Understanding the
intention of the adversary

53
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,993
ends up being one of
the most difficult

54
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,061
intelligence
requirements, period.

55
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,430
It's actually one
of the first things

56
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,098
a lot of your
executives will ask.

57
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:12,932
Well, who did it?

58
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,801
So do attribution first.

59
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,136
And then tell me
why they did it,

60
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,704
and then get to that.

61
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,405
That is a very, very, very
difficult thing to do.

62
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,108
We can look, actually
publicly recently

63
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,977
on how difficult that can be.

64
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,146
During the democratic
national convention,

65
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,750
DNC compromise, post that
the NSA, CIA, and FBI

66
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,553
put out a document that tried
to have a public discussion

67
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,356
around who was
responsible and why.

68
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,192
One of the things that
the media grabbed onto

69
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,194
and showed as a bad thing,

70
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,164
which I actually grabbed onto
and thought as a good thing,

71
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,635
was when it came time for the
intent of why it was done,

72
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,571
there was a
disagreement of sorts.

73
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,873
So on the who had done it,

74
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,376
all three of them,
FBI, CIA, and NSA

75
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,546
came to the conclusion that yes

76
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,183
the Russian nation state
adversary did these actions,

77
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,118
they ran the campaign.

78
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,853
When it came time
to why they did it,

79
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,321
the CIA put forth an assessment

80
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,958
to say well, it was to
get Donald Trump elected,

81
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,059
that was their intent.

82
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,795
The NSA came out and said,

83
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,298
moderate confidence assessment,
we say the same thing.

84
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,366
We're not a high confidence
assessment like the CIA.

85
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,535
And the FBI came out with a
high confidence assessment.

86
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,504
Two intelligence agencies
high confidence assessment,

87
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,539
NSA moderate
confidence assessment.

88
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,041
The way that those
statements worked though,

89
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,210
is it's actually still, it's
not a well we're kinda 50/50,

90
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,144
a moderate confidence assessment

91
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,612
is still really, really good.

92
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,947
It's really difficult to get to

93
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,315
a high confidence assessment.

94
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,450
But what that showed
me, very publicly,

95
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,751
was independent
school of thought.

96
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,055
It was actually that they
were not being skewed.

97
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,023
There was a independent approach

98
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,024
to say, look, we're not just

99
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,159
gonna theme this
high confidence,

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,660
'cause it's
politically relevant,

101
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,162
we actually wanna have
a difference opinion,

102
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,632
we can't get to the same
place you are today, CIA.

103
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,867
And there might be a
million reasons for that.

104
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:59,304
One of the potential reasons
had to do with collection.

105
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,873
If you are the NSA,
and you are living

106
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,441
off of signals
intelligence networks,

107
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,878
and telephone calls,
and cyber things,

108
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,114
you might not have what
you need from collection

109
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,883
to be able to make that
type of assessment.

110
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,453
If you're the CIA
and potentially have
someone in the room,

111
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,455
who heard it get authorized,

112
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,656
you might have better collection

113
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,524
to support that assessment.

114
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,959
And so for my talk,
I'm gonna focus

115
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,695
on two things right up front,

116
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,132
and then extract it out
across three case studies,

117
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,400
and then the final
fourth case study

118
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,001
of what you should
do this next year,

119
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,236
and I wanna theme
it in industrial

120
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,604
'cause that's what
my background's in,

121
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,139
it's what I really care about.

122
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,842
So the two sort of accepted
assumptions right up front,

123
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,178
number one, we all
have a collection bias,

124
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,615
and it is much worse
than everybody realizes.

125
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,717
So I'll give you an example
in industrial security

126
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,952
to sort of draw this out.

127
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,689
Historically speaking, I
think companies out there

128
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,791
have done a fantastic
job of understanding

129
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,926
our IT threat landscape.

130
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,596
What are the various Chinese,
Russian, North Korean,

131
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,431
whoever groups doing things?

132
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,200
FireEye, Symantec,
Microsoft, name your vendor,

133
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,137
they've done a fantastic
job historically

134
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,205
of understanding that.

135
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,607
Why?

136
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,475
Because they have
collection to support it.

137
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,245
They're either doing incident
response cases to get data,

138
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:16,282
or more often, there's
internet connected sensors

139
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,284
like antivirus, and firewalls,

140
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,551
and in point protection systems

141
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,120
that they see intrusions,

142
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,690
and across those
intrusions can do analysis

143
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,292
to come up with an idea
about adversary campaigns.

144
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,926
That is their collection.

145
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:32,799
We have historically never had
that in industrial security.

146
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,299
In an industrial network,

147
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,735
the type that runs
your power grid,

148
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,237
your water filtration,
your oil and gas pipelines,

149
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,672
we've never really had that.

150
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,841
We've not even had specialized
incident response teams

151
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,576
in the industrial environment.

152
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,178
So a lot of people
operate under the notion

153
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,913
that there just
aren't threats there,

154
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,282
which is silly, because we're
just not collecting the data

155
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,517
to actually be able
to see those threats.

156
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,986
This was sort of magnified out

157
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,489
by the ICS-CERT from the DHS.

158
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,924
ICS-CERT no longer exists,

159
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,459
but while they did exist,
they did a good job

160
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,494
of trying to capture some
metrics of the community.

161
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,730
One of the metrics that the
journalist grabbed every year

162
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,799
was 250 so energy
companies were compromised.

163
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,935
That's not really the point.

164
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,637
What the interesting
data set was

165
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,373
that nobody ever approached,
but you could look,

166
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,675
and it's there every single
year in the report they put out,

167
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,143
was the number one attack vector

168
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,212
into industrial control
systems was unknown,

169
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,382
they have no clue, they
have no freaking clue

170
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,583
how that happened.

171
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,084
The number two
was spear fishing.

172
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,152
And everyone's like,
yeah, that makes sense.

173
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,320
No, it doesn't.

174
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,021
We don't have email
servers in DCS

175
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,790
and skid environments
on our oil rigs.

176
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,325
What the metrics
were actually saying

177
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,995
is if we caught it, it was
'cause IT folks caught it

178
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,397
coming from the
business networks

179
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,633
into the industrial networks,
or we've got no clue.

180
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,668
There's a collection
bias in the community.

181
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,904
I can show it in the
industrial side fairly easily.

182
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,339
It exists everywhere.

183
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,509
Why don't we hear more
about NSA, and CIA, and FBI,

184
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,912
and whoever teams
outside of leaks?

185
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,013
'Cause I haven't seen a
Chinese security company

186
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,249
that's really doing
threat intelligence

187
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,650
to put that data together.

188
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,051
When that happens, there will be

189
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,354
a lot of historical
data to show.

190
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,022
Everybody's who's got
an intelligence team

191
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,924
are usually biased
by our collection.

192
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,258
Does FireEye hate China

193
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,827
and they keep publishing
things on China?

194
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,061
No.

195
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:09,996
Their customers are
the type of customers

196
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,229
that are getting targeted,

197
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,632
so they have that
kind of collection.

198
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,100
The same reason you
probably haven't heard a lot

199
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,636
about the Pakistani APT,

200
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,472
is because you're not an
Indian energy company.

201
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,775
So collection, the collection
bias is real in our community.

202
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,010
The second point that I'll make

203
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,445
to get into the
actual discussion

204
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,515
is our ability to do
attribution in a community

205
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,150
is a little rocky at best,

206
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,619
which I feel is the
understatement of
this conference.

207
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,822
But let me expose this
a little bit further,

208
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,491
APT29 and Cozy Bear,

209
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,592
I think those are the
two they put together,

210
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,094
hard to get your bears in line.

211
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,631
So APT29, Cozy Bear, many
people come out and say

212
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,500
these are the same groups.

213
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,202
Well, FireEye calls it APT29,

214
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,271
and CrowdStrike
calls it Cozy Bear.

215
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,406
You'll even see that

216
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,607
in government documents
around the time,

217
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,541
where they said, yeah,
these two groups,

218
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,477
just call 'em whatever you want.

219
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,111
As a purist, I'd push back
that that's very silly,

220
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,815
because their investigations
that CrowdStrike did,

221
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,350
and the intrusion
analysis they did

222
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,652
to come up with what
they called Cozy Bear,

223
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,655
cannot be a one for one
match with what FireEye did

224
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,224
to come up with APT29.

225
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,390
They worked on
different data sets,

226
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,526
they had different customers,

227
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,361
they represent
different intrusions,

228
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,462
so to just say that there's
a one to one transfer

229
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,799
is very disingenuous.

230
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,768
But it introduces another
point for this talk,

231
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,404
which is, is it
still good enough.

232
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,906
And this actually goes
back to Thomas' point.

233
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,308
We don't wanna
over-forensicate ourselves,

234
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,245
we don't wanna over-focus
on individual data points

235
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,080
that we forget the big picture.

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,415
So I would leave you,
well not say leave you,

237
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:38,683
you've still gotta put up
with me the next 30 minutes,

238
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,885
but on that topic,
I'll leave you

239
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,353
with a very simple thing
just to think about.

240
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,155
I don't actually have
the answer for you.

241
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,689
But the very simple
thing to think about

242
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,960
is knowing that they actually
cannot be the same data sets,

243
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,829
and they absolutely
cannot necessarily

244
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,863
represent the same adversary,

245
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,734
it's just our perception
of an adversary.

246
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,169
Is it good enough, or is it not?

247
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,371
So just something
to think about.

248
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,240
Alright, so the
thing that I wanted

249
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,508
to highlight though
in attribution

250
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,410
is that good enough factor.

251
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,246
How many of you, let's
just do a show of hands,

252
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,949
how many of you have ever
seen anybody come out

253
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,550
from a vendor, or
even government

254
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,620
and say it was
nation state acts,

255
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,522
it was China, it was
Russia, it was Iran,

256
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,391
name anybody
attribution in general?

257
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,925
Let's get the hands up.

258
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,427
Alright how many of you have
seen attribution in general?

259
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,362
Alright, most of you are
participating in the talk,

260
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,363
some of you are just
out of it, that's fine,

261
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,632
'cause everybody has seen this.

262
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,733
Alright, good.

263
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,435
How many of you have ever seen

264
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,904
the vendor follow
back up and say,

265
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,707
oh, no, we were wrong,
it was somebody else?

266
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,275
Alright, maybe
one or two, three,

267
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,045
alright, much less,
not usually common.

268
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,113
I would say that we probably
get it wrong a lot of times,

269
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,783
and just don't go back
and look at it again.

270
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,285
More importantly
though, does it matter?

271
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,789
I think that does that matter
theme sort of resonates here.

272
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,091
How are you using that
information differently,

273
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,093
knowing that it was
nation state acts?

274
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,493
I actually have a huge
problem with attribution.

275
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,330
I wrote a blog post a while ago,

276
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,932
specifically saying that
attribution misleads us.

277
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,169
If I say China's
in your network,

278
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,071
what do you think they're after?

279
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,472
Who's got it?

280
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,707
Intellectual property.

281
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,241
If I say Russia's
in your network,

282
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,410
what do you think are
activities that you might see?

283
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,716
Propaganda, or another big
one's always cuber crime,

284
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,217
I think I heard
one person say it,

285
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,718
maybe even military preparation.

286
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,588
Iran is in your networks, what
do you think you might see?

287
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,890
Total destruction.

288
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,759
Absolutely, disruptive nature.

289
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,094
US is in your networks,

290
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,029
what might you think
they're there for?

291
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,432
Spying, counter-terrorism
is a big one.

292
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,235
Okay, all of that
is literally bias.

293
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,037
It's completely ridiculous.

294
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,306
Every one of these teams
does all of these actions.

295
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,874
Every team has an intellectual
property theft team,

296
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,409
everybody has
military operations,

297
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,778
it is across the board,
everybody does everything,

298
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,781
but we have seen a case or two,

299
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,281
and we've seen media around it,

300
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,450
so we have the
perception that well,

301
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,386
China does intellectual
property theft.

302
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,087
So why does this hurt you?

303
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,024
Here's why I think attribution
actually hurts your teams.

304
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,192
If I put in front of
an incident responder

305
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,962
as an intelligence
analyst, a playbook

306
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,732
of here is what adversary
cash register squirrel

307
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,634
or whatever, some made up name,

308
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,036
here is what their
trade craft is,

309
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,037
here is what they're doing,

310
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,006
and here's what I think
they're trying to do.

311
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,610
If I put in front of them, oh,
and by the way, it's China,

312
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,178
they're instantly
going to start thinking

313
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
about intellectual
property theft.

314
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,116
That campaign, or that adversary
that they're looking at

315
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,751
might not be that team.

316
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,087
It might be going
after cyber crime,

317
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,290
or whatever else, but
instantly they've been biased

318
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,224
from things they've
heard that it must be

319
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,261
intellectual property
theft in there somewhere,

320
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,129
and so they will look for it.

321
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,998
I would say that
attribution is not only

322
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,067
mostly useless
for our community,

323
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,069
it is almost always damaging

324
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,137
to your tactical
level defenders.

325
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,238
For the strategic folks
that you are actually

326
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,709
going to use that
information, go for it.

327
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,679
If you are going to change
the way your run your company,

328
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,781
change national level
intelligence requirements

329
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,484
or some other ways use the
information, feel free.

330
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,886
If it is an
intelligence requirement

331
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,887
to actually make
change, go for it.

332
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,890
If it is not, be very wary.

333
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,593
So starting discussion,
we have a collection bias,

334
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,897
and attribution is sometimes
very, very difficult,

335
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,332
if not harmful.

336
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,167
So those are my two starting
points for discussion.

337
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,504
So I wanna go through
a couple case studies

338
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,507
that show some of the difficulty
with adversary intention

339
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,175
and get to a point where
we discuss about that,

340
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,645
is it good enough, and
leave you with a takeaway

341
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,280
of what I hope you
do this next year.

342
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,052
My first case
study, Ukraine 2015.

343
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,688
You've probably heard me talk
about this at some point,

344
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,957
or maybe in the
past CGI summits.

345
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,925
Long story short,
first time in history

346
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,295
a cyber attack took out a
portion of a power grid,

347
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,564
basically stopped
operations, just six hours,

348
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,367
but stopped operations
due to a cyber attack.

349
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,337
So I got to be involved
in the investigation,

350
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,773
put out some papers about
it, good stuff, cool.

351
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,374
Here's the interesting aspect,

352
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,576
in the years following,
I've been involved

353
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,812
in a lot of very senior
national level discussions

354
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,248
where people have asked, why?

355
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,350
Still here in
2018, going forward

356
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,118
past a lot of other
attacks we've seen,

357
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,454
that question still comes
up, and it is of value.

358
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,323
I don't wanna downplay that,
but the question comes up,

359
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,659
why, why did they do this?

360
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,095
What was their intention,
what can we learn from that?

361
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,596
How do we posture differently?

362
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,901
Six months before the attack
is when the adversary started

363
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,037
getting access to
those networks.

364
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,006
So they sent the
spearfishing emails,

365
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,507
got access to the
corporate networks,

366
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,041
that was like three
days worth of effort,

367
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,277
got into the
industrial networks,

368
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,711
and operated in those
industrial networks

369
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,147
for about six months
before the attack.

370
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,018
I think it was like two months
or so before that attack,

371
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,854
which was December 23rd.

372
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,624
Two months before
that pylons, towers,

373
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,495
electric power towers
were destroyed in Crimea.

374
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,331
Extremists favoring the Ukraine

375
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,533
destroyed the pylons,

376
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,871
and basically what
happened behind the scenes

377
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,540
is President Putin
and the Russian staff

378
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,742
reached out and
said, hey Ukraine,

379
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,779
that's our power for our
naval base in Crimea,

380
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,614
could you restore the pylons?

381
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,283
And I imagine the Ukrainians
had some affect of

382
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,721
(Rob laughing) good
luck with that.

383
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,556
So no, they did not help.

384
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,592
That probably pissed
some people off.

385
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,229
So at the national level
was a big discussion

386
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,699
of were the attack on the pylons

387
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,335
and the aspect of the Ukrainians
would not help the Russians

388
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,440
part of the catalyst for
attacking their power grid

389
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,442
and taking down a
portion of that power?

390
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,112
I wanna sort of advise
you on the same way

391
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,615
that I advised the
government, saying,

392
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,284
the government by the
way, the post office, no,

393
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,953
the government officials
that there is never

394
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,387
one intelligence requirement.

395
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,359
There is no one consumer
of an operation.

396
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,593
And so there's some
disparity there

397
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,127
that we have to
take into account.

398
00:14:56,128 --> 00:15:00,499
If the pylons attack happened
two months before the attack,

399
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,069
and the operation began
six months before that,

400
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,437
most people would throw them out

401
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,906
and say they can't be related.

402
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,674
One started four months
before it was even a thing,

403
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,608
that can't be the reason.

404
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,811
On the other hand,
we can go and say,

405
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,613
well adversaries
generally get access

406
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,515
to environments long
before they need it,

407
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,785
maybe they just needed it and
two months later they used it.

408
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,554
And this disparity
operates in a binary world

409
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,722
that is either one or the other,

410
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,557
and that's just not the case.

411
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,093
There could have been
intelligence requirements

412
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,596
from the adversary
to gain access

413
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,532
to those environments
for any reason.

414
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,200
There could've been additional
intelligence requirements

415
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,903
which we do not
understand at all,

416
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,338
because we are not the operators

417
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,807
or consumers of that operation.

418
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,876
And there are also the
very real possibility

419
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,880
that when the pylons went down
other players got involved,

420
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,581
and said, what
capabilities do we have

421
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,251
to inflict punishment
on the Ukrainian people

422
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,086
for this operation?

423
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,854
And could've levied
the access they had

424
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,424
to have filled those
intelligence requirements.

425
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,326
And so the thing
that I retorted back

426
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,728
to the Master
Security Council folks

427
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,195
was does it matter?

428
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,532
We will never know the
intelligence requirements

429
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,766
that went into that.

430
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,300
We only exist in the world

431
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,005
that somebody took down a
portion of the power grid

432
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,974
for the first time in history,

433
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,343
and we still have not had
a single western leader

434
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,743
ever come out to condemn it.

435
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,479
That's a bigger impact.

436
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,382
Our inability to respond,

437
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,550
because we're too concerned

438
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,285
about getting
adversary intention,

439
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,021
has a much bigger
precedent on the community,

440
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,122
that has basically
said that's okay.

441
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,593
For years, we've argued
that attacks on power grids

442
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,094
would be the red line.

443
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,363
Civilian critical
infrastructure,

444
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,831
that's the red line.

445
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,400
Our inability to act over
that question though,

446
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,002
was more damaging than
we ever could've had

447
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,804
benefit of
understanding the why.

448
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,606
Second case study,

449
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:54,313
so in 2014 there was a attack
on a German steel facility.

450
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,150
I've dug as much
as I can into this,

451
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,685
but there's not a lot
of data out there.

452
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,954
Now the German government

453
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,454
actually came out
and confirmed it,

454
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,257
and said, rightfully so, we
don't wanna talk about it,

455
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,159
which is perfectly
German and awesome.

456
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,096
From my research into it,

457
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,698
and in talking with the various

458
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,466
steel company
personnel in Germany,

459
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:15,733
there's not too many of them,

460
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,569
so I got to do a bunch
of interviews around,

461
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,107
based off of that
environment and where it was,

462
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,108
and what was going
on, it appears,

463
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,343
and you could make
an assessment,

464
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,945
it is not a high
confidence assessment,

465
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,213
you could make an assessment

466
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,783
that the adversary was
in those environments,

467
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,885
and they were stealing
off, potentially,

468
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,320
a lot of, careful
word choices here,

469
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,990
potentially stealing off
intellectual property.

470
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,491
And for a lot of
you you would go,

471
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,360
what intellectual property
does a steel facility have?

472
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,860
Well it turns out,

473
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,798
the way that you take really
cheap and awful materials

474
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,499
and turn it into
really high quality

475
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,767
and high-priced steel

476
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,403
is good trade secrets
intellectual property.

477
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,305
And if you're going to
pull that out of a company,

478
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,840
you don't get it
in the IT networks.

479
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,809
You are going into the
industrial control networks,

480
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,610
and operating right
with the equipment,

481
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,245
and understanding
things like temperature,

482
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,348
and pressure, and feed going
into the blast furnace.

483
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,720
In that attack though, following
the adversary's activity,

484
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,291
it resulted in a massive
physical destruction.

485
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,958
So again, in the
world of industrial,

486
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,361
we are very careful in
the word cyber attack,

487
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,231
because in our world, attack
could mean loss of life.

488
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,966
Nobody has ever died in IT

489
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,633
because a database
adjoin was done.

490
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,370
We've literally lost people
in the ICS community,

491
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,572
because that was done in
a location in California.

492
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,175
We're very, very careful
about the word of attack.

493
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,344
In this environment though,

494
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,480
the adversary stealing
off intellectual property,

495
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,649
potentially, resulted
in, I wanna be careful

496
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,851
with the word choice here,

497
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,119
resulted in a condition
where the operators

498
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,721
could not shut down
the blast furnace,

499
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,891
which resulted in massive
physical destruction

500
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,161
in that facility, and they're
lucky people didn't die.

501
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,496
So the question then
immediately comes up

502
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,064
from an adversary's
intention perspective

503
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,233
is did the adversary
intend to do that?

504
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,403
Was it an aspect that
they mucked around

505
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,571
with sensitive
control environments

506
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,772
they didn't fully understand,

507
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,774
that led to an event
that was uncontrollable?

508
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,578
And led to an event where
there was physical destruction?

509
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,348
I think that is a perfectly
founded hypothesis.

510
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,015
Or was it just a byproduct

511
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,351
and a second
intelligence requirement

512
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,019
of after you do the attack,

513
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,155
after you steal off the
intellectual property

514
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,790
go ahead and do an attack,
and it will cover the trail

515
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,059
of the intellectual
property theft?

516
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,428
For over a month
after the attack,

517
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,131
the operators did not
know it was a cyber event.

518
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,534
They actually just
thought it was

519
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,602
a manufacturing issue in
the production process,

520
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,704
did not realize it
was a quote unquote

521
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,173
cyber component to it.

522
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,841
For almost a month after that,

523
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,008
they were trying to figure out

524
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,943
what the root
cause analysis was,

525
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,444
and what that even meant.

526
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,146
So I have equally
positioned this

527
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,748
in front of the National
Security Council,

528
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,783
and various congressional
and senate level members,

529
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,752
of what would you do?

530
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,754
You have just been
told there is an attack

531
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:53,559
on civilian infrastructure
in the United States,

532
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,494
and let's go ahead
and say people died,

533
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,798
and we don't know
if it was actually

534
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,033
intended to be an attack,

535
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,868
and we don't even get
to attribution yet,

536
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,303
and it could be 2-3
months before we could

537
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,104
even begin to answer
that question.

538
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,239
How do you handle that?

539
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,575
Which is always difficult
for us to process,

540
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,542
so I then flip it, and I say,

541
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,944
well, this'll be an easier one.

542
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:16,615
NSA just breaks into a
petrochemical plant in Russia.

543
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,684
They're there to
steal information,

544
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,321
and by doing so, they
accidentally kill 200 people,

545
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,057
what's your mechanism to
follow up with Russia on that?

546
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,459
And I have to tell you,

547
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,394
the uncomfortable truth
is nobody has an answer.

548
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,064
There's no magic playbook for
that in government channels.

549
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,600
There's no ability,
internationally speaking,

550
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,968
for us to reach out,
for Putin and Trump

551
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,503
to get on a phone
call together and go,

552
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,105
hey man, we meant to steal
that intellectual property,

553
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,674
we meant to target you, did not
intend to kill those people,

554
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,343
we're so sorry.

555
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,912
That's not a conversation
that will exist.

556
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,647
It's not one that happens today,

557
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,014
and do not hope that
that conversation
is gonna take place,

558
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:50,816
it will not.

559
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,086
How do we deal with that?

560
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,121
What was the
adversary's intention?

561
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,024
It is in that case unknowable,

562
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,593
but we are still presented with
the facts of what happened,

563
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,962
and we have to learn
to deal with that.

564
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,897
So I'll give you a
third case study,

565
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,966
and I'll try to tie
all this together.

566
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,870
We just got through, my
firm just got through

567
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,604
analyzing and
publicly talking about

568
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,107
a case known as Trisis.

569
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,608
You might also know it by
the FireEye name of Triton.

570
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,411
FireEye did some fantastic
research on it as well.

571
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,812
Our general approach
at my company

572
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,046
is we don't really
talk about a lot

573
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,915
of industrial attacks
and things publicly,

574
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,517
because you're generally
not in the community

575
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,985
to deal with it.

576
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,219
And if you were in the
community to deal with it,

577
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,488
we would tell you, or
we would get through

578
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,956
government channels to
let you figure it out,

579
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,256
but it doesn't need to
be in the New York Times,

580
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,559
because that's never
helpful to anybody.

581
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,062
So in this case,
with what is public,

582
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,632
there's another
interesting twist

583
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,502
in the intention discussion
that actually sort of favors us

584
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,903
from a technical perspective.

585
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,473
The adversary in
the Middle East,

586
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,774
somewhere in the Middle East,

587
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,878
the adversary targeted
a industrial process.

588
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,946
The victim is not known,
we know who the victim is,

589
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,314
but we haven't come out and
talked about the victim,

590
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816
'cause it's not important.

591
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,551
We don't need to put the
victim's name in the press.

592
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,453
I've seen some people
do that, by the way.

593
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,120
They've used their
intelligence skills

594
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,489
to piece together things,

595
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,491
and like 16 different
data points later,

596
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,293
somehow it was Iran
and Saudi Aramco

597
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,261
that were getting blamed.

598
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,729
That's stupid.

599
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,331
We should be more mature
than that in the community,

600
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,198
'cause these things
have real impact.

601
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,968
Saudi Aramco right now is
looking forward to an IPO,

602
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,470
and a lot of the
IPO is benefiting

603
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,105
modernization in their country,

604
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,040
maybe don't be a
jackass publicly

605
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,675
about data you're
not sure about,

606
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,043
gonna impact a country's future.

607
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:26,878
Be careful.

608
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,782
When we are looking
at this case though,

609
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,251
what the adversary
did was they developed

610
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,454
a specific piece of
ICS tailored malware.

611
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:39,558
There's only been five,
Stuxnet targeting Iran,

612
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,627
Havex and BlackEnergy Two,
espionage-like campaigns,

613
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,096
Crash Override
took down the grid

614
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,764
in the Ukraine the second time,

615
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,032
and now this, Trisis.

616
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,668
So only five pieces of
ICS tailored malware.

617
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,968
You don't need to
have tailored malware

618
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,270
to do disruption in
an ICS environment,

619
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,472
these cases it was.

620
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,640
The interesting
thing about Trisis

621
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,042
is it goes after a system

622
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,276
called safety instrumented
system, an SIS.

623
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:05,417
When we think of Stuxnet
tearing up centrifuges in Iran,

624
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,986
that is protection equipment.

625
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,122
It went after and fooled
protection equipment

626
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,124
to protect the centrifuges,

627
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,626
and therefore was able
to destroy things.

628
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,228
So we usually have
our control systems,

629
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,830
and then sometimes we
have protection systems.

630
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,499
There's also safety systems.

631
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,068
Safety systems
protect human life.

632
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,905
The only purpose of an SIS
is to protect human life

633
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,106
in that environment.

634
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,574
Basically when you build
an extremely complex

635
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,610
industrial process that
might kill a lot of people,

636
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,344
you call some experts
in, and some engineers

637
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,547
to do an assessment, usually
a process how to analysis.

638
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,351
You say hey, come do the PHA,
and tell me how bad it looks.

639
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,887
And there's ratings,
SIL up to four,

640
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,956
so safety instrument
level up to four.

641
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,190
If it's four,

642
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,793
you generally need to go
redesign your process,

643
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,995
it's too dangerous to
put back into control.

644
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,263
If it's one, two, or three,

645
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,563
you can put a safety
instrumented system

646
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,632
that's specifically designed

647
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,033
for that industrial process only

648
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,436
to bring it down to
a safe condition,

649
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,004
where even if things go crazy,

650
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,206
we built our systems well
enough to not kill people.

651
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,375
Interestingly enough,
security and safety,

652
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,709
they generally go hand in hand.

653
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,745
They do not in this case.

654
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,281
The security of
that safety system

655
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,984
can be compromised, but as
long as it protects human life,

656
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,321
it's it's job, so it
has done it's work

657
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,790
regardless if it's
secure or not.

658
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,493
Interesting sort of shift there.

659
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,463
So in this case,
this Trisis malware

660
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,730
was specifically designed

661
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,300
to target the safety
instrumented system,

662
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,037
and by our analysis, it appears,

663
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,572
and this is still an
ongoing investigation,

664
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,541
it appears that they
were potentially

665
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,077
trying to remove the safety
logic off the system.

666
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,946
So instead of
breaking the system

667
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,981
or denying service to
it, actually removing

668
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,917
the here's what makes the
process safe information

669
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,720
out of the system,
which we do not know,

670
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,655
this is just a if
I was the bad guy,

671
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,057
which is mirroring,
which is horrible,

672
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,291
but here it is anyways.

673
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,092
If I was the bad guy,
you would then follow up

674
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,162
with another attack on
the industrial process,

675
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,663
and now you could do an attack

676
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,466
that would lead to
an unsafe condition,

677
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,568
and the safety system
wouldn't kick in.

678
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,170
And you wouldn't
know, by the way,

679
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,671
you wouldn't know if there
was no other indications

680
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,373
that your safety system
was modified with,

681
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,142
that your safety system was
no longer working as intended.

682
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:13,879
They messed up.

683
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,848
And we can give a really
high confidence assessment

684
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,985
that they messed up, because
we analyzed the embedded code,

685
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,289
and specifically said, ah, in
normal programming language,

686
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,757
and I don't wanna
advertise the adversary

687
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,025
too much of where
they messed up,

688
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,462
but in normal ways of
dealing with systems,

689
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,831
the value that they
were trying to read

690
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,466
and interact with
would've been fine,

691
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,435
and the safety system
wouldn't have crashed,

692
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,539
and then their attack
logic would've kicked in.

693
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,840
They messed up something,

694
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,042
and I don't wanna tip
our hat too much here,

695
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,843
but they messed up
something which resulted

696
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,313
in the safety system
crashing instead.

697
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,515
And so when the
safety system crashed,

698
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,985
it did it's job of shutting
down the industrial process.

699
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,254
So it said, hey, the
safety system's out,

700
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,358
we can't protect life anymore,
we should stop operations.

701
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,861
So the results to the defenders

702
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,464
was their industrial process
at this facility shut down.

703
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,233
It looked like an
attack, it was,

704
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,136
but it looked like an attack
of we have lost operations,

705
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,772
but I'm gonna make an assessment

706
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,206
about the adversary's intention,

707
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,841
which I just said how
difficult this can be,

708
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,676
but here's why.

709
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,413
In our assessment
of the situation,

710
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,749
only two realities really exist.

711
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,420
Either the adversary intended

712
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,988
to take down the safety system,

713
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,756
and intended to remove
the safety logic,

714
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,093
fully intending to kill people,

715
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,828
or they didn't care.

716
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,798
They targeted the safety system

717
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,766
with enough knowledge
about how to do so

718
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,834
that they had to understand

719
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,102
that targeting a safety system

720
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,303
would lead to the resulting case

721
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,339
of loss of human life,

722
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,274
and that they were
just okay with that.

723
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,309
So either it was their
intention to do it on purpose,

724
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,445
or they were just okay
with killing people.

725
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,148
That is a game changer
in our discussion,

726
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,083
by the way, around
anything InfoSec,

727
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,588
but here's where
intent of the adversary

728
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,923
gets interesting for me.

729
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,427
I now don't really care what
the adversary intended to do.

730
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,562
I'm left with two good options,

731
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,599
and I feel good in arriving
to those two conclusions,

732
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,402
and the ability for me to
enact change based off of that

733
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,670
to make assessments
to my customers,

734
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,271
to make assessments
to the community

735
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,438
of the national governments

736
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,674
around how we're
gonna deal with that,

737
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,609
doesn't change between
the two options.

738
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,944
Either someone was
really cool with it,

739
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,678
or they intended, either
way they're an asshole,

740
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,080
and we should talk about it.

741
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,516
We are left with
actionable information,

742
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,753
regardless of the difficulties
of intent leading up to it,

743
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,487
and that's what I
want you to get to.

744
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,624
I want you to hone
down largely enough

745
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,193
to get to a
perception of intent,

746
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,129
not true intent, please
don't pretend to know

747
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,464
what the North Korean
operators were doing,

748
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,733
but get to a level where
your perception of intent

749
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,467
satisfies your
intelligence requirements,

750
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,971
and if it doesn't matter,
don't worry about it.

751
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,172
Don't spend the resources,

752
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,774
'cause it's very
resource intensive.

753
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,409
So here's a, last example,
I'd say the fourth case today

754
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,844
is to sort of have
a recommendation

755
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,079
for what you should
do this next year.

756
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,414
And I'm gonna weave in
those initial points

757
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,916
around collection
and attribution.

758
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,186
When a company
comes out and says,

759
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,055
this is a campaign targeting
the electric sector,

760
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,158
and a couple of
them have done that.

761
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,659
One of my first questions
to those companies

762
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,729
is where's your collection?

763
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,930
Well, what do you mean?

764
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,898
Well, you just said
it was targeted

765
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,399
towards the energy sector,

766
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,202
do you have a lot
of mining customers?

767
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,705
Do you have a lot of
transportation customers?

768
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,938
Well no, we're really active

769
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,407
in the electric
energy community.

770
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,743
Oh, okay, well then
you're doing collection

771
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,046
in electric energy, so you see
intrusion in electric energy,

772
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,681
and so you associate
it that the campaign

773
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,483
is targeted towards
electric energy,

774
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,186
but it could be targeted
a lot of other industries.

775
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,721
So by saying it is targeted

776
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,622
towards the electric
energy community,

777
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,725
you've just told
other communities not
to worry about it,

778
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,092
don't put it in
the threat model,

779
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,227
which is not a real answer,

780
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,395
because you don't know.

781
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,398
So for all of you that
are practitioners,

782
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,033
I want you to be very
careful this next year

783
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,535
and how you make
those assessments,

784
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,671
and appreciate your
lack of collection.

785
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,639
It's okay, it's not
even being wrong,

786
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,042
it's just being honest,
to say you know what,

787
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,311
we did a lot of collection
in the Middle East

788
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,913
in oil and gas networks, and
that's what it looks like.

789
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,415
They are definitely
being targeted

790
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,616
based off our observation.

791
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,550
That's a fact.

792
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,518
There's no assessment there.

793
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,452
Are there victims?

794
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,020
Okay, that's a fact.

795
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,456
We can talk about that,
but let's not pretend

796
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,493
it doesn't increase the scope
other parts of the world

797
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,329
to deincentivise other
people from doing security.

798
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,465
Actually our whole perception
of campaigns in the community

799
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,769
is entirely driven
from a defender basis.

800
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,237
I get in wonderful
conversations these days

801
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,772
with my director
of intel, Sergio,

802
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,906
the guy who created
the Diamond Model.

803
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,707
It's fun to be in slack,

804
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,109
going back and forth
on these topics,

805
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,377
and one of the things
that he put forth

806
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,845
that I thought was
really important,

807
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:44,649
was we will always have a
defenders bias of a campaign.

808
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:48,285
We don't know all the different
targets of the adversary,

809
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,588
we only know our
perception of the victims.

810
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:54,091
So the campaign is not as well
defined as we think it is.

811
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,593
And only the
adversary could know

812
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,428
what their mission
objectives were

813
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,230
to take it past that campaign.

814
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,065
So we are left wanting
in the community,

815
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,368
but it doesn't have to
leave wanting in inaction,

816
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,569
we can still use this.

817
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,904
So here's my second
recommendation,

818
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,438
and using the same concepts.

819
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,542
You will often find that
when I do assessments,

820
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,610
I put out, ah, this
activity group,

821
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,146
I like the names
activity groups,

822
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,648
campaigns the mission focus,

823
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,783
but really at the core of
it, it's an activity group,

824
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,918
go read the Diamond Model,
do a two plus correlation

825
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,388
on unique trade craft
victims or infrastructure.

826
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,621
If you get a two
plus correlation,

827
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,890
you come up with
an activity group,

828
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,425
but it might not be
a unique adversary.

829
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,626
It doesn't matter.

830
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,828
The trade craft is
associated with them,

831
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,696
so you're defending
against that trade craft

832
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,197
to put you in a good position.

833
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,666
It doesn't matter if it's
different humans or not.

834
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,734
Okay, boom, there's like
day three of my intel class.

835
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:41,472
Alright, so when you come
up with this understanding

836
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,907
of activity groups,
you will see me do it,

837
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,475
and I hope you do it as well.

838
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,644
I actually do come
out and say, ah,

839
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,814
this group, this activity
group we're seeing

840
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,784
is operating in our
perceived understanding

841
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,485
of North Korean state interests.

842
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,121
Some of you might go, ah,

843
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,057
he just did attribution of
North Korea, no I didn't.

844
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,159
I'm saying the activity
group we're tracking

845
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,894
is operating in our perception

846
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,796
of North Korean state interests,

847
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,899
which means if you are
an American power company

848
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,500
and there is tension
between South Korea,

849
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,102
North Korea, and the US,

850
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,604
you might take
that activity group

851
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,173
and prioritize them
in your threat model

852
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,543
to go hunting for their trade
craft in your environments.

853
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,678
And in many cases
you will find them,

854
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,146
that's exactly what we
did when we found them.

855
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,815
Does it matter if they're
North Korea or not?

856
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,350
No.

857
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,285
They could be Syria and it has
no impact on anything for me,

858
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,954
because I did defense correctly.

859
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,389
I said here's my perception,

860
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,192
here's the model which
I've chosen to put this in,

861
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,828
I have made observations
and done assessments

862
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,597
to facilitate defense
in my environment,

863
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,166
and in many cases
it'll work for you.

864
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,935
Whether or not the
attribution is correct,

865
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,504
it doesn't matter,
don't get focused on it.

866
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,705
Well, I have to be correct.

867
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,441
Not for all defense
requirements.

868
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,844
There's some, but
for many you won't.

869
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:57,415
So in recap of my one slide
Little Bobby comic presentation,

870
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,218
understand your collection bias,

871
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,055
understand attribution
is generally hurtful,

872
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,390
not even helpful.

873
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,891
So if you're going
to do it, make sure

874
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,761
you actually have intelligence
requirements that demand it.

875
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,796
Understand that our
perception of adversary intent

876
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,798
is very much driven
on what we can see,

877
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,034
and there are usually
multiple intentions

878
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,535
going into any operation,

879
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,471
which limit the effectiveness
of our understanding of it,

880
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,408
so we have to focus on what
we need out of the situation,

881
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,644
go towards that, and make
sure it's actionable.

882
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,646
And on the back end of
that, I would make sure

883
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,882
that when we think
about activity groups,

884
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,184
I would suggest that
you get in the language

885
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,320
of here's my perception of
North Korean state interests,

886
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,554
or whatever, and this
is what we are seeing

887
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,090
in terms of the
victim targeting,

888
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,925
and how it matches our model.

889
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,194
But be intellectually
honest with yourselves,

890
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,263
and your customers,
and your consumers,

891
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,631
and that way we can get the
community to a better place,

892
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,200
without having little
twitter battles

893
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,469
and New York Times
arguments back and forth

894
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,870
with each other of
yes it's North Korea,

895
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,472
no it's not, well
the FBI has this,

896
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,673
well, there's classified.

897
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,308
Nothing about
sources and methods,

898
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,178
by the way, is accurate,
nothing makes it accurate.

899
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,047
It's top secret, does not
correlate to it's accurate,

900
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:04,849
it just means it was sensitive.

901
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,618
I've seen a lot of really
stupid top secret documents,

902
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,021
so let's focus on our
actual requirements,

903
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,889
move the community forward,
have a nuance to doing that,

904
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,158
and actually
understand that our job

905
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,827
at the end of the day is
to help our consumers,

906
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,161
not to feel good
about the position

907
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,796
which we got ourselves into.

908
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,864
Perfect, that's my talk.

909
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,533
(intense music)
