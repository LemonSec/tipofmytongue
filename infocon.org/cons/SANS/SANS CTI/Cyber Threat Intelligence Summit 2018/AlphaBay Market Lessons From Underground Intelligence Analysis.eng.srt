1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,645
(applause)

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,049
- I'm a threat intelligence
analyst at iDefense,

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,520
part of the Threat Hunting,
OSINT, and Reconnaissance team,

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,823
and we specialize
in targeted attacks

5
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,592
and underground research.

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,095
So this is my first time
here at SANS and at CTI,

7
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,430
so please be gentle,

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,766
but generally we're
gonna be talking about

9
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,668
the role that underground
intelligence plays

10
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,571
within part of a threat
intelligence program,

11
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,940
and we're gonna look at
it through the context

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,343
of a deep-dive look
at AlphaBay Market,

13
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,778
which was, until recently,

14
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,846
one of the largest criminal
underground markets.

15
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:53,019
So, for a background, I
really came into Threat Intel

16
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,854
by a quite an unorthodox route,

17
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:58,691
in that I don't have a
technical background.

18
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,393
I'm a massive tech geek,

19
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,028
which is unsurprising
in this venue,

20
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,230
but I came at this from a
War Studies perspective.

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,667
I've originally studied
under Thomas Red

22
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,638
doing intelligence
studies at grad school,

23
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,174
and I'm really passionate about

24
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:19,179
actually looking at
organizations and
how they function.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,682
So thinking about their
culture, their networks,

26
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,687
and what drives them, what are
their incentive structures,

27
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,723
and how does that help
us determine their future

28
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,859
and behavior as adversaries?

29
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,327
So, I'm gonna try
and show how we can

30
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,964
bring these aspects
together with threat intel.

31
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,502
So just as a baseline,
so everyone knows

32
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,702
what we're talking about

33
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,205
when we're talking
about underground intel.

34
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,507
Underground intel is probably
one of the oldest elements

35
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,876
of threat intelligence
in the sense

36
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,979
that there's always been
underground criminal communities

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,781
there have been people
trying to break into them.

38
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,418
So, some of you might have
read Mischa Glenny's book

39
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,621
on the topic Dark Markets,
which is essentially talking

40
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,556
about how the FBI infiltrated
English and Russian language

41
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,693
criminal communities
in the 2000s.

42
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,895
Yeah, this has been going
on for quite a long time.

43
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,297
And generally, you're using
underground intelligence

44
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,766
because you're trying
to provide visibility

45
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,567
into underground
criminal activity,

46
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,204
and what are the actors
actually planning there?

47
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,507
What's their intent?

48
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,308
What tool sets are they using?

49
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,043
And you know, what's
their future development?

50
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,747
And there's really
three main aspects

51
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,315
to underground intelligence,

52
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,584
and they obviously interrelated,

53
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,920
and they feed into each other.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,555
So, first of all, you
have human intelligence.

55
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,561
That's engaging with
actors directly,

56
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,064
trying to develop
sources, it's trying to

57
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,834
actually infiltrate the
communities in the first place

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,805
and developing a persona
through engaging these people.

59
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,608
Someone that they'll
recognize over time.

60
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,547
You're also conducting
open-source intelligence

61
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,550
you could be using Huis data,

62
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,587
you could be pulling
from social network data,

63
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,023
or you could be looking
into government records

64
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,492
and trying to tie people-
their digital identity

65
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,393
to their real world identities.

66
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,830
And then, finally, you have
classic cyber intelligence.

67
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,134
Indicate there's a compromise,
reverse-engineering malware,

68
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:25,404
and all of these things,
they feed together

69
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,941
and they're trying
to give you context

70
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,842
to inform your
defensive operations.

71
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:36,015
What are the pros and cons
of underground intelligence?

72
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,984
Here we're going to try and
actually do some real talk

73
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,287
as opposed to just
vendor speak about

74
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,523
what is the value of
underground intelligence,

75
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,656
because there is a lot.

76
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,429
First and foremost, you're
using underground intelligence

77
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,631
to try and get to
know your community.

78
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:56,269
Get to know the people who are
targeting your organization.

79
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,639
And this is primarily going to
be done by the cyber-criminal

80
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,541
underground of financially
motivated actors

81
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,744
because in all honesty,
there isn't a huge amount

82
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,781
of underground activity
surrounding cyber espionage.

83
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,451
There are in certain
communities in certain countries

84
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,686
and certain regions,
but generally

85
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,923
it's overwhelmingly financially
motivated cyber crime.

86
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,192
And what you're trying to do
is, you're trying to identify

87
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,762
the clusters of this
activity and trying to find

88
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,431
clusters of activity
that are most relevant

89
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,332
to your organization
or your vertical.

90
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:33,272
Now, ideally, what you want
is to be able to identify

91
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,376
activity at a
relatively early stage.

92
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,748
It could be, someone is trying
to put together a plan to

93
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,054
attack your organization,
they are trying to obtain

94
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,256
certain tools for it, and
that's the ideal scenario.

95
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,226
When you're coming in right
at the beginning and you're

96
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,428
starting to see a plot evolve.

97
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,966
But generally, a lot of what
you see is suboptimal outcome

98
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,702
which is actually, we're
seeing it right to the end.

99
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,472
Where we're seeing a
threat to the organization

100
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:11,477
in the form of someone
selling or spinning off

101
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,579
the results of their activity.

102
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,383
If you work in a financial,
and you've ever been part of

103
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,919
a fraud investigation team,
if you've ever spent any time

104
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,454
with cyber-criminal underground,

105
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,623
you're going to be seeing a
hell of a lot of this stuff.

106
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,926
People selling bank accounts,
people selling credentials

107
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,296
or whatever, but generally
that's often the most

108
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,899
highly visible aspect of
underground intelligence.

109
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:40,239
In terms of the value that
started off with the risk of

110
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,943
underground intelligence,
compared to other parts

111
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,844
of threat intelligence,
underground intelligence is

112
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,548
fairly high-risk,
in the sense that

113
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,485
this is a community that knows
that it's been infiltrated

114
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,420
a lot of the time, it's
not a secret anymore

115
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,923
that Brian Krebs is
hanging out in these places

116
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,759
and has many Russian pseudonyms.

117
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,863
There's a lot of journalists
as well as Krebs,

118
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,265
there's threat researchers,
and there's law enforcement

119
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,567
all over the place.

120
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,236
The people who form
these communities

121
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,505
know that their
infiltrated, you are part

122
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,040
of their threat profile.

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,708
Do not expect them to act,

124
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,043
unless they're
incredibly stupid,

125
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,277
which some of them are,

126
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,113
but generally do not
expect them to act

127
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,348
as if they don't know
they're being watched.

128
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,118
They know they're being
watched most of the time.

129
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:29,856
Actually, underground
intelligence is really tricky

130
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,158
because there is a huge
amount of activity out there.

131
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,395
There's thousands and
thousands of these sources

132
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,796
from different
levels in terms of

133
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,966
how easy they are to infiltrate

134
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,735
and how easy they
are to observe.

135
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,838
That has a big lift,
organizationally
and technically,

136
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,709
so you need to develop
a collection system

137
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,546
to grab all that data and
ingest it, make sense of it.

138
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,681
Often there's big language gaps,

139
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,849
obviously everyone
knows about how big

140
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,852
the Russian underground
is, but actually,

141
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,155
knowing Russian is
just the start of it.

142
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,123
There's a very
sophisticated dialect within

143
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,592
these communities that
takes time to get to know.

144
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,963
Of course, there's the
offset requirements

145
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,765
because you can't
just go into this

146
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,599
from your company's ASN.

147
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,669
You can't just go in
on a corporate machine.

148
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,772
You have to build
tooling that will let you

149
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,177
get into these communities
and if the box is compromised,

150
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,279
it doesn't come back
to your organization.

151
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,515
This is generally why
when people go for

152
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,151
underground intel,
they go for vendors,

153
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,154
because you're essentially
offsetting the risk

154
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,024
to a vendor, and there's
nothing wrong with that.

155
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,259
It's just the question
of how you use that

156
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,895
and are you realistic
about the utility of that?

157
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,900
A good way of thinking
about cyber criminality

158
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,270
is, think of it in terms
of its operational cycle.

159
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,205
This is similar, in a
way, to thinking about

160
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,074
the terrorist operational cycle,

161
00:07:55,074 --> 00:08:00,046
if any of you are from a
counter-terrorism background.

162
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:04,349
But generally, any normal
criminal will have to go

163
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,621
through these stages of
thinking about what they

164
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,657
actually want to do, how
they're going to do it,

165
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,626
what resources they need,
and then actually going

166
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,863
through and carrying out
the operation and then

167
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,664
carrying out the
exploitation at the end and

168
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,735
actually getting the financial
gain from that attack.

169
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,539
Generally what you
see is the top two.

170
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,075
If you're lucky, and you're
observing underground activity,

171
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,979
you can potentially see any
part of this attack cycle.

172
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,848
But realistically, you're
most likely gonna see

173
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,583
the very beginning,
the target selection,

174
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,554
and the very end,
the exploitation.

175
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:46,192
So that's something that the
vendor space has a problem with

176
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,294
is that it likes to
sell to people the idea

177
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,096
that it's going to give
you total visibility into

178
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,531
attacker activity and
you're going to be able to

179
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,632
see everything they're
doing and everything

180
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,065
they're talking about.

181
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,869
Realistically, the actors'
operational security

182
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,505
and also, in terms of what
they need from the underground

183
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,807
will mean that you will
not see that activity.

184
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,676
You're most likely going
to see the very beginning

185
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,510
and the very end.

186
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,515
Then we talk about
practical examples.

187
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:13,386
How should an organization
actually operationalize

188
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,387
underground intelligence?

189
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,925
This is going further
than just simply ingesting

190
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,993
underground data like a
feed, because that's entirely

191
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,563
the wrong way to use this.

192
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,465
Underground intelligence is
most valuable when you can

193
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:31,103
interact with the operation
cycle of cyber criminals

194
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,540
and then potentially
mitigate that threat.

195
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,711
Just say for example,
you're a global

196
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,915
hotel and resort operator,
maybe like this one.

197
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,486
You're trying to
identify clusters of TTPs

198
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,388
within particular
communities that you know

199
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,558
potentially could
harm your organization

200
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,694
based on your threat profile.

201
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,365
Then, ingested through
your underground feed,

202
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,467
or whatever your process is,

203
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,037
you see a guy who
claims to be an employee

204
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,307
of your organization,
and he's offering

205
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,910
inside access to the
customer payment system

206
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,776
for your company.

207
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,814
Not for your company, but
for an unspecified company.

208
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,717
Obviously, that would be
very interesting to you

209
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,352
if you were on a
threat intel team,

210
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,754
or if you're a part of
an instant response team.

211
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,156
The value here is when
you can actually reach out

212
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,195
to that actor and try and
work out, identify the threat.

213
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,631
What's the credibility
of the threat?

214
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,064
Does it relate to
your organization?

215
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,501
Does it relate to someone
else's organization?

216
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,837
And you can use
the three prongs,

217
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,106
you can use the
cyber intelligence,

218
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,476
trying to see if you can,
based on the conversation

219
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,778
with the actor, can you
isolate which machine

220
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,279
is being compromised?

221
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,982
Or are you able to use
OSINT, are you able to

222
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,117
see if the actor, you manage
to get them to provide

223
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,520
a screenshot demonstrating
their access,

224
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,255
because you're pretending
like you're interested

225
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,390
in buying it.

226
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,891
Then you can
potentially geo-locate

227
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,392
the office that's
been compromised

228
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,294
based on the photo data.

229
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,898
This is all very
practical and can be done.

230
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,969
This is what the value of
underground intelligence is

231
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,805
actually about identifying
and mitigating a threat

232
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,107
at the earliest stage
you possibly can,

233
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,310
rather than just observing
something and noting it.

234
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,582
Now we can talk
about the fun stuff.

235
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,585
Why are we talking
about AlphaBay?

236
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:31,123
AlphaBay is a really
interesting criminal market.

237
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:35,227
It was originally founded
in December 2014 by a guy

238
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,329
called Alpha02,
that was his handle.

239
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,734
We now know that his real
name was Alexandre Cazes.

240
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,503
He was a French-Canadian guy
from the Quebec province.

241
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,008
AlphaBay is very interesting
because it wasn't just

242
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,444
trying to be like any
other marketplace.

243
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,145
It was trying to do
something different.

244
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:58,117
It was trying to combine a
Silk Road style marketplace

245
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,255
with a much wider nexus
of criminal activity.

246
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,790
It was trying to plug
in a quite sophisticated

247
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,595
very large, mostly
English-speaking criminal

248
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,565
community with this marketplace.

249
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,633
And it was very
successful in doing that.

250
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,937
By around June of
2017, we saw about

251
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:22,641
190,000 registered members
on the forum alone.

252
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,081
We took a look at AlphaBay
and decided that this would be

253
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,418
a great target for a
strategic research project,

254
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,754
strategic underground
intelligence collection.

255
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,422
Because what we really
wanted to understand

256
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,790
was how the market worked,

257
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,824
and how did that relate
to our customers?

258
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,329
It was really good fun.

259
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,164
AlphaBay is actually a
really interesting place

260
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,899
to hang out, who'd've thought?

261
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,770
It was a really good
community to spend time in.

262
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,905
You learn a huge amount
about how the criminals

263
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,107
actually operated,
how they thought,

264
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,677
what they're interested
in, and we managed

265
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,047
to complete the project and
publish it on our platform

266
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:06,318
about a day before it was
taken down by law enforcement.

267
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,819
So, we got lucky.

268
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,825
Generally, AlphaBay, it was
split into these two components.

269
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,728
You had the primary marketplace,

270
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,763
the image is a bit blurry,
but on the left you can see

271
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:23,068
this is search results
for the malware section.

272
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,471
There was a specific
malware subsection.

273
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,909
Most Silk Road style
marketplaces do have malware,

274
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,645
but AlphaBay was
interesting in that it had

275
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,848
arguably the most sophisticated
and largest offering

276
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,950
of malware on any tor
accessible marketplace.

277
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,823
In addition to that, it
had the forum section,

278
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,793
which was far busier and more
lively and more sophisticated

279
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,596
than any other forum section
of any other marketplace.

280
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:57,069
What happened to AlphaBay
is basically, suddenly,

281
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,439
it just dropped off the
radar. It went dead.

282
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,208
The website stopped resolving.

283
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,543
Absolutely no one
knew what had happened

284
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,782
and there was an effort by
the community to try and

285
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,750
reach out to staff and
find out what on Earth has

286
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,520
gone wrong, disappeared
with all our money.

287
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:20,626
The AlphaBay staff members
were, some of the junior

288
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,861
staff members were saying

289
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,297
"Don't worry, it's fine.
We're doing upgrades."

290
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,268
And after some days had
passed, everyone was just like

291
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,771
"It looks like they've just
gone, they've exit scammed,

292
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,574
they've ran off with
all the deposited cash,

293
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,444
so we're just going
to go to Hansa."

294
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,548
Hansa was the second
biggest market at the time,

295
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,218
and was pretty sophisticated
in its own right as well.

296
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,522
What people didn't realize
is that these people

297
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,558
were being steered into a trap.

298
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:57,229
Because Hansa was being
operated as a honeypot

299
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,266
by the Dutch national
police who'd seized it

300
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,568
about a month before.

301
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,137
As thousands of users
started migrating from

302
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:10,141
AlphaBay to Hansa,
often in quite a rush,

303
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,079
they were giving the
Dutch police a huge amount

304
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,515
of metadata on the users.

305
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,250
They were just
sucking people up.

306
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:24,089
On July 20th of 2017,
in a joint conference,

307
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,228
police at the Dutch FBI
snapped the trap shut,

308
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,031
announced both markets
had been seized and

309
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:37,870
it sent absolute shock
through the community

310
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,004
that this had happened.

311
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,340
The idea of one
marketplace going down,

312
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,809
that's the game,
that's how this goes.

313
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,145
But two marketplaces
at the same time,

314
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,213
in a coordinated
operation, no one thought

315
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,647
the police were that smart.

316
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,620
How do we actually
get to that place?

317
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,291
Well, it turns out that while
Cazes and his crew had run

318
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,460
a pretty tight shop, it
was a pretty sophisticated

319
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,430
marketplace in terms of
operational security as well,

320
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,998
it also made a pretty
crucial mistake

321
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,835
at a pretty early stage of
setting up the marketplace.

322
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,671
Cazes had actually sent
out a "Welcome to AlphaBay"

323
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,041
registration email and,
buried in the headers

324
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,411
of that registration email,
it had the email address

325
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,547
"pimpalex_91@hotmail.com".

326
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,018
So once the FBI saw that,

327
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,620
I think it was about two
years later they found that,

328
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,790
there was collective
head-slapping all around.

329
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,693
And the whole business
started to untangle.

330
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,896
They managed to locate
his server farm in Canada,

331
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:42,067
in his hometown, which,
again, pretty disappointing.

332
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:47,072
And when they raided
his house in Thailand,

333
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,375
he was living in
Thailand at that point,

334
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,910
they actually found
everything laying out

335
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,444
in plain text on his computer.

336
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,080
Absolutely everything.

337
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,752
The crown jewels,
all the wallet, all
the keys, everything.

338
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,387
And, just for future
recommendations,

339
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,223
if anyone here is thinking
about running a marketplace

340
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,560
in the future, I wouldn't
recommend having a personal

341
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,163
net worth document
stretching out

342
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,098
all your assets around the world

343
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,568
on the same computer that you
run your criminal marketplace.

344
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,905
Pro-tip.

345
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,374
But, do you know who did
exactly the same thing?

346
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,709
Dread Pirate Roberts.

347
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,577
He did exactly the same thing.

348
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,479
The Silk Road founded
exactly the same way.

349
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,949
I can't even, I just
don't understand.

350
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,087
What does AlphaBay actually
tell us about underground intel

351
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,326
and why underground
intelligence is used for?

352
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,164
So what we've found is
that AlphaBay gave us

353
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,133
a huge amount of visibility
into the actual operational

354
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:53,138
planning of a big network
of cyber criminal operators

355
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,408
in the English language, who
tended to be in the kind of

356
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:01,112
low-skill, in English we would
call them like barrow boys,

357
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:05,717
people who are just trying to
find any kind of job they can

358
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,152
to make a bit of cash,

359
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,888
to people who are
marginally sophisticated or

360
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,292
are fairly specialized in
certain areas of fiscal fraud.

361
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,929
But there's also a pretty
strong relationship between

362
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,934
AlphaBay and the Russian
underground community as well.

363
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,235
AlphaBay was actually
acting as a bridge

364
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,138
between these two communities.

365
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,174
And that was a deliberate
decision by the operators

366
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,642
of the marketplace,
who were actually

367
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,579
pretty sophisticated cyber
criminals in their own right.

368
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,315
Again, this is something
that distinguishes AlphaBay

369
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:41,320
from other markets, in that
AlphaBay is run by- was run by a

370
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,690
coterie of really
spphisticated cyber criminals.

371
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,127
People who had years od
experience, and they knew

372
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,595
exactly what they were doing.

373
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,831
Further evidence of their
sophistication is their

374
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,601
financial model, which we
found significant evidence

375
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,572
to suggest that AlphaBay was
more than just a marketplace,

376
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,242
it was actually a multi-tier
financial scam involving

377
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,843
crypto-currency manipulation.

378
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,212
We're going to be talking about
that in a bit more detail.

379
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,949
This phrase I think
really helps encapsulate

380
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,152
what the scene of
AlphaBay was like, in that

381
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,355
it felt like Reddit, but
it was for criminals.

382
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,060
It was highly social, it was
full of people just talking

383
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,498
absolute nonsense most of
the time, coming up with

384
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,134
the most ridiculous ideas
on how to make money.

385
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,170
I remember seeing one
guy asking for help

386
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,907
trying for someone to come and
chop down his neighbor's tree

387
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,774
because he didn't want
to be caught doing it.

388
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,610
Just totally bonkers
stuff like that.

389
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,615
But generally, you had a
really wide selection of people

390
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,553
with different skillsets all
trying to find each other

391
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,522
and then potentially make some
money out of that partnership

392
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,958
You had people like the
insiders, so there was quite

393
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,095
a lot of people offering
insider services to banks

394
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:01,667
or to retailers, "I can
hook you up, get past fraud

395
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,369
protection systems."

396
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,439
And you also had people
who were offering,

397
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,678
they could set you up
a fraudulent company,
a front company

398
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,613
to launder stolen money through.

399
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,884
You had people who specialized
in business email compromise.

400
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,419
Really wide skillset.

401
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,422
And obviously a lot of them
were idiots, but still,

402
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,824
a significant
contingence were good.

403
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:32,164
Now, an example of the kind
of tactical output that

404
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,633
you got from these
kinds of interactions,

405
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,969
and just by getting to
know the community there

406
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,705
and interacting with them,
we were actually contacted

407
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,376
by a criminal gang based
in the south of Europe .

408
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:48,680
What they were, they were
a physical criminal gang,

409
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,016
like a regular good
old-fashioned criminal gang.

410
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,986
And what they were looking
for on AlphaBay was someone

411
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,555
who could hook them
up with some malware.

412
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:00,993
So they had physical access
to several companies' internal

413
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,796
networks, we think that they
may have been contractors

414
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,100
or may have people in as
contractors within the company.

415
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,334
What they were trying to do
is find someone who could

416
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,106
provide malware for them
that then they could install

417
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,409
into those networks using
their insider access

418
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:21,313
and then they can expel
all the data out, sell it,

419
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,783
then profit would be split
with the specialist who

420
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,584
could provide them
with the malware.

421
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,322
Pretty interesting stuff.

422
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,494
Based on this interaction,
where we were able to speak

423
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:40,197
with the actors and get
to know them and pin down

424
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,267
what they were trying
to do, then we're able

425
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,303
to pass that intelligence
off to the companies

426
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,671
who are actually being targeted.

427
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,206
Now, because this
is a public talk,

428
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,676
we've had to change some
details to protect the victims,

429
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,245
but generally, this is
the gist of what happened.

430
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,183
That's the point is
that, it's going beyond-

431
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,219
if we had simply reported
that we'd seen some people

432
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,589
looking to buy malware, that
wouldn't be very interesting,

433
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,192
so all the steps beyond that
of actually reaching out

434
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,261
and connecting the actors,
working out what they want .

435
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,862
That gives you the killer piece.

436
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,367
So the Russian
connection of AlphaBay

437
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,101
is a really interesting one

438
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,539
and not just for the
first reason I outlined

439
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,441
in terms of a bridge, but also,

440
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:26,445
they were trying to use
their connection to Russia

441
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,146
as an OPSEC measure.

442
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,449
So, explain a bit
how that worked.

443
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,319
First of all, they would
tell people that sale of

444
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,324
Russian personal data
and financial data

445
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,427
was banned on the market,
that you couldn't sell it

446
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,261
on the market.

447
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,434
Also, they regularly reached
out to people on the Russian

448
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,872
underground saying "this
is a great place to hawk

449
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,376
to English speakers."

450
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,811
We actually saw direct
evidence of them reaching out

451
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,080
on some top tier Russian
underground forums saying

452
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,316
"Come to AlphaBay, it's a
really good place to sell

453
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,951
in both English and Russian."

454
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,788
But something doesn't
make sense here,

455
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,992
because we know now that
Cazes was based in Canada,

456
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,629
or at least his
infrastructure was,

457
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,097
and he lived in Thailand,

458
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:23,602
so why were they trying to
ban the sale of Russian data?

459
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,036
There's a common characteristic
of a lot of Russian

460
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,272
underground forums.

461
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,107
So what we think they
were trying to do is

462
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,810
pose as that they
were based in Russia,

463
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,413
they were trying to
essentially mislead people

464
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,748
that they were based in Russia.

465
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,753
This is the tagline for the
admin account run by Cazes.

466
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,423
It says in Russian, I can't
speak in Russian, so I'm

467
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,258
butchering it, but
it means basically

468
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,026
"Be careful, brothers."

469
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,695
Ooh, spooky Russian mafia.

470
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,230
Very interesting.

471
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,202
I think, ultimately, they're
playing a double game here,

472
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,071
because they're trying
to persuade everyone that

473
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,872
"Yeah, we're spooky
Russian mafia, don't bother

474
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,375
coming after us
because we've located

475
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,976
all our infrastructure
in Russia."

476
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,579
They actually explicitly
said that on the forum

477
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,849
several times, that we now
know is likely to be untrue.

478
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,221
But we think that there also
was quite a strong relationship

479
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:21,226
between the admins and the
staff, and the CIS region,

480
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,063
the Russian Commonwealth of
Independent States region.

481
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,732
Some evidence suggests that
several of the staff members

482
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,136
were based there, or had
been based there originally,

483
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,404
and did speak Russian.

484
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,610
AlphaBay's financial model
is particularly interesting

485
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,414
and sophisticated in
comparison to it's adversaries,

486
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,015
or competitors, rather,

487
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:48,487
in that it incorporated
the usual Escrow system

488
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:53,158
for a market, but in
addition, it had an automated

489
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,760
credit card shop, so
if you've ever seen any

490
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,064
usual credit card auto shops
like Joker Stash or whatever,

491
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,266
it had one of those
built into the market

492
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,936
for the credit card sellers,
bulk credit card sellers.

493
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,239
It also had a mixer built
into it, so you could

494
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,276
mix your crypto-currency
within the site without

495
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,112
having to use an
additional service.

496
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,215
But that wasn't the end of it.

497
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,952
The marketplace was part
of a wider financial model,

498
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,654
and they were very
explicit about this.

499
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:27,659
This is a direct quote from
AlphaBay's support account

500
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,562
on Reddit, because they
maintained several accounts

501
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,098
on Reddit, just to keep in
touch with their buyers,

502
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,233
explaining why "Don't worry,
AlphaBay's not going to

503
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,536
exit scam because we
have a much better idea."

504
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,733
We think we've identified
at least one root as to

505
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,967
how they were doing this.

506
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,640
AlphaBay was pretty
innovative in that it was one

507
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,676
of the first currencies
to support a multitude

508
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,579
of alternative cryptocurrencies
in addition to Bitcoin.

509
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,317
They ended up adopting
two coins successfully,

510
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,787
and it looks like they weren't
able to complete the third

511
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,990
coin integration at the end
because they were seized.

512
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,995
They actually managed to
integrate Monero and Ethereum

513
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,698
and then didn't
manage to do ZCash.

514
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,935
What we think that
they were doing was,

515
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,905
they were using the marketplace
and the trade within

516
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,308
the marketplace to actually
try and influence the value

517
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,777
of the coins themselves.

518
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,113
We think the strategy
went something like this.

519
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,716
In the first step, you buy
a lot of cryptocurrency

520
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,085
that wasn't currently supported
by any major marketplaces.

521
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:04,823
It, at the time, was
relatively obscure

522
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,425
on the criminal underground.

523
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,195
And then, what you do
after that is tell people

524
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,063
AlphaBay is now supporting
this coin, and you should

525
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,767
totally look at trading it,
because this is obviously

526
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,268
going to affect
the coin's value.

527
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,771
Then you see people start
shooting into the market

528
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,108
as people start to see a
movement into the market.

529
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,043
The currency is now supported
among the underground.

530
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,313
And congratulations, you
just pumped up the currency

531
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,648
that you previously bought.

532
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,418
One example of where
we think they did this

533
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,152
is with the coin Monero.

534
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,123
Monero is pretty massive now
on the underground, it's a

535
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,592
really popular underground coin,

536
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,928
partly because it's relatively
easy to mine with GPUs.

537
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,631
It's really popular
with miner malware

538
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,235
and it's also staring to be
integrated into ransomware.

539
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:55,907
It's a coin that's trying to
be harder to track than Bitcoin

540
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,641
It's trying to improve on a
lot of the benefits to Bitcoin

541
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,151
for criminal underground uses.

542
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,154
Before AlphaBay adopted it,
it was relatively obscure.

543
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:15,226
Around August 18th, the market
cap was about 28 million.

544
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,564
There's also not much trading
activity, it's pretty quiet.

545
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:24,569
On August 21st, a market
called Oasis Market,

546
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,373
which is smaller drug-focused
market, announces support.

547
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,710
That's interesting, they're
the first ones to come in.

548
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,712
There's a little bit
of change in the price,

549
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,146
but not really that much.

550
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,917
Now, on August 22nd,
AlphaBay announces support

551
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,120
for the coin, and at
the same time, they say,

552
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,856
they said this
specifically on the forum,

553
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,293
"This is a really good
time to invest in Monero."

554
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,396
No winky face, but you can
imagine the winky face.

555
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:56,334
And as the coin is integrated
into marketplace and completed

556
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,137
there's a huge
amount of trading.

557
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,772
After that announcement,
there was something like

558
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:05,777
$61M of trade in 24-hours,
that's one estimate from a guy.

559
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,547
By the time they had
completed the integration,

560
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,783
the value's over triple.

561
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:16,754
Over 300% increase in
the value of currency.

562
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,692
I think Monero now
is worth about $5B

563
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:24,863
so if you invested, based
on an AlphaBay coin pick,

564
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,131
you did pretty well.

565
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:32,704
If you spent any time on
AlphaBay, you might recognize

566
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:37,709
this guy's distinctive turn
of phrase and unique voice.

567
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,147
This is someone who is a quite
prominent voice on the forum.

568
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,049
He called this out at the
time, this was at the time

569
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,051
of ZCash integration.

570
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:50,688
As you can see, he says

571
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,984
So, at least I'm not
the only one saying it.

572
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,187
This is actually an
asset forfeiture notice

573
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:28,193
that was released when AlphaBay,
when Cazes was indicted

574
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,029
and AlphaBay was shut down.

575
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,566
This is just Cazes's
personal holdings, this is

576
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,535
not associated with the wallet
infrastructure for AlphaBay,

577
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,437
just from his personal wallets,

578
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:44,141
he had 1,605 Bitcoin,

579
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,044
8,309 Ethereum,

580
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,313
3,691 Zcash,

581
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,648
and an unknown number of Monero.

582
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:51,916
They weren't able to work out

583
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,283
how much Monero he actually had.

584
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,754
Advertise the currency or
not, make your mind up.

585
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,927
There is some evidence
that he was engaging

586
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,995
in personal trading
of the same currencies

587
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,332
the marketplace was supporting.

588
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,768
This is the rough
valuation as of Sunday now,

589
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,170
how much that was worth.

590
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,341
He did alright, he
did pretty well.

591
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,310
So, what does AlphaBay
actually tell us about

592
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,111
underground intelligence?

593
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,749
If you spend time in
these communities,

594
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,751
get to know these communities,

595
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:30,622
you can learn a huge
amount about the intent

596
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,025
of cyber criminals
and the development

597
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:37,495
of their techniques,
tactics, and procedures.

598
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:42,166
It's a powerful capability,
but it's a limited capability

599
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,569
because you will
never see all of it.

600
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,671
You will only ever
see a partial picture.

601
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:52,877
It is something that should
be incorporated into any

602
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:56,981
mature threat
intelligence program.

603
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,484
There's no shame
about using a vendor.

604
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:03,120
This is something tricky,
and it's hard to scale.

605
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,691
Fundamentally, my message here
is to try and go out there

606
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,559
and get to know your community.

607
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,597
Get to know cyber
criminals that you identify

608
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,532
as likely to target
your vertical

609
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,001
or likely to target
your organization

610
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:21,572
and that will really help
inform your threat profile.

611
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:25,677
Potentially, help
resolve an incident.

612
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,880
Thanks very much, and if
you have any questions,

613
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,716
hit me up.

614
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,052
(applause)
