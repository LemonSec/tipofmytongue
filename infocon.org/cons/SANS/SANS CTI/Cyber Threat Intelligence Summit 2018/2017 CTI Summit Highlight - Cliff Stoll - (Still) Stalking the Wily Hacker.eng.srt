1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:11,309
why do we still work on this problem why

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:14,940
do we care and to me this is the point

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,830
this is the torch that I feel is in each

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,439
of your hands because it's no longer in

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,470
my hands we care because we're members

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,948
of a community and it's a community not

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,509
bound together by databases it's not a

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,150
community that's bound together

9
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:32,969
by knowing how Python scripts use

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,730
dictionary lookups it's not a community

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,320
that's that is bound together because oh

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,930
we know how to do this intrusion

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,379
detection we know how to do Wireshark

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:47,640
know it's a community tied together by

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,620
common interests of promoting the three

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,769
or the not so free transfer of

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,660
information legitimately between our

18
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:56,160
different individuals our different

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,870
organizations our different companies

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,390
our different universities this is our

21
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:06,649
responsibility this is who we are this

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,650
is who we should be
