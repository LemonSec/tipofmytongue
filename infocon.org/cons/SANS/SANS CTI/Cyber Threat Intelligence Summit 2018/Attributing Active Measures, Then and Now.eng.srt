1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,570
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,778
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,417
- In 2017, last year
my summer project

4
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:22,022
was something
that, there will be

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,857
very little cyber in this talk.

6
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,894
So just to introduce,
last summer my project

7
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:31,964
was to something that
historians at least,

8
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,700
I find very exciting.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,236
I took the entire CIA
archives that is publicly

10
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,004
on their website and we're
looking at approximately

11
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,208
600 gigabytes of pdf files.

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,278
And I was working
with the archive a lot

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:49,382
for my book and I was so
annoyed at the OCR'ing

14
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,683
of the pdf files.

15
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,186
It's really bad and
the search interface

16
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,155
that they have is also very bad.

17
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,957
It was practically
unusable, the archive.

18
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,794
So I decided to
download the whole thing

19
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,096
and re-OCR it and now
I have this amazing

20
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:08,967
search tool into the CIA
archive that allows me

21
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,604
to pull out information on
very specific operations

22
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,008
in a highly targeted
and very productive way.

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,744
So what I will present
today is sort of completely

24
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:23,416
fresh historical research
that used a little bit

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,720
of that capability but
mainly other sources.

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,622
Most of them open
but not all of them.

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,327
So let me pull up my
slide right here, sorry.

28
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,833
The operation that
I'm going to present

29
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,667
is a vintage operation.

30
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:46,539
It took place in 1959, 1960
and there's a little bit

31
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,676
of a technical component
to it at the end

32
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,379
but basically the
question is what I'm doing

33
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:58,351
is I'm going to attribute
or explain the attribution

34
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,889
of one of the most
extraordinary and most damaging

35
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,756
active measures of all time.

36
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,327
It's truly an absolutely
stunning operation

37
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,895
and the fact that
most likely, in fact

38
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:11,930
I'd be really curious
whether that is correct,

39
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,566
but most likely
nobody in this room

40
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,468
has ever heard of
this operation before,

41
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,703
shows you how successful it was.

42
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,274
It doesn't really
have a code name

43
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,675
and we don't know
it's actual code name.

44
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,744
It's a KGB operation
so let's call it

45
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,780
Operation Swastika and
as I said it started

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,718
in 1959 on Christmas Day
but I'll walk you through

47
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,387
the operation in great
detail in just a moment.

48
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:38,324
So quick questions for
today, what happened?

49
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,194
How did the attribution work?

50
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,095
How good was the evidence?

51
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,166
The old question that
shows up, comes up

52
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,668
again and again.

53
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,938
And especially, what did
we learn from this case?

54
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,472
'Cause in some cases,
this is very much

55
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,808
a back to the
future type scenario

56
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:59,512
and think you'll find
out why in just a moment.

57
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,484
So the story starts in September
1959, actually a few months

58
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,488
earlier but we
don't know this yet.

59
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:15,094
This is a picture of the
Synagogue in Cologne, Germany.

60
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,864
The Synagogue had
just been reopened.

61
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,533
It was reopened in
September by the Chancellor,

62
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,102
by the German Chancellor at
the time Konrad Adenauer,

63
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,707
in a bit of vintage dress
here, giving the opening speech

64
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,311
in the Synagogue.

65
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,379
That was a huge event
sort of front page news

66
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,781
all over the country
because, you know,

67
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:40,220
obviously this is 14,
15 years after the end

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,722
of World War II and
after the Holocaust.

69
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,325
So this is a very
important part of Germany

70
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,161
coming to terms with its
own very dark past here.

71
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:53,399
Two months later on
Christmas Day 1959,

72
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,937
a student walks home
after a night out,

73
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,940
Christmas Mass and a few
drinks and he walks past

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,676
the Synagogue in the
middle of the night

75
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,178
and discovers this.

76
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:09,515
He discovers swastikas
smeared on the walls

77
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:14,519
of the Synagogue and you know,
(speaking German) Jews Out.

78
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,791
Anti-Semitic incident in
a very high profile locale

79
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,226
that had just been
reopened by the Chancellor.

80
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,397
And of course, Cologne
and the entire country

81
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,001
react immediately
this becomes again,

82
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,536
front page news
in every newspaper

83
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,672
across the entire country.

84
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,642
The following day there's
another incident in Cologne

85
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,712
and then a day later
more incidents pop up

86
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,215
in different German cities.

87
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,885
And over the course of six
weeks, until mid February,

88
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,391
we count only
inside West Germany,

89
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,128
833 anti-Semitic incidents, 833.

90
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,931
There is letters sent to
Jewish business people

91
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,236
or Jewish just
individuals, swastikas,

92
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,673
hate slogans, et cetera.

93
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,608
And this is a map that
one of the newspapers

94
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,576
published at the time
of all the incidents

95
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,711
happening in Germany.

96
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,548
Some of you will notice that
it extends beyond Germany

97
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:20,553
and indeed we see, you
know, smear graffitis

98
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,389
like this pop up
all across Europe

99
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,726
and in fact across
the entire planet.

100
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:31,731
The, let's just quickly
go back, the operation

101
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,802
extends the smearings
show up as far away

102
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:40,373
as Melbourne, Rhodesia,
across the United States

103
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,875
in 13 different cities,
in the UK, in France,

104
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,011
in almost every single
European country.

105
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,685
And the government in
Bonne, this is a picture

106
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,956
of Bonne at the time, even
did a timeline analysis

107
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,259
and came up with a
bunch of statistics

108
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,594
just to understand
what was going on.

109
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,030
And here we can see
the 833 incidents

110
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,835
over time they peaked
around January 5th,

111
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:12,138
6th, 7th, 8th actually
in different countries.

112
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,674
So some people at the
time already suspected

113
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,844
that this is moving
so quickly and such a

114
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,547
global phenomenon, in
many countries the slogans

115
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,518
that showed up at walls
were actually in German

116
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,388
so you would have, you
know, (speaking German)

117
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,291
printed in German on
synagogues in New York

118
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,627
and Australia, which was
a little bit suspicious.

119
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,929
Why suddenly in
German everywhere?

120
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,000
So here are a few
pictures from New York

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,937
at the time, 1960
early 1960, this is the

122
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:49,942
Temple Emmanuel on Fifth
Avenue, which also was smeared.

123
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,379
This is a swastika
from the Temple.

124
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,948
This is another picture
from the United States.

125
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,152
A swastika at the wall of
a student fraternity house.

126
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,722
I think it was in Michigan
if I got my details right

127
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,258
off the top of my head.

128
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,193
Now, why do I show
you these pictures?

129
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,696
It's a fascinating
little detail here

130
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,633
because the, this is
a quick fast forward,

131
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,503
the one on the right
with the policeman

132
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,441
at the Temple Emmanuel
on Fifth Avenue

133
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,945
was a Russian operative painting
the swastika at the wall.

134
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,314
The other one was
as far as we know,

135
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,918
most likely a genuine
anti-Semitic student.

136
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,923
Now basically, one is fake and
one is factual if you like.

137
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,061
Now, clearly it becomes a
little bit of a mute question

138
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,530
which one's fake and
which one's factual

139
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,732
and indeed it is extremely
difficult to break down

140
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:52,738
the numbers and say how
many of the graffitis

141
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,274
and other little
incidents that happened

142
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,477
were actually done by
somebody who was doing it

143
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,113
for because they were paid
or instigated to do so

144
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,116
as opposed to actually
believed in it.

145
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,919
I'll have more on
that in just a moment.

146
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,090
January 7th in the UK,
just a picture from Leeds

147
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,626
to show you have evasive
it was and I could go on

148
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,462
but of course the
image material,

149
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,364
some of this is
imagery, by the way,

150
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,931
is super hard to track down.

151
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:24,937
So, I'll stop now with
that and of course,

152
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,240
the reaction was intense.

153
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,376
In Berlin you had on
January 8th at the height

154
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:34,380
of the campaign you
had a demonstration

155
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,650
of approximately 40,000
people taking to the streets

156
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,988
demonstrating against
neo-Nazi tendency

157
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,991
against anti-Semitism
in Germany.

158
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,461
A day later or a
week later actually,

159
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:52,465
demonstrations in London,
huge demonstrations.

160
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,402
50,000 people, five
zero, take to the streets

161
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,971
in London and march
on the German Embassy

162
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,741
and you have this rise
of anti-German sentiment,

163
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,609
in the UK, in the U.S.

164
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,712
The press coverage
of the operation,

165
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,649
I've just given you a few
snippets here from Germany.

166
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,719
These are all front
pages, only front pages

167
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,290
from other countries,
this is one from the UK

168
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,992
of a newspaper that doesn't
exist anymore, The Guardian.

169
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,964
I think there were well
more than 1,000 articles

170
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,199
written only within the
space of a few weeks

171
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,568
on this incident.

172
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,136
It was absolutely
massive at the time.

173
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:36,375
In Germany, the perspective
on the operation

174
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,713
was, I'll sum it up
by saying in Germany

175
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,684
the perspective was,
you know, this is only

176
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:49,055
a few bad apples,
possibly very early on,

177
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,123
some suspicions were
articulated that this

178
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,494
may be Communist inspired
but the allegation

179
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,862
didn't really fly.

180
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,497
So in Germany this
perspective was that this is

181
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,034
the problem that we
basically have under control

182
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,304
and will disappear if we
tackle it in the right way.

183
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,608
And Germany did a lot
of things to tackle

184
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,209
the rise of anti-Semitism,
working with schools,

185
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,946
working with
teachers, et cetera.

186
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:18,084
But, outside Germany,
the perspective,

187
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,719
perception was very different.

188
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,023
This is a cartoon from
the NY Times at the time

189
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:28,928
and you know, the person
on the right, this guy

190
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:33,833
is Adenauer the German
Chancellor and what you see

191
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,669
is Germany is in the
sick bed, you know,

192
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,638
Germany really doesn't
look very great here

193
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,705
in that cartoon.

194
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,943
So the reputational
damage for the country,

195
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,679
for West Germany, was
absolutely massive.

196
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,348
So, the operation was
extremely effective.

197
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:55,054
I think it's beyond
any done, considering

198
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,122
the amount of press
coverage it generated.

199
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,160
And also just, I mean
you know, the Israeli

200
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,362
Minister of Justice at
the time for example,

201
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,897
spoke about it in
front of the Knesset,

202
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,335
the Bundestag and the
German cabinet had special

203
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,204
emergency meetings on
this, several times.

204
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,539
I mean it was a huge deal.

205
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,545
So, I'll speak about the
attribution of the incident

206
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,351
in now for a few minutes
but before I do so,

207
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,688
just to give you a chance
to throw a question at me

208
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,992
or comments, any
questions so far?

209
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,794
Yes sir.

210
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,997
- [Male] Was there any signs
of being behind (inaudible)?

211
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:45,071
- I appreciate the question,
it's a brilliant question.

212
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,440
In fact, sorry, I'll
repeat the question.

213
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,276
Question is was there
any, if I heard right,

214
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,012
the question was, was there
any symptom or any sign

215
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,381
of anti-Semitism of the
same type of problem

216
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,983
on the other side of
the Iron Curtain, right?

217
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,484
- [Male] Right.

218
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,189
- I forgot that
detail, thank you.

219
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,028
The answer is almost
none except East Berlin.

220
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,864
Berlin was the hotspot
of this operation.

221
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,034
And at the time, and
this happens very early

222
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:20,039
in January, anti-Semitic
incidents begin appearing

223
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,975
in East Berlin and the
authorities in East Berlin

224
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,111
obviously these are,
you know, communists

225
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,146
is that the wall isn't
up yet in Berlin.

226
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,049
This is '59, the wall
gets built a year,

227
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,752
a good year later in '61.

228
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,755
So there's a lot of
traffic, easy traffic

229
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,723
between East and West Berlin.

230
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,493
So the, essentially
the problem, backfires

231
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,330
into East Berlin and
within the same time frame

232
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,335
we have approximately 220
anti-Semitic incidents

233
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,771
in East Berlin as
well, which of course,

234
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,174
the authorities
tried to suppress.

235
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,976
They didn't want to admit
this because in their own

236
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,212
ideology they were
very much anti-fascist.

237
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,083
So yeah, that is a
fascinating detail.

238
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,084
We only know this from
archives and that opened

239
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,753
much, much later.

240
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,889
At the time, it was
difficult to assess.

241
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,858
This was a great question,
is there another question

242
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,194
like this? (giggling)

243
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,830
Okay I'll move on.

244
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,233
There will be a little
bit of time for Q & A.

245
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,170
What you see here, the
person you see here

246
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,939
on this picture is
Franz Josef Strauss.

247
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,944
He was the, at the time, the
Bavarian Minister of Defense

248
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,550
in Germany and he was
one of the first people

249
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,822
to make public a report of
the Bundesnachrichtendienst,

250
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,358
the German Foreign
Intelligence Agency,

251
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,959
which was brand new at the time.

252
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,930
Still called Organization
Gehlen at the time

253
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:56,936
and the intelligence
that he revealed first

254
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,773
and it was later
revealed in more detail,

255
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,977
was that in a meeting of
the East German government,

256
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,911
so the gentleman
that you can see here

257
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,416
on the right is Walter Ulbricht.

258
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,820
He is the Head of State, the
Chairman of the Socialist Party

259
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,791
East Germany, he here
in a conversation

260
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,796
with Khrushchev, he chaired
a meeting in January 1959,

261
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,334
so approximately a year
before the operation started

262
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,103
in which it was decided
to try to instigate

263
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:36,108
neo-Nazi hate crimes in Germany

264
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,044
through covert operators.

265
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,146
And they made that
decision, obviously

266
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,748
in a confidential
and a secret meeting.

267
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,186
But Bundesnachrichtendienst
revealed that detail

268
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,890
about the meeting,
which, you know,

269
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,093
I think is a highly
significant, highly significant

270
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,963
expression of intent.

271
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,531
But then what happened
next is interesting,

272
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,799
'cause a lot of
people in the press

273
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,968
and in fact inside the
German government said

274
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,906
this may sound familiar,
said well, okay.

275
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,440
We had that meeting, we had
the anti-Semitic incident

276
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,945
that just happened
but how do we know

277
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,514
there's actually a
connection between the two?

278
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,117
Like, okay we have an
expression of intent,

279
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,620
we have an incident
that is a perfect fit,

280
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,589
but then of course,
the next you know,

281
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,625
prove it chap question
is, but how do we know

282
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,794
they're actually connected?

283
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:33,032
Well, turns out they
arrested approximately

284
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,802
320 people engaging
in these incidents

285
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:40,406
but among those who were
arrested at the very start

286
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,208
of the operation it
was possible to show

287
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,612
that they were, had
contact with authorities

288
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,846
in East Germany.

289
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,582
So in the case of at
least four people,

290
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:55,054
we can trace some
basically covert activity.

291
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,826
One, two of them actually
admitted having worked

292
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,897
as an agent for the
Ministry of State Security

293
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,000
East Berlin so that link
again, was established

294
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,834
a little later.

295
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:14,740
By the way, just in quick
brackets from an investigation

296
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,477
investigators point of
view, I mean, I obviously

297
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,280
have the Internet and
electronic search capabilities

298
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,216
at my disposal today,
but people at the time

299
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,451
didn't have that.

300
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,221
So I can today, tap, I
can connect all the dots

301
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,056
all the different parts,
pieces, bits and pieces

302
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,058
of evidence that appeared
in different countries

303
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,228
very easily and it still
takes a bit of work.

304
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,031
But, it's kind of amazing
that I can illuminate

305
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,668
an incident that
happened so long ago

306
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,472
in more granularity today
because of the Internet.

307
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,443
So, you know, just a
small and fascinating

308
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,579
development there.

309
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,549
Another piece of
evidence appeared

310
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,554
this by the way is a building,

311
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,990
this was how GCHQ
looked like before

312
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,525
they moved to the donut.

313
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,861
This is their headquarters
building before the donut.

314
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,263
The GCHQ most
likely GCHQ the name

315
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:13,298
did not appear in the press.

316
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,768
Reveals another piece
of evidence at the time

317
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,469
which is highly significant.

318
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,639
GCHQ revealed to
three, two or three

319
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:24,443
different newspapers at the
time that they intercepted

320
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:29,381
a piece of communication
from Moscow

321
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:34,386
to East Berlin that
spelled out the operational

322
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,389
Russian R for instigating
these hate crimes.

323
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,591
Actually two pieces
of communication.

324
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,958
One that spelled
out the Russian R

325
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,295
and one that
assessed its success.

326
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,198
So we know from that
leak that the Russians

327
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,600
consider that the Russian
authorities considered

328
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,937
the operation a very
significant success

329
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,807
already in early January.

330
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,342
And that was, you know,
still on going at the time.

331
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,181
Interesting little
technical detail,

332
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:06,385
this is also a rare, early
example of a decrypted

333
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,121
piece of intelligence
getting leaked

334
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,257
to the press which happened,
at least we don't know

335
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,460
of that happening very often.

336
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,628
Small detail of
intelligence history.

337
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,730
But that's not all.

338
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,869
In contrast to today, almost
all intelligence operations

339
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,572
that we look at today
and some of you I'm sure

340
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:31,577
will have done work on
operations that later

341
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,414
turned out to be some sort
of intelligence operation.

342
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,982
State sponsored or private.

343
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,121
We very rarely have the
benefit of defectors.

344
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,456
Of people who leave
the organization

345
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,392
or defect from their
agency and start talking

346
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,697
about planning an operation
and executing an operation.

347
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,799
The benefit of hindsight
in this case is

348
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,602
that we have at least,
we have approximately

349
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,471
five defector accounts, five.

350
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,974
Some of them are less
useful than others

351
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,208
but that illuminate
parts of the operation.

352
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,812
So from those defector
accounts I was actually

353
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,681
able to meet with
two of the defectors

354
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,383
who revealed
information about these,

355
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,754
about this incident, which
was an amazing experience

356
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,557
to talk to these people.

357
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,592
I mean, I remember
one conversation where

358
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,329
anyway this is a public
event, I shouldn't

359
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,764
relay private conversation.

360
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,904
The Khrushchev, who you
see on this picture,

361
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,943
at the time at the
U.N., before he famously

362
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,180
used his shoe to
bang on the table.

363
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,185
But Khrushchev in December
'58, appointed this gentleman

364
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,158
Schelett, Alexander
Shelepin, if I'm pronouncing

365
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,562
this correctly, as Head of KGB.

366
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:01,567
And Shelepin appointed
at KGB, appointed

367
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,306
this gentleman General
Ivan Agayants as the head

368
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,175
of the newly created
Disinformation Department.

369
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,678
So this is the operation
that I described,

370
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,214
was the first major operation
of the newly created

371
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,849
Disinformation Department,
which at that point

372
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,785
and time was only operational
for a couple of weeks,

373
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:21,753
a couple of months.

374
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,723
And their focus was East Berlin.

375
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,726
They had 20 people
stationed in East Berlin

376
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,229
and approximately 50
people stationed in Moscow

377
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,897
and they were only
doing disinformation

378
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,032
and active measures campaign.

379
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,936
Agayants did something
extraordinary,

380
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,539
which we know of from
two defector accounts

381
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,976
and I think we can treat
it as a credible anecdote

382
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,010
around the operation.

383
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,815
So Agayants, he was
a very cultured man,

384
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,451
who spoke multiple languages.

385
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,121
He must of been a very
impressive operator.

386
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,495
He knew from a press report,
from multiple press reports

387
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:10,502
earlier in '58, so one year
before the operation started

388
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,303
there was an actual
anti-Semitic incident

389
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,506
in Germany where a
school teacher had said

390
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,844
something vile,
racist, in a beer hall.

391
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,613
And was then sentenced
to one year in prison.

392
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,516
So this is one year before
the operation started

393
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,019
and the entire affair
with this school teacher

394
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,390
you know, being an anti-Semite
was a huge press story

395
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,858
even in the English
speaking press.

396
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,561
The Guardian covered it, he
saw that and thought to himself

397
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,562
that is interesting.

398
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:41,700
We can probably take
advantage of this, of this

399
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,369
open wound and Germany,
you know, with its

400
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,307
with the genocide and
its immediate past.

401
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,776
On a side note, he was
Armenian so he probably knew

402
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,979
the significance
of national trauma.

403
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,947
'Cause of their own genocide.

404
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,184
So Agayants said okay,
before we actually

405
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,154
run this thing at a global
scale, which of course

406
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,823
is a significant risk
for them as well.

407
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,792
We need to test it.

408
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,360
We need to do a test
run just like, you know,

409
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:14,366
some operations today are
tested in a test lab before.

410
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,803
So he dispatched a
small team of KGB people

411
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,472
to a village outside
Moscow where they

412
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,908
kicked over tombstones,
sprayed, you know,

413
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,914
painted swastikas on
walls, and then you know

414
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,849
disappeared, kept
quiet and watched

415
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,785
how the village would react
to this type of incident.

416
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,055
And they found that most
people were horrified

417
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,057
and didn't like what's
going on but a few

418
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,360
young people would join in.

419
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,664
So they basically
tested in Russia itself

420
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,501
that this kind of instigation
operation would work.

421
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,903
And that is then
exactly how they

422
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,172
started executing the operation.

423
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:59,010
I find, I mean, you have
to almost respect them

424
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,612
for his foresight here.

425
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,814
So this is truly a
daring move on his part

426
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,783
to pull this off.

427
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,151
This is, please don't
treat this picture

428
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,987
as me meeting with
one of the defectors

429
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,223
who actually made
that operation public

430
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:16,228
but I want to draw a few quick
conclusions from this case

431
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,697
to bring it to the press.

432
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,632
Why this is an
interesting case to study.

433
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,935
And I left out a
number of details

434
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,904
that will be in the book.

435
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,039
So just let me highlight
a few bullet points

436
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,143
that I think are
significant for today.

437
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,813
One is remember
those two swastikas?

438
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,549
One was fake and one was real?

439
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,718
And I think we have
the illusion today

440
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,053
because of our media
environments that the line

441
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:46,124
between fake and real can
be drawn quite easily.

442
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,127
Think of the entire
Facebook ad business

443
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:54,132
or you know, falsified
documents within the leaks.

444
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,069
I think people have
that, especially people

445
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,005
with some forensic
training, we think

446
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,474
we can very clearly
draw the line

447
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,310
between where is actually
factual and correct

448
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,812
and what is not but I
think this example shows

449
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,817
that in practice, by
design and this is

450
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,152
kind of difficult to get to
terms with intellectually.

451
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,621
By design, these operations
are blurring the line

452
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,057
between fake and
true and that's not

453
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,759
just a sort of academic thing.

454
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,429
They blur the line because
they create behavior

455
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,299
and I think we see this
almost everyday now.

456
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,770
They create behavior that
would not happen otherwise.

457
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,806
And you cannot say this
is fake or real behavior

458
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,907
I mean obviously
it's real behavior,

459
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,643
but you can't, it's impossible.

460
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,245
The entire discussion
about fake news

461
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,015
and forgeries
versus non-forgeries

462
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,218
has a very different
practical resonance

463
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,520
I think if you come from
a historical perspective.

464
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,822
It's an illusion to
think that we can

465
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,189
draw a clear line here.

466
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,160
The second point I
wanted to point out is

467
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:02,634
about the value of
forensic work in hindsight.

468
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,370
I already mentioned
this, that technology

469
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,972
enabled me to tease
out this story.

470
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,940
I think this would have
been very difficult

471
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,010
for historians you know,
who worked with archives

472
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,247
and paper, boxes and
files only to get

473
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,649
to this level of detail.

474
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,950
So that I think
is a new quality.

475
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,154
Historians I think need
some of the skills as well

476
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:26,091
that you are discussing
at this conference.

477
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,726
A third quick point,
which makes me

478
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,995
very concerned actually.

479
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,431
I can go back and
look at this operation

480
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,101
in hindsight in
extraordinary granular detail

481
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,371
even 60, 50, 60
years after the fact.

482
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:45,844
But we have a problem
with archiving

483
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:50,849
forensic information,
detail, artifacts today.

484
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,885
Just imagine for a
moment, a historian

485
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,454
20 years from now
or 40 years from now

486
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:59,323
wants to go back and
reconstruct the picture

487
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,427
of an operation that
is happening today.

488
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,097
I suspect it will be
much more difficult,

489
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:09,367
probably impossible
to go back to the same

490
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:13,504
granular picture most of
us can pull out today.

491
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,640
So I think we really
have a problem

492
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,711
archiving, archiving
operationally relevant

493
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,513
information today and
I don't really know

494
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,781
what the solution is.

495
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,215
It's not just the
Internet archive,

496
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,586
or archive.is but I would
really encourage you

497
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,189
to think about archiving
for future generations.

498
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,893
We need public record
in order to agree

499
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,861
on what the facts are
and not just today

500
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,296
but also in the future.

501
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,501
Another difference to this
case that I would quickly

502
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,071
want to highlight is the
nature of amplification

503
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,540
has completely changed.

504
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,108
There was no social
media at the time.

505
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,444
Almost the entire
amplification of the operation

506
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,245
was done by journalists.

507
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,617
So in some ways Agayants,
who you can see again

508
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,553
on this picture, General
Agayants and the KGB

509
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:05,390
was extremely effective in
weaponizing journalists.

510
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,661
In weaponizing the press
against the west itself.

511
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,331
Now, but they needed
their tactic operation.

512
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,532
They needed to trick them.

513
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,202
Today amplification
on social media

514
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,238
and on forums and
what not have achieved

515
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,841
an operational
quality on its own.

516
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,176
I think that is a new aspect.

517
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:30,181
Another quick bullet
point, defector accounts

518
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,252
I think, I could not
have told this story

519
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,687
without defector accounts.

520
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,391
Again, the evidence, even
without defector accounts,

521
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,093
without people talking
about the operation

522
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,229
from an inside
perspective, the evidence

523
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:49,234
was pretty good but not perfect.

524
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,703
We need defector
accounts to really close

525
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,105
the loop to get a full picture.

526
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,108
So that also will
be very difficult

527
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,078
to achieve I think
as we move forward

528
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,780
because we don't have a Cold War

529
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,785
context anymore that
would motivate defectors

530
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:07,752
to come forward.

531
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,925
Finally, this speed of
attribution here is fascinating.

532
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,698
If you have a major successful
operation like this,

533
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,866
and I think we had one
in 2016 as you know,

534
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,302
the attribution needs
to happen almost

535
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,105
in real time to reach
the full public,

536
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,708
to reach a full, to
reach it's full impact.

537
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,843
If you have high
quality attribution

538
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,346
five months later
that is just not going

539
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,016
to make a big
difference, which is why

540
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,918
this operation
was so successful.

541
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,853
The attribution was pretty
good even at the time

542
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,458
but it came too late
and I think, most people

543
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,561
in Germany even a few
years later just would

544
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,696
of considered this
wave of anti-Semitism

545
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,831
a wave of anti-Semitism.

546
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,135
In fact, Germany changed
its basic criminal law,

547
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:02,073
Strafgesetzbuch, as a
result of the operation,

548
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,043
which is extraordinary
if you think about it

549
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,579
as a, in terms of
cause and effect.

550
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,617
Finally, the evidence
in this operation again

551
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,920
will always get
called into question.

552
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,689
Even very good evidence.

553
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,158
When Strauss, you know,
the guy on the phone

554
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,593
when he articulated
some findings,

555
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,963
some intelligence
findings his political

556
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,031
opposition party called
them into question.

557
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,533
The New York Times
called it into question.

558
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,138
The press in Germany
did so evidence

559
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,672
even if it's very
good, will always

560
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,141
get called into question.

561
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,676
It think that's just
also sad fact of life.

562
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,544
So just, you know,
be ready for this.

563
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,847
When the stakes
politically are high enough

564
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,383
evidence will not
speak for itself.

565
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,586
You have to speak
for it and again

566
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,288
and again and again.

567
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,323
And finally, and this
is the last point

568
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,526
I want to make, and
there's a provocation

569
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:59,430
I think, to some people
here in this room.

570
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:05,136
We run the risk sometimes today

571
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,741
of talking ourselves
into a forensic fit.

572
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,810
What do I mean by forensic fit?

573
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,711
I mean, you know,
think of the operation

574
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,280
that Agayants planned there.

575
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,918
Today, you know, we
have this basically...

576
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,822
Today we can have a
detailed conversation

577
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,025
of the paint and its chemical
components if you like

578
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,862
that was used to
paint the swastika.

579
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,363
We can have a
detailed conversation

580
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,533
about the bus or the taxi
that the operative took

581
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,937
in order to get to the
Synagogue to paint the swastika.

582
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,737
I'm using a metaphor
obviously, I'm talking

583
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,174
about very detailed
forensic conversations

584
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,177
about technical
specifics of operations

585
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,612
that ultimately, I
mean they are important

586
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,949
sometimes to do the
attribution, but ultimately

587
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,951
they're very down in the weeds

588
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,886
and we need to take a step back

589
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,687
to put things into the
larger perspective,

590
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,023
as I was doing today sometimes.

591
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,891
And the example
that comes to mind

592
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,329
is shadow brokers and
in a way an opetium.

593
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:10,335
Shadow brokers weaponized
the cyber security

594
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,738
community in the same
way Agayants weaponized

595
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:18,176
journalists in the
1960s because by dumping

596
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,946
this tool set, first on Get up.

597
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:25,250
Whoever did this,
they knew exactly

598
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,886
that the cyber security
community would take

599
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,623
those exploits and
tools and you know

600
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,827
sift through them and dig
out the interesting parts

601
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,428
and then make them public.

602
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:41,299
And that part, the sifting
through the evidence

603
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,533
and discussing it
publicly, that created the

604
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,336
actual damage.

605
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,372
That was the actual
operational effect.

606
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:51,276
So, you know, obviously,
it was also important

607
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,645
and necessary to do
that and I'm not saying

608
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,649
you know, we, you, they
shouldn't have done that

609
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:02,553
but the discussion of
an operation itself

610
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,892
has become part of
operations, of an operation.

611
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,397
We have about 12 minutes
left, so I'll stop here

612
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,865
and take a few questions and try

613
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,166
to answer them if I can.

614
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,167
Thank you very much.

615
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,170
(audience clapping)

616
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,675
(upbeat music)
