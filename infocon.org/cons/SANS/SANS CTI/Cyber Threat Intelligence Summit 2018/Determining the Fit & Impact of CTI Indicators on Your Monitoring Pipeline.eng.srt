1
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,146
(applause)

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,315
- This is a new threat
intelligence talk,

3
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,849
really focused on
threat intelligence.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,154
We're calling this TIQ Test
Two, which is a callback to

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,456
the first talk I ever did
here at CTI Summit which was

6
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:28,828
called TIQ Test, and it was
really on IQ Test, right?

7
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,499
Let's see how intelligent
your threat intelligence

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:36,870
really is, and
this is pretty much

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,105
a revisitation of
those concepts,

10
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:44,210
but in a way more practical
and focused direction.

11
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,649
So I think we only
improve by trying,

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,386
and God knows I've tried
a lot to make sense of the

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,723
data that we ingest, and
these are the things that

14
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,291
are working for me now.

15
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,294
Maybe in a couple of years
they will accept me again,

16
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:05,598
and I will have a new
version hopefully.

17
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,101
So anyway, who's
this guy, right?

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,670
So I am first and foremost
a Brazilian immigrant

19
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,707
here in the U.S., and a
capybara enthusiast, right,

20
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,744
if you can tell by
my shirt, right?

21
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,848
And I've been working, I was
a founder at this company

22
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,551
called Niddel, and we built,
and I know I think everybody's

23
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,922
gonna hit their bingo right
now, but it's an autonomous

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,423
threat hunting system.

25
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,026
And the idea is that we were
using threat intelligence

26
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:37,197
and behavioral analytics like
things to try to automate

27
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,133
as much as we could, and
I can see Rob Lee cringing

28
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,369
somewhere, the threat
intelligence practice, right.

29
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,904
And we are now a
part of Verizon.

30
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,738
This is not what
this talk is about.

31
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,509
We're continuing doing the
same thing, the same product,

32
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,145
so if you're curious about
that, just let me know later.

33
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,714
So anyway, what's to expect?

34
00:01:56,182 --> 00:02:00,587
Also before we start, I am
famously known for going

35
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:04,791
overtime on my talks, and this
clock is not ticking, right?

36
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,060
So it's not my fault this time.

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,294
(audience laughs)

38
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,796
I was gonna be, I'm
gonna watch the clock,

39
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,697
thank you, thank you so much.

40
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,100
Anyway, what should we
expect for this talk?

41
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,903
At the very least we'll
have one fair warning.

42
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,839
A witty metaphor,
I hope it lands.

43
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,808
We have three novel-ish ideas.

44
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,609
It's a kind of a rehash.

45
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,480
Some of them are a rehash
on the original TIQ test,

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,983
but some of them
are hopefully novel.

47
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,452
Hopeful dreams, right?

48
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,254
Why can't we think about
what's the research gonna be

49
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,289
like in a few years, right?

50
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,756
A lot of self serving callbacks.

51
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,492
I have warned you I'm gonna
be talking about some of

52
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,361
my previous research as well.

53
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,631
And at least one capybara,
so that's a promise.

54
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,902
That first one, oh
that's not really.

55
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,470
That was one, right.

56
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,440
There might be another
one going forward.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,241
So anyway,

58
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,047
I'm not breaking any campaigns.

59
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:05,185
I'm not talking about this
huge criminal organization.

60
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm not talking
about trade craft.

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,523
I'm here as an
accountant, right?

62
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,561
I'm just trying to tally
up kind of the data sets

63
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,698
that we have, tally up the
threat intelligence that we

64
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,035
try to consume every day and
try to make some use of it.

65
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,272
That's kind of my life's
work, and specifically because

66
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,610
the research that I have
worked in dabbles a lot

67
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,478
in machine learning.

68
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,349
It necessarily dabbles a
lot in data quality, right?

69
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,817
This is the most
important, important thing.

70
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,122
Every hour you spend in data
quality and making sure that

71
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,258
the ground truth that you
have and you're training your

72
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,728
models in, it's a hundred
times more valuable,

73
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,197
a thousand times more
valuable than a hour you spend

74
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,967
tweaking the algorithm
or something like that.

75
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,536
So I do spend a lot of
time thinking about this,

76
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,839
and this is a kind of a,
I mean this is what data

77
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,674
scientists do, I guess.

78
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,876
I always keep telling accountant
friends that they should

79
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,446
just call themselves
money scientists.

80
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,748
They would be much more
popular because we're kind of

81
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,549
doing the same thing.

82
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,355
So anyway I believe that only
by facing this kind of thing

83
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,591
and trying to have metrics
around how well we're doing

84
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:23,429
we're actually gonna be
able to industrialize this,

85
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,299
because we're all working
very hard here, right?

86
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,635
And I have no doubt that
the brightest minds in

87
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:32,238
threat intelligence generation
are here in this room,

88
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,807
but if we cannot get this
reliably to the teams who

89
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,744
are defending, and in a way
that they don't have to do

90
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,680
a lot of work in order to
combat false positives and

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,317
things like that, we're not
really doing our job, right?

92
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:48,821
The bottom line is
defense, and Lincoln was,

93
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,423
somebody read my report.

94
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,926
We should be super proud,
somebody used my IOC

95
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,228
in order to catch
someone, right?

96
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,163
So this is what we want too.

97
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:02,001
But anyway this is about
metrics, but specifically

98
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,469
metrics on what?

99
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,005
So I'm gonna be talking
specifically about one thing

100
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,741
that I know a lot of people
in SANS are very, very

101
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,344
passionate about, and it's
one of the things that brings

102
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,946
the SANS community together.

103
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,984
And I've heard it's something
that everyone believes

104
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,822
so strongly, you could always
be, I mean it's a kind of

105
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,392
always has a pejorative context,
but it's kind of a cult.

106
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,029
I'm obviously talking
about Orangetheory, right?

107
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:35,034
So for you folks who are not
aware of what Orangetheory is,

108
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,741
it's basically maybe a
metrics driven crossfit.

109
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,377
I don't know, it's all
about the gains I'm told,

110
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,381
and the idea is that you're
exercising, and there's this

111
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:52,585
huge board, and it's really
accounting how much percentage

112
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,087
of your heart rate is at
because if you're above a

113
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,224
specific percentage,
it's magic, right,

114
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,159
and you never have
to exercise again.

115
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,794
It's something along
those lines, okay.

116
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,462
I might be misquoting
a little bit.

117
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:07,166
I'm not an expert on this
specific part of the talk.

118
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,938
So anyway, it's January,
right, so new year resolution.

119
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,375
My wife manages to drag me
to an Orangetheory class,

120
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,079
and I'm like okay, sure,
it's gonna be a disaster.

121
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,281
What's gonna happen, right?

122
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,850
It's terrible.

123
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,855
So to my surprise, not only
I seem to do a good job,

124
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,659
I'm actually the best
one in the class, right?

125
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,329
I'm the one that burns
the most calories,

126
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,199
I'm the one who has
the most Splat points.

127
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,102
I know, I didn't come up
with the name, I'm sorry.

128
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,772
But the idea of the splat point

129
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:51,677
was that I was exercising above
the specific level, right?

130
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,547
And so, it was a good exercise

131
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,182
and if I got enough of those

132
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,919
there would be long term
benefits and things like that.

133
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,387
And I'm like, "Huh,
that's funny."

134
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,588
I'm not usually,

135
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,223
I shouldn't have been the best.

136
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,928
I mean I'm so unfit,
why would I be the best.

137
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:13,633
And then I realized, "Oh,
this is gonna get harder.

138
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,105
So, the fitter I am,

139
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,909
the more effort I'm
gonna have to put

140
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,612
in order to get the same result.

141
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,349
And it's actually an
interesting twist because

142
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,986
it really incentivizes
people to start.

143
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,290
And I started
thinking about this.

144
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:43,229
What if Orangetheory is
what I'm consuming in a way?

145
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,700
It's a set of exercises,
it's a set of things

146
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,104
that I have to do in order
to achieve a specific goal.

147
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:58,244
And that combined
with my telemetry,

148
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,247
what results I'm getting of it,

149
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,383
what kind of, I don't know,

150
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,051
I was gonna put the
thing but I forgot.

151
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,455
I was gonna put the heart
rate monitor but anyway.

152
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,289
What if combined with that?

153
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,594
I have some first
order utility here

154
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,629
so I can measure what happened

155
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,099
when I applied this specific
set of instructions,

156
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,169
specific set of things
into my telemetry.

157
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,572
So this is like the
easiest thing to measure,

158
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,175
would be for instance
the calories that I burn,

159
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,278
but then there are some
second order benefits here,

160
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,615
which is the thing I should
be really searching for.

161
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,786
And hm, okay, I wonder if I can
make a parallel to something

162
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,624
where as you get more mature,

163
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,860
and as you're trying
for more sources,

164
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,064
it actually makes it a lot
harder for you to find the way

165
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,665
what is the optimal mix

166
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,069
or what's the optimal things
that we should be doing.

167
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:02,842
So anyway, it's all
about good measurement,

168
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:07,813
especially as you're input
is transforming your maturity

169
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,615
has to make sure that
you're taking diminishing,

170
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,284
diminishing returns
into account.

171
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,787
What I'm telling you is that

172
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,391
after your first million IOCs,

173
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,759
the second million IOCs are

174
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,361
probably not gonna
make you any better.

175
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,629
Probably not.

176
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,631
That's not the metric
you should be chasing.

177
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,101
That's not what it's all about.

178
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:33,205
But how do you understand better
what first and second order

179
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:37,076
utility you might get from
your ingestion strategy

180
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,612
might help you to be a
little bit more prepared

181
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,146
going forward.

182
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:46,085
So anyway, way, way, 50 years
ago, I don't remember anymore

183
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,622
I had the idea of the GIQ.

184
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,656
It was really about measuring

185
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,427
some things you could get from
threat intelligence feeds.

186
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,365
So there were five tests, I'm
not gonna go into great detail

187
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,034
but they're organized
like that on purpose.

188
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,804
So the first two were
pretty much about,

189
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,740
"Oh, is this feed even alive?

190
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,343
Are they taking
old indicators out?

191
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,777
Are they adding new IOCs in?"

192
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,617
And to be quite frank of you,
this is like inside baseball.

193
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,218
This is really not
interesting for anyone

194
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,022
unless you are a threat
intelligence generator,

195
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,557
and you wanna say, "Oh yeah,

196
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,361
I'm more agile than the other
folks or something like that."

197
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,530
So there's interest but
there's not really a lot

198
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,964
going on there.

199
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,234
Then there was the
overlap and the uniqueness

200
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,570
which was really, got
people very excited

201
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,672
because they could
start to see, "Oh yeah,

202
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,642
so this feed actually has
the same kind of stuff

203
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,709
as that feed,"

204
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,879
which is helpful.

205
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,816
You're trying to, maybe you
have a pipeline that is not

206
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,552
so complete or
maybe not so stable.

207
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,854
And you wanna make
sure you ingest,

208
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,823
you can only have
like 500,000 per day,

209
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,260
and you wanna make sure you're
getting the right 500,000.

210
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,164
But this gives you insight
on what you're consuming.

211
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,900
But so I think they
were too complicated

212
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,101
for what they were meant to be.

213
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,370
They didn't really have
to be that specific

214
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,073
for it to be useful for
a team that's defending.

215
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:19,045
And finally, we have population
which was the odd one out

216
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,282
in the sense that it tried to
find a relationship between

217
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:28,287
the data you're generating,
like your telemetry and the

218
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,656
the actually data on
the threat intelligence,

219
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,092
which is kinda the
first order utility,

220
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,462
and it's crappy, but at
least it's not cropped there.

221
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,901
So it's, we're gonna revisit
that but it's gonna be

222
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,703
again, simpler.

223
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,672
So if you're really
super curious,

224
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,708
you should look into those.

225
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,242
They're not gonna really matter.

226
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,445
Whatever we need from them,
we're gonna go through on this

227
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,980
specific thing.

228
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,384
So what I wanna introduce
first is the coverage test.

229
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,754
In reading the coverage test,

230
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,891
and it's kind of an evolution
of the overlap concept,

231
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:10,096
is are you getting
the data you need from

232
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,997
the feeds you consume?

233
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,568
And the idea is really are you
just ingesting the same thing

234
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,002
over and over and over again?

235
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,641
And by understanding how much
unique data each feed has,

236
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,478
so that's really the only
thing you need to know,

237
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,713
while you're ingesting them.

238
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,050
You know what opportunities
to improve your detection,

239
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,454
actually are from the data
that you have collected.

240
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:41,427
So this was the overlap test.

241
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,529
And again, this is
too much inside base.

242
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,098
I don't really need to know that

243
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:51,103
what I had on OTX was 55%
of what I had on VX vault.

244
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,641
And most of these names are

245
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,343
open threat intelligence
feeds that you

246
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:01,280
probably heard about,
specifically OTX was at the time

247
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,182
this thing was calculated.

248
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,085
We were using it a lot for our
homegrown threat intelligence

249
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,589
So, I mean it's
interesting, it's curious.

250
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,658
If you're really going
deep into comparing

251
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,327
a bunch of different
feeds against each other,

252
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,262
this is useful.

253
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,263
But it's still inside baseball.

254
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,600
What we need is something
way, way simpler.

255
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,637
I was advised against putting
those kinds of slides,

256
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,805
but I'm sorry you
accepted my talk,

257
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,574
you're gonna have to
suffer through it.

258
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,478
This is very simple
guys, deep breaths.

259
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,647
The only thing I'm doing
on this coverage test

260
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,317
is seeing what is
the difference,

261
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,920
what do you have on the feed,

262
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,555
what you have on
the specific feed

263
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,891
that you don't have on all
the others that you have.

264
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,892
What is unique on a feed,

265
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,330
that's the coverage, how much
indicators I have on this feed

266
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,232
that I don't have
on any other feed,

267
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:57,303
and the percentage of
coverage is how does that look

268
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,738
against how many things
I have on the feed.

269
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:04,643
So let's say I have a feed with
10 IPs and those are unique.

270
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,780
Sorry, I have a feed of 100 IPs,

271
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,749
but only 10 of those are
not in any other feeds.

272
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:15,221
So this will have 10 of
coverage and will have a 10%

273
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,589
of coverage percentage.

274
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,992
So this is the kind of
thing that you would expect

275
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,896
and I appreciate
it's very tini-tiny.

276
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,998
But, let me see if I
can fix here to help.

277
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,536
But specifically, it's giving
you an idea of how much

278
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,204
independent data you're
getting from each feed.

279
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,709
So specifically there, I told
you that OTX was one that

280
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,444
was a lot of our
homegrown stuff.

281
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,045
We weren't really
seeing it anywhere else.

282
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,916
OpenPhish is usually very fresh.

283
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,852
It competes our ongoing,

284
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,754
it's not usually
on more established

285
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,122
threat intelligence feeds

286
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,192
but then you can start
to see, "Oh, okay."

287
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,227
So this is kind of the utility

288
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,428
I'm getting through
each one of them.

289
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,364
This is what I
have to play with.

290
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:04,169
And even if, if you
have a pipeline issue,

291
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,306
or maybe if you're paying
for something that's not

292
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:14,413
you're not seeing this
specific breadth of uniqueness,

293
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,749
maybe you shouldn't
be ingesting,

294
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,017
you shouldn't be
playing with them.

295
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,120
And conversely, you
have the percentage,

296
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,822
which I mean gives you
a better perspective

297
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,124
on scale and variance.

298
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,659
It doesn't matter if a feed,

299
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:31,664
if a feed has a million things
and only one, only a hundred

300
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,900
are unique, you're always,

301
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,703
you're specifically looking at

302
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,342
it's way worse than someone
that has 100 that is unique.

303
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,010
And this is also very handy,

304
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,247
because when a vendor
comes to you and is like,

305
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,782
"Please, I'd like a half
a million dollars from you

306
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,084
for you to have my feed."

307
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,484
You can just show them,

308
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,855
"Actually, only 25% of
everything new so I would like

309
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,725
75% discount please."

310
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,428
Doesn't usually work, but
well, it's worth a try.

311
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:04,896
So,

312
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,935
we have to be cautious
with our interpretation.

313
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,139
This is just a numeric number
for something that is way

314
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,808
It's usually way fuzzier.

315
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,813
So if something is unique,
it's potentially a lot wrong.

316
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,484
So this also helps
you understand

317
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,421
if a feed makes sense on the
context of what you're doing.

318
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,923
So it's important to see

319
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,226
if these folks specialize
in something or other thing.

320
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,329
It might reflect on
those uniqueness numbers.

321
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,667
And also, you don't
really have to cut

322
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,037
the feeds that you
have duplicates.

323
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,339
So it's not uncommon
that people will,

324
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,809
"Well, if I have two matches
on two different feeds

325
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,944
while I'm doing the
analysis, you know what?

326
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,048
I'll just bypass the sir team.

327
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,684
I'll directly open a
ticket for handling,

328
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,153
because I have enough
confidence because it wasn't on

329
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,089
two or three completely
separate things.

330
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,759
And this should be good.

331
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,594
I mean I don't believe
all those people

332
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,029
would do the same mistake."

333
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,432
It happens, but,
especially when it's like

334
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,434
active response and everybody's
trying to figure out

335
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,268
what's going on.

336
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,303
It's not fun.

337
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,041
But anyway, this has nothing
to do with generation coverage.

338
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,376
I'm not tracking an
actor and seeing, "Oh,

339
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,812
do I know all the things
this actor is doing?"

340
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,683
So there was a talk I
think on a previous summit

341
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:35,120
from Aaron Schumacher or
specifically about that.

342
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,556
How do you make sure
your expected levels of

343
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,760
"I should be seeing
this amount of low key

344
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,395
or this amount of
3DX because I know

345
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,165
they're all the same group,
but they keep switching,

346
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,633
so I know that I,

347
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,934
they must be getting their
money from somewhere.

348
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,302
I wanna make sure
I'm tracking them."

349
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,303
So this has nothing
to do with that.

350
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,474
That's really a
generation problem

351
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,109
which we're not
talking about here.

352
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,145
But anyway, this is
what I mean by coverage.

353
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:05,084
So talking about what
we have to work with,

354
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,319
then we go into the fit,

355
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,257
is really how much does this
thing matches what I have.

356
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,362
And again, I have
this population test.

357
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,532
And I even have the slide
of the population test,

358
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,868
and I was again advised
against not showing you

359
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,570
the slide of the
population test.

360
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,107
But that advice I took because
it's really preposterous.

361
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,542
It's really, it's way too
clever for its own good.

362
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,411
It doesn't really
serve any real purpose

363
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,914
as far as telling
you about the feed,

364
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,516
although I believe that,

365
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,453
and this is a part of the
calculations that we do

366
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,356
in the model, in the
feature sets of the models

367
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,058
that we have worked with.

368
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,229
Talk about how different
is this bad traffic

369
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,197
from your normal traffic.

370
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,564
This is part of the equation.

371
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,701
It's very, it's
interesting for the action

372
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,703
if you're expecting
a place to be

373
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,672
more evil than other places,

374
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,441
when you're trying to
make an informed decision

375
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,611
if you should investigate
something or not.

376
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,114
But the point, again,
going back to the million,

377
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:14,086
to the millions and
millions of IOCs,

378
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,722
if you don't see those
IOCs on your telemetry,

379
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,456
they're just wasting space.

380
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:22,494
You're not really using their
detection power for anything.

381
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:28,266
So, again, very simple.

382
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,369
The idea is I'm trying to find

383
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,437
for each one of the
feeds that I have

384
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,506
what is the intersection
between the feed

385
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,576
and the stuff that
I have visited?

386
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,614
And before anybody
throws a fit on the one

387
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,553
the specific part is really
what we were doing before

388
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,054
on the coverage test.

389
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:53,091
So the unique fitness would be
how much of the unique stuff

390
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,527
that I have on each feed
then becomes relevant

391
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,430
for my telemetry.

392
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,435
So every time a threat
intelligence feed
hits your telemetry

393
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:09,474
it's hopefully a chance for
you to detect something bad.

394
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,010
That's assuming that
the feed is correct.

395
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,379
That's a huge, huge
assumption, I know.

396
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,817
But the parallel I'm
trying to do here

397
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,154
this is pretty much how much
calories you're gonna spend

398
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,122
out of the specific feed.

399
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,292
The rest is just like, you know,
you're just drinking water,

400
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,093
you're eating I
don't know, lettuce.

401
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,796
It's not really
counting for anything.

402
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,364
I know that that's not real.

403
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,168
That counts for a
lot but bear with me.

404
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,906
So, this is an
example of UniqueFit.

405
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,743
And again I have the
OTX that was very unique

406
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,614
on that specific group showing
up as a very, very high bar

407
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,416
but still, it's matching a lot

408
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:56,154
on a specific group of
telemetry that I have selected.

409
00:20:56,154 --> 00:21:00,158
More usually than not,
if you have a huge fit

410
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,330
in an environment that you
don't expect to be very noisy,

411
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,667
it means you have a few
false positives there.

412
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:14,306
So the second one is
actually Bambenek's feed.

413
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,576
So, some of you might be
familiar with John Bambenek.

414
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,580
He, I'm not sure if
I'm pronouncing his
last name correctly.

415
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,981
He works at Fidelis and

416
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,652
he has a very good
open-source feed for DGA.

417
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,955
And he does an excellent job,
excellent job on cleaning

418
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,389
the DGA feed.

419
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,360
But once every, I
don't know, few times

420
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,231
parking IP address
sneaks through.

421
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,434
So someone read through the
domain, but it fell on a parking

422
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,671
and you'll have people
accessing parking IP addresses

423
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,638
left, right, and center.

424
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,206
So you also see a lot of,

425
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,007
you would see a lot of matches,

426
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,510
again, if you know the lineage.

427
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,746
So when I say investigate
the outliers is

428
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,649
are those matches expected?

429
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,485
Is this high number
of matches expected

430
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,588
from what I'm
seeing on this feed?

431
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,624
From what I understand
where the feed is?

432
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,962
And can I keep them in control

433
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,299
as far as my detection
pipeline is concerned

434
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,403
because I can now
predict or I can now

435
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,706
at least try to
understand better

436
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,240
what are the kinds
of false positives

437
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,745
that this feed might generate.

438
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,147
And I understand there's a lot,

439
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:33,418
this is a lot of things that's
not on that number over there

440
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,522
but the number told me as
a part of the investigation

441
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:42,027
of what is this feed and what
potential impact this feed

442
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,628
can have on my telemetry,

443
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,062
it gave me a prompt of,

444
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,566
"Okay, now I need to do
some work on this feed

445
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:51,236
to understand what's the best
possible way for me to do it."

446
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,305
But it just gives you clarity.

447
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,507
it gives you
something to look at.

448
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,876
And also a trend to follow.

449
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,846
If one of those
feeds vary too much,

450
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,015
they must have lost their
sources and methods,

451
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,451
I've seen this happen
a long, a lot of times.

452
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:10,622
It was so fun when like
Neckers just went dark.

453
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,558
A lot of people that had
such great intel about

454
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,428
cyber crime activities,
they're just like,

455
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:20,265
"Oh, yeah, we're not quite
sure what's going on.

456
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,466
We should be getting emails."

457
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:25,637
And Emotet is on
vacation apparently.

458
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,505
Nobody have seen them
since, I don't know,

459
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,207
January 10th or something.

460
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,711
So you can start to be prepared

461
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,380
and understand those variations.

462
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,582
And if those variations have
impact on your detection

463
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,952
or your collection requirements.

464
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,523
So anyway, most important thing,

465
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,926
a bad fit does not
mean a bad feed.

466
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,128
It's just not good for you.

467
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,366
If I get a little bit of
Robley's beard, you know

468
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,735
and I sprinkle it on the
telemetry, it might not hit

469
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,672
on the telemetry of
a small credit union.

470
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:04,676
And that's fine, I'm sure

471
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,745
it will be great on
an ICS environment.

472
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,283
But you gotta be, it
also helps you of course.

473
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,285
Make sure whatever you're
getting is tailored for your,

474
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,554
for your specific need.

475
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:21,493
And again, this doesn't, nothing
here solves false positives

476
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,129
I'm sorry, if that's
what you were expecting.

477
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,833
But the idea is, again, giving
you clarity and making sure

478
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,936
you have a number to follow

479
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,236
and to understand
what's going on.

480
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,673
What I think it's,
it's very positive.

481
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,409
I mean we just didn't
have a talk where

482
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,311
no one ever in this
room is gonna share

483
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,612
any indicators ever again,

484
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,883
I think it's interesting,
the fact that

485
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:49,721
having a fit of the IOCs with
the telemetries of the members

486
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,157
of a sharing community,
helps answer the

487
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,025
"Am I the only one
seeing this" question,

488
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,963
which is honestly, I
think it's the most

489
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,432
the question people
want the most answered

490
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,900
out of a sharing
community like this.

491
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,971
Are they targeting me or is
anyone else seeing all of this?

492
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:12,010
I'm not even gonna go
into that bucket of wasps

493
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,446
because I already have a whole
talk about sharing community

494
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,216
and there were some
disagreements around that one.

495
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,185
Anyway, where do we wanna get?

496
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,121
We wanna get into impact, we
wanna get those splat points.

497
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,793
So, really the idea
is how much detection

498
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,995
are we getting out of this?

499
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,999
And this should be
our gold standard.

500
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,601
And you see, I'm very,

501
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:41,406
my function good alert is really
the million dollar function

502
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,808
what is a good
alert, right there?

503
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:49,147
But really the idea here,
what I'm trying to convey

504
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:53,752
as a good alert as far as threat
intelligence is concerned,

505
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,455
is an alert that is correct.

506
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,457
Even though it has been
alerted by something,

507
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,593
what's wrong Rob?

508
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,261
I see you're, (audience
member speaking)

509
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,966
okay, umm, I don't
know, I'm just nervous.

510
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,503
He's walking a lot there.
(audience member speaking)

511
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,638
Okay, that's fair.

512
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:17,108
So my idea here is
if you detected this

513
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,610
using your threat intelligence,

514
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,714
"Oh but my farrow also found
it," it was a good alert.

515
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,182
It wasn't a false positive.

516
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,518
I'm talking about utility
that you're getting

517
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,720
from this specific
detection control.

518
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:35,760
And this is really where
the thing shines I believe.

519
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,029
And I put those squares there

520
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,066
just for us to be able
to track those between

521
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:45,003
specifically the analysis
as the impact as a whole.

522
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:49,474
So we're talking here
that 80-ish percent

523
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:54,479
of the, of abuse.ch
ransomware tracker,

524
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,984
they were good, they generated
alerts that were good.

525
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,620
They were verified by the
team and they loved it.

526
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,091
And we had a similar
number for VX vault,

527
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,659
which is, I mean
those folks in Europe

528
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,761
that maintain this list.

529
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:13,565
It's kept very
up-to-date with malware

530
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,700
from several different
denominations.

531
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,537
But when you combine
that with unique impact,

532
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,307
and that's interesting, right?

533
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,843
Almost everyone has
the ransomware data

534
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,780
or had the ransomware data
when this thing was analyzed.

535
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,916
And it was really the
peak of ransomware

536
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,654
and everybody was, everybody
and their dog had one,

537
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,722
that this specific
analysis was made.

538
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:42,460
But you see VX vault became,
still stayed very high

539
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,665
on the detection level,
unique detection level.

540
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,932
And what I mean by that is that

541
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,834
there were things that
were only on VX vault.

542
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,337
If I hadn't had that feed there,

543
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:56,141
the specific detection mechanism

544
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,609
wouldn't have been triggered.

545
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,879
I still think that's not enough.

546
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,118
and I'm still only talking
about direct matches.

547
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,021
I'm still only talking,
I found this IP address.

548
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,058
I found this domain on a feed.

549
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,527
But what if we learned from it.

550
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,862
And everybody here,
a lot of folks here,

551
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,698
Keith was one who's
talking about it,

552
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,800
about climbing the pyramid,

553
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,269
is if I have IP
addresses and domains,

554
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,938
can I learn a higher order
of detection from that

555
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,808
and then expand from it?

556
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,476
And I have a simple example here

557
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,612
where I had three
domains which were USA.CC

558
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:38,283
pointing to an IP address,
but then my detection was

559
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,753
this MAC security USA.CC.

560
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:46,758
So should I give malware
domains and this Niddel-sourced

561
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,465
threat intelligence a credit
for that detection as well?

562
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,867
How do I account that?

563
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,203
It's probably not the
same credit as that one.

564
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:03,141
Should I take into consideration
how the way I looked

565
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,811
at this data points and how
they were related on who is

566
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,447
on those things, so
it's a very complicated

567
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,817
question to answer
with the amount of math

568
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:16,521
that I'm allowed to
show here on this stage.

569
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,358
But the idea is that you should
also be able to understand

570
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:25,096
what of your detection power
is coming from the learning,

571
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,767
from your team working on threat
intelligence that they know

572
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,103
and then expanding
on that knowledge to
find specific things

573
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,439
Again, this is not
achievable for everyone.

574
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,407
You actually have to
have a team, which is

575
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,610
either actively threat
hunting or actively working,

576
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,746
messaging those IOCs
to generate this

577
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,683
added value so to
speak, but anyway,

578
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,985
anyone can dream.

579
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,088
So what about the future, right?

580
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,992
Let's use some, let's use
some predictions here.

581
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,561
Here are the things
that I would like to do.

582
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:01,566
We got as far as how much, how
many times I was above 84%.

583
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,403
What would I really like to do?

584
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:09,274
I would really like
to talk about benefit.

585
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,842
What's the benefit of this feed?

586
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,247
And so the idea is if I
could use this feed correctly

587
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,716
or this combination
of feeds, I assure you

588
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,519
you'll have at least 10
actionable alerts per week.

589
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,823
This is a huge,
huge thing to say,

590
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,392
because not only you
have to understand

591
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,562
that an alert was generated,
but actually what was

592
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:35,332
the process on the
IR team to handle it,

593
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,903
and what was the outcome
from the IR team,

594
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,271
in order to do that.

595
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,240
And this is an end-to-end that,

596
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,411
I was gonna say I haven't
seen many people do that.

597
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,949
I haven't seen anyone that
does that effectively,

598
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,484
that actually is able
to feed that data back.

599
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,918
And if we go even further,

600
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,855
we could start talking
about assurance,

601
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,859
which is, "Well, we
are so much in control

602
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,194
of the intelligence
that we're generating.

603
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:07,799
We know we can find those
folks within 24 or 48 hours.

604
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,603
Even if they switch
their infrastructure,

605
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:16,140
we know how they usually
switch or we know what is

606
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,777
within their operational
parameters of velocity.

607
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:24,048
So we would be able to find
them again fairly quickly.

608
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,919
This is something that I'm not
sure if it's even possible.

609
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:35,026
And unless we're actively
working to tie back breaches

610
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,398
and handle incidents back
to the detection path.

611
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,168
So this is a whole talk
about lineage in a way.

612
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,537
I'm trying to tell you,
I'm trying to account for

613
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,575
for each detection that I did,
who was responsible for it?

614
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,310
Which feed? What happened?

615
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:57,282
And if we can follow this
threat up until the actual

616
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,752
resolution of the incident,

617
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:06,024
we would have a much better
understanding of how much

618
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,626
a feed or any detective
control really.

619
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:12,397
This is not necessarily a
talk about threat intelligence

620
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,064
was able to generate for us.

621
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,667
And I'd love to go
somewhere and say,

622
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,635
"Okay, if you do this
four times a week,

623
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,605
we're going to keep
you below 200 pounds

624
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,740
and you're gonna be fine, but
at least until you're 45."

625
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,877
I'd love to do that, but
nobody wants to sell me that.

626
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,846
I actually have to work
for it, it's terrible.

627
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,317
Anyway, my point is

628
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,087
it's not easy.

629
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,090
You just can't buy
a feed and hope that

630
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,358
everything's gonna
turn out right.

631
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,060
You actually have
to work for it.

632
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,564
So to avoid diminishing returns
and let's continually be

633
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,999
understanding what the mix is

634
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,867
and how you put
those things to work,

635
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:55,740
and if you don't understand
how those things are

636
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,676
fueling your detection pipeline,

637
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:02,179
you're gonna get this
detection plateau.

638
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,748
And I'm not sure if I'm
talking to the people

639
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:04,983
who actually exercise.

640
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,918
I'm trying very hard
to push this analogy.

641
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,956
And you're just getting more
feeds and you're not getting

642
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:16,961
any more secure or more
fit or more mature.

643
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,731
Anyway, Rob.

644
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,400
- Thank you so much.

645
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,835
- Alright, clap
for him, everybody.

646
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,836
Alright, thanks man.
