1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,836
(calm music)

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,178
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,415
- So, you've learned a lot
over the past couple days

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,817
about intelligence at really
a couple different levels.

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,721
At strategic, operational
and tactical levels.

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,189
What I'm gonna talk
about today really

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,357
I think I applies
to all of those.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,724
We're not gonna get too deep in

9
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,093
the weeds as far
as bits and bots.

10
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,029
My goal today is
really to teach you

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,332
a little bit about yourself
and about your thought process.

12
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,368
One of the things I focus
on in terms of my research

13
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,771
is the intersection
of human psychology

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,140
and the investigative process.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,708
In our field I think
we're in a place

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,476
where we're obviously
a very young field,

17
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,879
and most of the information
we rely on is very tacit.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,547
It's not written down.

19
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,483
It's not explicit and we
have a hard time teachin' it.

20
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,218
So I study the
investigative process

21
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,254
and what makes someone
a good investigator.

22
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,488
Why investigations work.

23
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,790
Why they fail.

24
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,358
Those sort of things
and that again lives

25
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,193
at the intersection
of psychology

26
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,196
and the investigator
work that many of you do.

27
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,632
So I'm gonna talk
today about curiosity.

28
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,233
And there's no
scene that I think

29
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,704
better describes curiosity
in a picture than this one.

30
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,539
Of course this is from
Alice in Wonderland.

31
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,944
There was a book written
and this was the cartoon

32
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,212
that Disney made based on that.

33
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,447
The cartoon's wonderful.

34
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,948
Many of us have
probably seen it.

35
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,750
And there's really early on
in the book and in the movie,

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,620
Alice sees a rabbit and
this rabbit is very peculiar

37
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,256
in that it is wearing
clothes and talking.

38
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,091
(laughs)

39
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,026
She follows the rabbit.

40
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,259
She chases it to the edge of

41
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,229
this rabbit hole
that you see here.

42
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,730
And she had a decision to make.

43
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,133
She can leave it be and go back

44
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,836
to her ho hum life as it
was described in the book,

45
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,670
or she can as Morpheus would say

46
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,906
see how deep the
rabbit hole goes.

47
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,608
She of course chose the latter

48
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,176
and that was the premise
for the entire book

49
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,246
and really the theme of the
book is actually curiosity.

50
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,149
Because curiosity was indeed
the thing that compelled Alice

51
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,685
to go down and have the
fantastical adventure

52
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,520
down the rabbit
hole that she had.

53
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,857
So I love this picture as a set
up for this particular talk.

54
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,093
Now, the baseline
knowledge you need

55
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,294
to understand what I'm
going to talk about

56
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,829
is the fact that
generally speaking,

57
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,265
we're all investigators
in information security.

58
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,968
This room specifically in
terms of intelligence analysis

59
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,636
even outside of
information security,

60
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,271
just generalized
intelligence analysis

61
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,972
but especially in InfoSec,

62
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,075
whether it be blue team
work, red team work,

63
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,677
we're all investigating
something.

64
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,245
And to understand how
investigations work

65
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,413
you really need to
understand the difference

66
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,449
between perception and reality.

67
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,751
So I want to do an
exercise with you today

68
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,453
and it's gonna require a
little bit of participation.

69
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,821
I'm not gonna make ya stand up

70
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,357
but I am gonna make
you close your eyes.

71
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,325
So I want everyone to
close their eyes with me.

72
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,960
You just have to trust I'm
not making faces at you.

73
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,597
And I want you to imagine
that your best friend

74
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,900
has invited you over to
their house for dinner.

75
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,670
And you walk in and
you take a big whiff.

76
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,505
(sniffing)

77
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,040
And you smell it.

78
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,909
The glorious combination
of meat, cheese and bread,

79
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,777
and sauce that is pizza.

80
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,577
Right?

81
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,846
You smell it.

82
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,446
You can't see it
but you smell it.

83
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,247
Right?

84
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,081
It's in the other room.

85
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,349
So there's a reality.

86
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,816
You can open up your
eyes at this point.

87
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,120
As a matter of fact, Rick
Holland what's on your pizza?

88
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,189
- [Rick] Brisket.

89
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,023
- Brisket?

90
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,957
That's a good pizza.

91
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,625
You sir what's on your pizza?

92
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,459
- [Audience Member] Pepperoni.

93
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,961
- Pepperoni, okay.

94
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,096
So you could have anything
on your pizza that you want

95
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,464
at this point 'cause it's
only your perception.

96
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,066
You don't see it, right?

97
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,601
It exists in the other room.

98
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,869
Maybe it's in the oven but
you can't actually see it

99
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,003
and there are a lot of
things that influence

100
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,137
what might be on your pizza.

101
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,005
Right?

102
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,507
The folks I just asked,

103
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,175
their probably sayin' what's
their favorite topping right?

104
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,376
So there's a memory component.

105
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,178
You're obviously
have sensory imput.

106
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,980
You're smelling and
you can maybe discern

107
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,415
some of the ingredients
that are on it.

108
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,882
Maybe you can smell green
peppers or something like that.

109
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,085
Some of the more pungent
type ingredients.

110
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,687
Maybe you have memories of what

111
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,422
your friends favorite pizza is,

112
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,190
or that maybe he's cooked
pizza for you before

113
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,959
and you have that memory
and you apply that.

114
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,493
So you have all these
different inputs

115
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,630
that you're assimilating into
your perception of the pizza.

116
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,965
Does that perception necessarily

117
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,367
equal the reality of the pizza?

118
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,635
It doesn't.

119
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,869
At some point the
pizza's gonna come.

120
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,404
It's gonna be put
right in front of you

121
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,972
and you're gonna taste it
and then your perception

122
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,708
and your reality will meet
and become the same thing.

123
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,642
Right?

124
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,910
So that process I'm describing,

125
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,412
the process of forming
an initial perception,

126
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,281
assimilating new
information to it

127
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,751
until you hopefully arrive at
the accurate state of reality,

128
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,287
that's what we do as
investigators, right?

129
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,824
Now, thinking about that
in a more macro sense,

130
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,158
there's another word for that
and it's called cognition

131
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:22,228
which is essentially a
fancy word for learning.

132
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,763
Right?

133
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,864
Investigating is essentially
just learning about things.

134
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,299
And the take away from that is

135
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,734
if you can understand learning
and the different things

136
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,236
that go into it and how it works

137
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,206
and what makes it excel
and what makes it tougher,

138
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,674
if you can understand
those things,

139
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,943
then you can better understand
the investigative process.

140
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,678
So our understanding
of our own cognition

141
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,314
is absolutely critical
in understanding

142
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,083
how we investigate and curiosity

143
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,686
is one of the biggest parts
of that in my opinion.

144
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,154
Specifically in our field.

145
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,690
And so I'll continue to talk
a little bit about that.

146
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,293
Now one of the reasons I'm
talkin' about curiosity today

147
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,827
is because I simply asked a lot

148
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,229
of practitioners
across our field

149
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,431
and I said okay what
is the X factor?

150
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,465
What is the thing in our field

151
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,732
that is likely to make someone

152
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,669
much more successful
than their peers?

153
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,902
And what you see
on the screen here

154
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,705
are several of the
responses I received

155
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,740
and I would say over
half of the responses

156
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,642
I received were kind
of in this vein.

157
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,576
The ability to learn.

158
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,378
The hunger for knowledge.

159
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,712
Persistence in education.

160
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,615
I particularly liked this one.

161
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,717
People who have a
beast inside them

162
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,786
that feeds on learning
and knowledge.

163
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,787
I like the sound of that right?

164
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,322
A beast.

165
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,357
And so I'm gonna stick with
that theme as we go forward.

166
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,659
And the beast is
ultimately curiosity.

167
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,494
And it's a beast that
lives inside of us,

168
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,297
and it's defined simply
by the desire to know.

169
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,865
So there's two
components there right?

170
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,100
The desire to know.

171
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,702
Know, knowledge,
gaining knowledge,

172
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,403
learning and cognition
that I just mentioned,

173
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,406
and desire which means there's
a motivational aspect to it.

174
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,275
So what that implies
is to some degree

175
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,945
there's a big sense of people
who succeed in this field,

176
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,880
it's simply a matter of
having enough motivation

177
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,048
to go out and grab the knowledge

178
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,483
that is needed to succeed in it.

179
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,552
That's particularly
useful in our field.

180
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,153
Again, things are
not written down.

181
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,455
It's very tacit knowledge.

182
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,090
Things aren't spoon
fed to us quite

183
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,457
as much as some other fields.

184
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,692
So we have to go
out and actively

185
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,194
seek it out and
want to learn it.

186
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,664
Now to understand curiosity,
I'll spend just quick minute

187
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,632
talkin' about
information gap theory

188
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,168
which is really
the leading theory,

189
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,570
there are a few
different theories.

190
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,105
In psychology there are
multiple theories on everything,

191
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,674
but probably the leading theory
on what explains curiosity

192
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,044
in psychology is what we
call information gap theory.

193
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,647
And I'll give you the quick
dollar store run down of that.

194
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,983
To understand information gap
theory you have to understand

195
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,885
that for any particular
knowledge domain,

196
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,320
and this could be all
of information security.

197
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,522
It can be programming,

198
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,789
or it can be a very
specific domain

199
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,658
like an individual
investigation.

200
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,893
Right?

201
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,660
For any of those domains
there's what you know,

202
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,631
and then there's your perception
of what you don't know.

203
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,299
It's not what you
truly don't know.

204
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,034
It's not all the knowledge
that's available out there

205
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,736
but it's your perception
of how much you don't know.

206
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,438
So those are two
specific set points.

207
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,640
Right?

208
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,143
And in between
them exists a gap.

209
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,044
And that's where the opportunity
for curiosity exists.

210
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,516
And what you have at this point,
is a sense of deprivation.

211
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,984
A sense of longing.

212
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,585
There's information I don't
have and I want to go after it.

213
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,189
Now, there's a subconscious
gamble that's going on here.

214
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,591
Because we don't pursue
every knowledge gap right?

215
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,428
We have a subconscious
gamble that says

216
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,797
to achieve this level of
knowledge I'm gonna have

217
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,599
to do this amount of things
and this will be the impact

218
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,601
and this will be
about a work required,

219
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,503
and this will be
the benefit right?

220
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,473
It's like a cost
benefit type trade off.

221
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,375
Now, we're not gonna
pursue all those things.

222
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,709
Some of 'em we might.

223
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,978
Speaking away from
information security I'll say,

224
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,713
I like to spend
time wood working.

225
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,249
And that's a neat thing because
I enjoy both the output,

226
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,717
I create things that are useful.

227
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,419
And I also enjoy
the process right?

228
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,620
It's not just about output it's

229
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,589
also about enjoyment
of the process.

230
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,991
But I enjoy both those
things so I'm persuaded,

231
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,994
I am favorable on the
subconscious gamble

232
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,596
to pursue wood
working knowledge.

233
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,467
Now something I don't know
a lot about is knitting.

234
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,633
Right?

235
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,302
I don't know anything
about knitting.

236
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,503
Surprise.

237
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,239
And so we have this
gap that exists

238
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,907
and I know that I will
probably not enjoy

239
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,642
the output of knitting.

240
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,311
I don't really need those things

241
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,114
and I will probably not enjoy
the process of it as well.

242
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,616
So because of that,

243
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,984
while I recognize that a
gap exists between those,

244
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,853
that opportunity for
curiosity is there,

245
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,454
I don't have genuine
interest in that.

246
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,822
So I'm not going to pursue it.

247
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,090
Right?

248
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,625
And so those are some
non technical examples

249
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,094
but applies again on a macro
scale about specific skills.

250
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,829
You may not be
interested in the process

251
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,931
or the outcome of
Malware analysis,

252
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,800
where as you may be
interested in both the process

253
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,769
and the outcome of
intelligence analysis

254
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,539
or SOC analysis or red
team pen testing type work,

255
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,740
and so on.

256
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,242
So there's a sense
of deprivation

257
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,477
and sometimes we choose
to pursue it and sometimes

258
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,380
we don't based generally
upon general interest.

259
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,616
Now the literature in
psychology tells us

260
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,049
a couple of other
things about curiosity

261
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,352
that kind of help define
it as a positive trait.

262
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,786
One of those is
that it's positively

263
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,723
correlated with intelligence.

264
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,290
Now, we're good with
smart folks in here

265
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,461
so we know that correlation
does not equal what?

266
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,295
- [All] Causation.

267
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,496
- Very good, causation.

268
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,997
Correlation does
not equal causation.

269
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,266
So as they're
correlated it doesn't

270
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,635
necessarily mean that
one causes the other.

271
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,436
However there is
additional evidence

272
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,605
to suggest that
someone who is curious

273
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,407
is likely to gain
knowledge at a faster rate.

274
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,775
Of course gaining
knowledge at a quick rate

275
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,343
doesn't necessarily
define intelligence.

276
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,578
The definition of intelligence

277
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,579
from a psychological standpoint

278
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,316
is very diverse and a hot topic

279
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,718
of debate dependin'
upon who you ask.

280
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,021
Psychology also tells us that

281
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,556
curiosity is positively
correlated with memory recall.

282
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,725
So if we learn something,
a piece of information,

283
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,928
whether it being in an
investigation or something else,

284
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,363
if we learn it because it's
motivated by curiosity,

285
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,032
we're more likely
to recall it easier.

286
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,333
We're going to
remember it better.

287
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,534
And that has to do with the type

288
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,369
of motivation that
curiosity represents.

289
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,272
And that's intrinsic
motivation in most cases.

290
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,541
We're internally motivated
to seek out that knowledge

291
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,176
so we will more likely
remember it versus

292
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,712
something where we're
extrinsically motivated.

293
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,881
The other thing that's
really interesting is

294
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,382
with really any trait,

295
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,617
a trait for it to be a trait has

296
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,286
to be regulated by something.

297
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,820
Right?

298
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,755
Otherwise any trait we have we
don't want it to go unchecked

299
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,990
'cause that's where you get into

300
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,558
the realm of things like
personality disorders.

301
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,860
So curiosity is regulated
by a strong trait

302
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,963
and to illustrate that I
want you to imagine that,

303
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,863
we've all probably been
in a scenario like this

304
00:09:58,864 --> 00:09:59,799
where you're walking
down the street

305
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,199
and you see a dog walking up.

306
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,269
And the dog walks up
to your really slowly

307
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,804
and it's walking very slowly

308
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,572
and maybe you reach down
because you want to pet it.

309
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,974
Or maybe you walk towards it and

310
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,242
the dog runs off in
the other direction.

311
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,077
Right?

312
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,911
It's scared of you.

313
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,844
It's fear.

314
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,380
So if we think about curiosity

315
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,616
as one side of the
evolutionary coin,

316
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,784
fear would be the other side.

317
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,120
That fear regulates curiosity.

318
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,890
Some things in nature don't
have a strong fear instinct.

319
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,393
That's the whole phrase
curiosity killed the cat.

320
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,861
Right?

321
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,997
So we have to think about
fear as the countering trait.

322
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,298
And that's important to realize

323
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,933
because fear
essentially limits us.

324
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,402
It limits and our
curiosity beast.

325
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,771
It kind of causes the start
to starve it sometime.

326
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,406
So I'll talk about more
of that in a minute.

327
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,108
But essentially curiosity
is a positive trait.

328
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,476
We do have things in
psychology literature

329
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,879
that do tell us that
and inform us of that.

330
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,148
Now the other thing
is that curiosity

331
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,283
generally speaking also
helps us describe what

332
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,585
I call the Jack
and Diane problem.

333
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,286
So you have Jack and Diane.

334
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,488
Two American kids growin'
up in the heartland.

335
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,690
(audience laughing)

336
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,091
Who wanted to be
intelligence analysts.

337
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,559
(audience laughing)

338
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,028
And let's say for all intensive
purposes everything's equal.

339
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,130
They have the exact same
background, same skill set,

340
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,865
same socioeconomic background.

341
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,501
Same training and then you
put them in the exact same job

342
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,002
with the same responsibilities,

343
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,271
and the exact same tasks and
you leave 'em there five years

344
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,140
and you come back later
and talk to the management

345
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,141
and you say how's it goin'?

346
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,110
And they say okay let's
take in this case Diane

347
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,280
is out performing Jack
in every single way

348
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,814
in their roles as
intelligence analysts.

349
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,884
And you ask okay,
what is the trait

350
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,954
that Diane has in this
case that has compelled

351
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,790
her to much greater success
and of course, no surprise.

352
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,193
I'm gonna say all things
being equal curiosity

353
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,627
is the prevailing
trait that exist there.

354
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,796
It's that desire to know.

355
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,030
That hunger for knowledge.

356
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,732
Diane's curiosity
beast is getting

357
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,367
fed at a more regular rate.

358
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,203
She's insatiably curious
about the task at hand.

359
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,704
(clears throat)

360
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,339
Now what the Jack and Diane
problem helps us realize

361
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,342
is that we think
about experience too
often in our own ways.

362
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,645
How do people normally
measure experience?

363
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,647
Years right?

364
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,348
I heard some people say it.

365
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,817
Years, right?

366
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,318
And that's really the
worst measure of experience

367
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,620
because just like the Jack
and Diane problem illustrates,

368
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,621
two people with the
exact same background

369
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,789
and same experience may excel

370
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,026
in dramatically different ways.

371
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,194
Right?

372
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,428
So what do we mean
when we say experience?

373
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,930
Well generally we
mean expertise.

374
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,032
But specifically diversity
and to some degree duration

375
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,302
but mostly diversity
of expertise.

376
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,570
That's generally
what we're talkin'

377
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,205
about when we talk
about experience.

378
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,706
So if we were to actually map

379
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,708
experience based
upon that premise,

380
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,411
over the course of a career we
might see something like this

381
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,713
where in the top would be Diane

382
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,048
and the bottom would be Jack.

383
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,417
And the defining
characteristic is curiosity.

384
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,652
So curiosity
essentially helps define

385
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:37,356
how quickly we gain
diversity of experience,

386
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,960
our diversity of
expertise AKA experience.

387
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,728
Now this manifests in
a couple different ways

388
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,497
and I kind of put it
on this chart here.

389
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,732
And notice we have
green is obviously good.

390
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,033
Red is bad.

391
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,001
I guess if you're
color blind green

392
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,736
is the top red is the bottom.

393
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,904
I probably could have
chosen better colors

394
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,773
for that but here we are.

395
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,509
And the defining characteristic
here is not experience.

396
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,077
It's actually curiosity.

397
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,713
Of course the ideal
quadrant of this

398
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,415
is the high curiosity,
high expertise,

399
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,319
high experience quadrant
at the top right

400
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,521
where someone excels.

401
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,656
But most of us
started or hopefully

402
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,424
we started right
across from that

403
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,494
in the high curiosity,
low experience area.

404
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,796
And that's fine, right?

405
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,164
The word I use to
describe that is jumpy.

406
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,299
We've all known
people in the SOC who,

407
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,401
they don't know what normal is
so everything looks malicious

408
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,769
and they're always
thinkin' everybody's tryin'

409
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,005
to hack into their stuff
and it's just like a,

410
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,140
it's a stock ticker or
something like that.

411
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,776
Some random periodic thing
and it's not malicious at all.

412
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,777
That's jumpiness
and that's okay.

413
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,181
A self awareness of
that jumpiness is
critically important

414
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,850
and even so mentorship
and strong leadership

415
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,151
to help put up a little
bit of guard rails

416
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,853
in that regard is super helpful.

417
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,988
Some coaching so to speak.

418
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,889
But jumpy's good.

419
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,391
You can work with jumpy.

420
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,626
What you can't work with is
ineffective or apathetic.

421
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,528
Ineffective being
someone who has

422
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,031
very little diversity of
expertise and low curiosity

423
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,732
so they're not gonna
gain that expertise

424
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,502
at a very quick rate at all.

425
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,304
And then apathetic is someone,

426
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,471
we've all known folks like this

427
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,940
who are really
experienced and maybe

428
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,008
they were really high curiosity
at one point in their life,

429
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,976
and then they kinda phoned it

430
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,978
in for whatever various reasons.

431
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,680
And they've essentially
become apathetic

432
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,783
and they relied to heavily
on their experience

433
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,751
and are more resistant
to gaining new knowledge

434
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,155
that especially conflicts
with that experience.

435
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,656
Right?

436
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,924
So this is kinda how I see
curiosity and experience

437
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,992
generally racking up
and curiosity again

438
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,429
has a dramatic impact on
our career development,

439
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,997
not just at the micro scale

440
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,899
with individual investigations
but the macro scale

441
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,834
and how we develop
our careers over time.

442
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,770
Not unlike Jack and Diane.

443
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,141
So, the natural
question here becomes

444
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,644
okay I know a little
bit about curiosity now,

445
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,613
but can I become curiouser?

446
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,114
Can I become more curious?

447
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,683
And I think the answer is
generally speaking yes.

448
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,086
And I want to talk about a few
of the ways we can do that.

449
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,222
Before we do it I have to
talk about measuring curiosity

450
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,257
because any time you want to
increase the level of something

451
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,460
you probably need to be able
to measure it to some degree

452
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,128
so you can
scientifically validate

453
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,730
if you're actually
increasing things

454
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,998
because you have base lines.

455
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,466
You can do controlled
experiments et cetera

456
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,700
and I won't get
too much into that

457
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,903
but I will say from a
physiological sense,

458
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,839
we can measure
curiosity via fMRI.

459
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,742
So fMRI is a relatively
newer medical technology

460
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,645
wherein we can measure
the increased activity

461
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,545
in certain regions of the brain.

462
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,848
It's a very expensive thing it's

463
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,483
not super accessible
to researchers.

464
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,917
But there are a lot of
researchers who are doin' it

465
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,654
and I believe it was Stanford
who did this research

466
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,622
and they basically found
what are essentially

467
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,123
the curiosity
centers of the brain.

468
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,494
The places in the brain
wherein when someone is

469
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,363
more curious in a
particular scenario

470
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,332
that high levels of
activity are seen.

471
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,301
Those three areas
are the mid brain,

472
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,770
the nucleus accumbens and
the parahippocampal gyrus.

473
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,738
Now I tell you that not
because it's useful to you but

474
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,441
because saying parahippocampal
gyrus makes me feel smart.

475
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,375
(audience laughing)

476
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,843
I take it where I can get it.

477
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:48,814
So you see those highlighted
on the screen there.

478
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,483
Now that said, not everybody
can measure things with fMRI

479
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,253
so another area of
psychological research

480
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,588
is how do we measure
this via simple testing?

481
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,856
Right?

482
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,325
And there are a lot
of ways to do that.

483
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,592
Generally speaking their
focused on measuring things

484
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,096
in terms of curiosity
as generalized trait.

485
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,931
Not specifically applied
to an individual field

486
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,533
but as a generalized trait.

487
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,335
And it works to some degree.

488
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,938
It's psychomagically
valid but only just so.

489
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,206
It's not necessarily
one of those things

490
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,275
that we rely on
too super heavily.

491
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,077
There are a few
different ways to do it.

492
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,980
I say that they're not
situationally specific here

493
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,982
because to be more
specific they need

494
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,449
to be applied to more
specific scenarios.

495
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,852
So we don't necessarily have
that intelligence analysis yet.

496
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,554
I think we will at some point.

497
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,055
We're just not quite there yet.

498
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,757
And we don't honestly have a
lot of people lookin' at this

499
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,059
with those types of
skills right now.

500
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,761
So, we'll get there.

501
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,496
But one of the leading
examples of this

502
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,264
is the curiosity and
exploration inventory

503
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,566
now in its second version.

504
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,501
So I took this and I
said hey let's actually

505
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,036
let's do some numbers with this,

506
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,938
and I asked some
interesting questions

507
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,706
and one of those
I asked was okay,

508
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,475
are information
security practitioners,

509
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,612
generally speaking more
curious per this scale?

510
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,016
So I did that with in
this case about 275 folks

511
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,284
which is a reasonable
sample size.

512
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,620
I would want to do
more before I publish

513
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,188
a paper on it or
anything like that.

514
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,956
It's reasonable but not great.

515
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,026
And I went across several fields

516
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,395
and you see at the
bottom we have security

517
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,896
and then above that we
have general technology.

518
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,563
So like network
admin, sis admins,

519
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,066
non security practitioners,

520
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,635
and then practitioners of
the law or of medicine.

521
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,069
What I found amongst my groups,

522
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,972
was that yes in
this case security,

523
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:24,042
folks do seem to be more curious
per this particular scale.

524
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,244
Now, I add per this
particular scale

525
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,146
because if you want to
learn more about this

526
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,782
you need to go and research
the scale on your self

527
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,083
and learn what its
strengths or weaknesses are.

528
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,887
That's an important part
of this type of science.

529
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,989
Now the results of this
don't surprise me too much.

530
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,457
I would guess that
security folks

531
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,192
are more curious
generally speaking

532
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,795
because again security
knowledge is mostly tacit,

533
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,329
it's not spoon fed to us.

534
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,264
We have to actively seek it
out to be good at our jobs.

535
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,701
Whereas that's not necessarily
the case with medicine

536
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,672
or with law where the knowledge
is a lot more explicit

537
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,575
and written out and a
little bit easier to come by

538
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,111
versus what we have in security.

539
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,446
Now the next
question I asked was

540
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,947
inside the realm of security.

541
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,849
We obviously have all these
different specializations.

542
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,951
So have red team, blue
team, et cetera et cetera.

543
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,420
I said were there
specific groups

544
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,688
within security
practitioners that

545
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,223
were more curious then others?

546
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,758
Does anybody have
a thought on which

547
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,027
group within security
practitioners

548
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,496
is more curious than others?

549
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,730
Somebody said red team?

550
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,033
(audience mumbling)

551
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,301
IR?

552
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,168
Okay so I'll tell you
my guess was red team.

553
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,637
That's that would've
been my guess.

554
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,274
Which, so I was very
surprised by the results.

555
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,443
So you see here we have the

556
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,845
general security
industry at the top.

557
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,913
We have people who would
consider themselves generalists.

558
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,549
More half network
admin half security

559
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,917
people than the second group.

560
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,019
And then we have NSM,
IR and pen testing.

561
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,754
I don't have an
adequate sample size yet

562
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,122
to report on specifically
enough people who

563
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,758
identify primarily
only as intel folks.

564
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,960
Most people do
intel as a function

565
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,761
of these other
things in our field.

566
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,230
But this is the
results I came out with

567
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,764
and I was very surprised
to see pen test

568
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,867
was actually lower than
some of the other things.

569
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,537
So as is the way with
this type of data,

570
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,972
the results were
not as I expected.

571
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,473
I was welcoming of being wrong.

572
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,941
That's always a good thing.

573
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,843
But then I kinda had to think
backwards and think okay,

574
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,945
how could these
results be justified?

575
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,813
And I think where I'm
at on this right now

576
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,683
is generally has to do
with reward systems.

577
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,252
And pen testing a reward system

578
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,020
is very clear and observable.

579
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,954
Right?

580
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,889
You either get in or you don't.

581
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,322
You get the access or you don't.

582
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,591
You get to the particular
information asset or you don't.

583
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,659
And it's a pretty
clear reward system,

584
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,130
which I think has an
adverse effect on curiosity.

585
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,866
Whereas in NSM and
even to some degree IR,

586
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,969
but particularly NSM you
never know if you're winning.

587
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,471
Right?

588
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,672
You never know if you're
gonna get a reward at all.

589
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,073
Some people go many many years

590
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,509
in their NSM or
alert analysis career

591
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,644
and they never know if they,

592
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,379
they never catch
anything and they never

593
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,812
know if they're
doin' a good job.

594
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,283
And I think that to some
degree can increase curiosity.

595
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,385
I think in some situations it
can have a negative effect.

596
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,987
But that's what the
data's telling me now.

597
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,056
A sample size of this
group's about 200.

598
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,524
I want to continue
to do more research,

599
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,593
break out more individual groups

600
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,496
there and see what
I can find out.

601
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,566
And maybe even add some
additional surveys to this

602
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,201
just to learn more about
the differences there.

603
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,835
'Cause that was very
surprising to me.

604
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,571
I think most people
who when I asked

605
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,672
that a minute ago said red team.

606
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,340
That would have made more sense.

607
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,543
But I guess not so red
teamer's can eat it.

608
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,779
(laughing)

609
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,416
Now, growing curiosity.

610
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,649
So this is the
part I think a lot

611
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,885
of people are the most
interested about is

612
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,621
how can we be more
curious people?

613
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,590
And what those fMRI
studies that I talked

614
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,192
about earlier said
that was particularly

615
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,461
interesting in the
context of those

616
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,029
and I'll provide
links to these papers.

617
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,231
You can read about it yourself.

618
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,967
But they said curiosity peaks

619
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,401
when you believe you
are equally likely

620
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,303
to know or to not
know something.

621
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,571
Right?

622
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,005
So what that is
saying essentially

623
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,708
is that requisite knowledge
on a topic matters.

624
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,409
So if you think of
what you're likely

625
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,711
to know about something in a

626
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,579
given investigation
or a given scenario,

627
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,248
if you are likely,
if you believe you're

628
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,749
not gonna know
anything about it,

629
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,484
zero percent you're not gonna
be very curious about it.

630
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,218
If you believe you know
everything about it,

631
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,787
then you're not gonna be
very curious about it.

632
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:56,822
But if you're in
that middle range,

633
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,857
that 40 to 60% range of likely

634
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,459
or not likely to know something,

635
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,727
like you have enough
requisite knowledge,

636
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,829
then you're gonna be
more curious about it.

637
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,498
And this is backed up
by those fMRI results.

638
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,000
So I actually want to go through

639
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,334
a couple quick examples of this

640
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,503
and we'll start with
curiosity in daily life.

641
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,971
So let's say you're
talkin to me,

642
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,940
and you ask me hey Chris
what did you do last night?

643
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,174
Right?

644
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,643
I could have done many
many things last night.

645
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:18,910
You have no idea
what I did so you

646
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,412
don't really have any
requisite knowledge.

647
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,613
Matter of fact
you probably don't

648
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,814
necessarily even care
about the answer.

649
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,483
You're probably just
makin' small talk right?

650
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,884
Fair enough we all do it.

651
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,153
So at this point your
curiosity is not very peaked.

652
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,355
But let's say I
answer and I say okay,

653
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,591
I went to a concert at
Mercedes-Benz Stadium

654
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,458
in Atlanta and I just
leave it at that.

655
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,694
Right?

656
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,495
Well now you have some
requisite knowledge,

657
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,428
information about it.

658
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,930
You know I went to a concert.

659
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,832
You know Mercedes-Benz Stadium
is the big football stadium.

660
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,668
There's only so many acts
that would perform there.

661
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,235
Maybe you know a
little bit about music.

662
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,937
You might could guess
who was performing there.

663
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,139
Right?

664
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,106
You have some
knowledge of things

665
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,675
that will peak your curiosity.

666
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,076
You don't have
all the knowledge,

667
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,577
because lets say
instead of this answer

668
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,179
I gave you this answer.

669
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,881
I went to a concert at
Mercedes-Benz Stadium

670
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,482
and saw Garth Brooks.

671
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,450
Right?

672
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,751
Well now you know where I went.

673
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,953
You know what I did and
that's gonna essentially

674
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,456
crush curiosity for
that specific scenario.

675
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,824
Now you may have an interest
in Garth Brooks or the concert.

676
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,093
You may generally
be interested in

677
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,361
how it went or
something like that

678
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,662
or that may be your
follow up question.

679
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,964
But specific to this
piece of knowledge,

680
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,935
by selectively excluding
who I saw at the concert,

681
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,337
I'm peaking curiosity
because I'm giving

682
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,373
you just enough information
to peak curiosity

683
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,508
ad ask an interesting question.

684
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,743
Right?

685
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,145
Let's look at something
a little more topical.

686
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,014
Let' say you're
looking at a host

687
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,983
and you find a file that
doesn't look familiar.

688
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,418
Now, truthfully
most of the files

689
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,421
on an operating system are
not familiar to us right?

690
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,323
There are tens of thousands
of files on Windows,

691
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,360
and we don't know what most of
them do without Googling it.

692
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,293
Right?

693
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,528
That's a fair assessment.

694
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,996
So unless the file is
found in a weird place,

695
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,032
or has a weird name, or
there's something other else

696
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,600
about it that tells
us it's suspicious,

697
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,967
if we just see a file
that doesn't look familiar

698
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,169
we're probably
gonna gloss over it.

699
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,471
Right?

700
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,839
So we're not very
curious about it.

701
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,806
We don't have enough information

702
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,274
that makes us curious about it.

703
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,542
But let's say in this case,

704
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,177
let's say we found the
file in the context

705
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,980
of finding a scheduled
task that we don't expect.

706
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,482
So we know our sis admins.

707
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,183
We know that we shouldn't
see any scheduled tasks

708
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,184
that we don't expect.

709
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,386
And we find a scheduled task

710
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,754
that's on a system that
links to this file.

711
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,390
Well many of us know
that scheduled tasks

712
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,459
are often used for persistence
mechanisms for the bad guys.

713
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,161
And now we have just
enough knowledge

714
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,563
where we believe again
right in the middle of here,

715
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,999
where we're equally
likely to know or not know

716
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,701
whether this is malicious
or how malicious

717
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,236
it is or what it does.

718
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,104
And that is where peaked
curiosity is gonna live.

719
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,472
So instead of zero
percent or 100%

720
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,508
we're in that 40 to 60% range.

721
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,510
And we're likely
to be more curious

722
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,479
about this based upon the
context of what it was found.

723
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,015
And context is the
key word here right?

724
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,452
Because we need that
context and our tools,

725
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,686
in order to peak curiosity
at the right times

726
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,723
so we can make sure we
pursue the right things.

727
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,726
So if you are a, if
you build your own sim,

728
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,127
or you work for a sim builder,

729
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,294
or you work for a
vendor or you're

730
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,596
considering becoming a vendor,

731
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,565
I urge you consider context at

732
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,467
all points of the investigation,

733
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,869
and not everything has
to create an alert.

734
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,137
Right?

735
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,371
Not everything is
on alert worthy.

736
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,340
I think during the SSL
and TLS talk yesterday,

737
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,976
it was mentioned the
concept of decoration.

738
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,144
Right?

739
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,646
That's something that's
often overlooked,

740
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,447
is taking that and adding
additional context to it

741
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,350
so that that's available and
not necessarily alert worthy

742
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,886
but available in the context
of other investigations.

743
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,589
Because the context of
this file is involved

744
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,225
in a scheduled task is
critically critically important

745
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,060
to peaking the
curiosity and pushing us

746
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,861
to pursue the
investigation further.

747
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,363
Right?

748
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,165
In investigations generally
we are own worst enemies.

749
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,734
It's our biases and
our lack of curiosity

750
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,102
in some cases that fail
to push us forward,

751
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,172
but this type of thing,
the appropriate context,

752
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,807
is gonna let us continue forward

753
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,542
and make sure we
don't miss things.

754
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,279
Very quickly (clears throat),

755
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,747
we talk about feeding the beast

756
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,350
and having that requisite
knowledge that I talked about,

757
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,885
and feeding the beast in
that regard is important

758
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,221
but also you don't want to
starve the beast as well.

759
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,822
And that's where
something called

760
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,024
rapid gap awareness comes in.

761
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,758
So I mentioned we have
our knowledge point

762
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,328
and our reference point
and there's obviously

763
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,562
a gap between those two things

764
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,897
and I think most of
us know who have been

765
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,265
in the field for
awhile that really,

766
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,301
especially with information
security and intelligence work,

767
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,803
the longer you do this the more

768
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,872
you realize you
don't know about it.

769
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,106
Right?

770
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,274
And that's really
a sign of expertise

771
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,207
is not just knowing
what you know

772
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,576
but knowing what you don't know.

773
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,879
So even though your
knowledge may grow over time,

774
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,147
the gap is also gonna
grow and it's generally

775
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,749
gonna out pace it
in this field right?

776
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,950
The gap of things you don't know

777
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,452
is generally going
to do that and

778
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,687
that's gonna happen slowly
over the course of a career,

779
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,356
but it doesn't
always happen slowly

780
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,091
and I'll give you
an example in IT

781
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,325
and security that I see a lot.

782
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,595
Someone maybe doesn't have
a lot of coding experience,

783
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,963
and I say you know what I want

784
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,164
to learn to write Yython code.

785
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,099
That would be good
for my career.

786
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,634
I could do some cool stuff.

787
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,902
That would be neat.

788
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,537
So they go out and they
write their hello world.

789
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,238
They do some if then
else statements.

790
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,073
They make some
little dinky things

791
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,275
that are probably not too useful

792
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,509
but they're good
learning exercises.

793
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,911
And then they say okay I want

794
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,479
to do something really
practical, really real world.

795
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,447
Maybe they want to
write a screen scraper,

796
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,015
maybe some type of
data analysis tool.

797
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,351
So they start Googling
around for examples.

798
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,554
They inevitably end
up on stack overflow,

799
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,423
and then they run into the world
of okay what are functions?

800
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,392
I don't understand
how classes work.

801
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,460
Why are there 14
external libraries?

802
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,030
And why is everybody doing this
and arguing with each other

803
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,498
about how there are
eight different ways

804
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,300
and every way is better
but nobody can explain why?

805
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,334
Right?

806
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,168
Stack overflow in a nutshell.

807
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,402
(laughs)

808
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,939
But so they find
that and basically

809
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,308
what happens at that point
whereas they're learning a lot

810
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,343
and their knowledge point
and their reference point,

811
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,377
maybe they're gettin'
closer together,

812
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,445
then all of a sudden,

813
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,616
that reference point of
what they don't know,

814
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,484
grows dramatically.

815
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,686
Right?

816
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,919
They thought they're
makin' progress

817
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,355
and then it just
grows dramatically

818
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,590
and they realize wow there's
so much I don't know.

819
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,259
The rate at which that
growth happens matters.

820
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,460
And that's where we get into

821
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,895
this concept of
rapid gap awareness.

822
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,163
And as you see here the red line

823
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,732
as awareness grows very quickly,

824
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:44,069
it basically causes the
motivational aspect of curiosity

825
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,937
to have the inverse effect.

826
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,405
Right?

827
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,107
So it's almost less about
starving the curiosity beast,

828
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,309
and more about kickin'
him right in the stomach.

829
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,577
Right?

830
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,479
It's very massively
demotivating thing.

831
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,114
And this is where most learning

832
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,084
from a topical and a
skills perspective fails.

833
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,085
Right?

834
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,019
That's where the
most of the time

835
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,220
the guy was tryin' to learn,

836
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,455
the guy or girl was
tryin' to learn Python.

837
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,624
They run into this and
then they walk away

838
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,858
from it and they
never come back.

839
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,393
Or they come back
two years later

840
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,195
and the same thing happens
over and over again right?

841
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,697
So this is one of the big things
that's working against us.

842
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,532
Now the good thing is
simply by being aware

843
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,936
of rapid gap awareness and
knowing how it effects you,

844
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,337
you're better equipped
to deal with it,

845
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,172
and particularly those
of you who are managers,

846
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,874
you're better equipped
to recognize it

847
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,510
in the folks you
manage or your peers.

848
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,611
Right?

849
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,846
That's very
critically important.

850
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,080
So recognizing that
is very important

851
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,816
to make sure you're
preventing gut punches

852
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,386
to the curiosity beast.

853
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,320
(sighs)

854
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,553
So we're about to wrap up.

855
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:37,756
I'll mention a couple
of other points related

856
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,759
to feeding and or not
starving the best.

857
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,561
And I'll also mention feeding
the beast is important.

858
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,629
Not starving it
is also important.

859
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,966
But also binge and purge
is not good either.

860
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,167
Right?

861
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,401
We don't want to feed
the beast one day

862
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,270
and then kick him in
the gut the next day.

863
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,838
So, that's important.

864
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,173
One of the things I mentioned

865
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,676
was that fear
regulates curiosity.

866
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,211
The number one way
I see that manifest,

867
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,614
is by fear of asking questions.

868
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,015
And we've all been
there in school,

869
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,184
where the teachers
talkin' about something

870
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,019
and then all of a
sudden they lose you.

871
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:08,953
Right?

872
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:09,888
And you have a question and you

873
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,089
want to ask it but you don't.

874
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,256
And you probably
don't ask it because

875
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,758
one you're afraid
you're gonna look dumb.

876
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:14,693
Right?

877
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,960
There are people in the room who

878
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,162
may or may not be
smarter than you,

879
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,165
you don't want to appear
dumb in that regard.

880
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,299
Whether or not you will or not

881
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,901
that's your perception
of the matter.

882
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,436
And maybe the other
thing is maybe

883
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,669
you just zoned out for a moment

884
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,871
and maybe the teacher
said the thing

885
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,406
that you needed to
hear but you missed it.

886
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,541
And you don't want to be scolded

887
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,975
by the teacher
because you zoned out.

888
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,209
Right?

889
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,578
So fear in that case
is preventing you

890
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,812
from asking the question that

891
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,948
you need to spur
on your knowledge,

892
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,451
but it's also killing
your curiosity.

893
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,553
It's starving your curiosity
beast in that regard.

894
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,688
So bein' aware of
that's important.

895
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,123
You can kind of help
self regulate your fear

896
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,791
but I think it's
a liberating thing

897
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,226
for people when they recognize

898
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,795
that hey this fear
is preventing me

899
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,831
from my curiosity form thriving.

900
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,865
It's preventing me from learning

901
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:54,799
about this particular thing.

902
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,033
Preventing me from pursing this

903
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,902
particular aspect
of an investigation.

904
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,673
Liberating that type of fear
is a good and positive thing.

905
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,508
Me talkin' about
it, that's easy.

906
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,509
Actually doin' it is hard.

907
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,443
I recognize that.

908
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,945
I fall victim to it as well.

909
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,213
Here in a minute I'm gonna
ask ya'll for questions

910
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,781
and there will be folks
who won't ask questions

911
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,916
because they're afraid
of something right?

912
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,953
And I would encourage you
to try and suppress that

913
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,421
as best you can and
ask as many questions

914
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,056
as you can within the
time we have allotted.

915
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,792
But recognizing that fear
is what regulates curiosity

916
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,226
is the key thing here.

917
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,730
Cognitive resources also matter.

918
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,900
We have this concept of
being mentally tired.

919
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,135
Right?

920
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,770
You do a really
hard job all day,

921
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,371
that's really mentally tasking.

922
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,572
You get to the end of the day.

923
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,774
You just you can't
handle anything else.

924
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,841
You just want to zone
out and watch TV.

925
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:37,876
That's a real thing.

926
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,010
Right?

927
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,211
Our cognitive
resources are limited.

928
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,379
And I often think about
cognitive resources

929
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,615
in terms of a gas tank right?

930
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,283
You only have so
much in a given day

931
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,684
and it depletes over time
and there's things you can do

932
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,686
to kind of fill it
back up a little bit.

933
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,187
You can eat.

934
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,322
Obviously the brain runs on
glucose and some other things.

935
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,123
So eating and
nutrition's important.

936
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,093
You can take a nap.

937
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,061
That's helpful for
some people as well.

938
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,764
But that matters and you also,

939
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,466
the really important
thing I think for us here,

940
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,668
is thinking about that also
in terms of miles per gallon.

941
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:05,603
Right?

942
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,071
Of that cognitive resource tank.

943
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,940
So you can only apply
so much attention

944
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,209
and focus to a particular thing.

945
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,677
And if you think
about your attention

946
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,579
which is how you apply
these cognitive resources

947
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,248
as a spotlight and the more
intense that spotlight is,

948
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,485
the lower your cognitive
miles per gallon are.

949
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,919
Right?

950
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,421
So if you have one single
task, one single investigation,

951
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,123
maybe you're just looking at
alerts all day and every day,

952
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,393
and you're intensely
focused all day,

953
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,228
your miles per gallon on
your cognitive resources

954
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,529
are really really low
and that negatively

955
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,298
effects your curiosity
and it's for that reason

956
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,233
I generally recommend
basically instead

957
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,635
of havin' your foot on the
gas full throttle all day,

958
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,903
you kind of vary
it a little bit.

959
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:39,971
The best way to
do that is not to

960
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,706
not work for a couple hours.

961
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,341
Most of our employers
wouldn't like that.

962
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,844
But it's more specifically to
have multiple work streams.

963
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,346
Because when you switch context

964
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,215
between work streams
you vary your focus.

965
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,616
Right?

966
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,885
So that's again, 100% throttle,
now you're back to 20,

967
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,220
to 50 back to 20
that sorta thing.

968
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,488
And you're getting
better miles per gallon.

969
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,190
It also allows you to
get a fresh perspective

970
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,592
on what you're looking at,

971
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,093
which I believe is
something Carmen mentioned

972
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,628
in her key note yesterday
was that fresh perspective,

973
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,063
looking at things with a
little bit of a clean slate,

974
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,399
and having multiple work
streams is critically important.

975
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,868
So one of the
things I spend a lot

976
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,336
of time consulting in
SOCS and one of the things

977
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,004
I tell people is if
you have analysts

978
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,606
who their only job
is ever looking

979
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,241
at alerts and that's
all they ever do,

980
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,709
first of all they're gonna
burn out very quickly

981
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,278
but also you're massively
under utilizing them

982
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,914
because you're getting
very low miles per gallon

983
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,049
in terms of their
cognitive work load

984
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,719
and it's crushing, starving
their curiosity beast.

985
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,054
So most multiple work
streams is important.

986
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,323
I recommend at any given
time anybody in our field

987
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,526
should have three tasks that
they can switch between.

988
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,794
Two to four's the sweet spot.

989
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,296
So three's right in
the middle of that.

990
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:43,201
Finally, gaining exposure
to new rabbit holes.

991
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,502
Right?

992
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,870
Back to the Alice in
Wonderland example.

993
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,207
A lot of us here,

994
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,842
we're all here because we're
interested in intelligence

995
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,744
and it's great to read
everything you can
about intelligence

996
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,014
but often times we
have to realize and
step back and realize

997
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,650
we are a much smaller cog in
what is a much greater picture.

998
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,986
Thomas mentioned that this
morning in his key note

999
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,022
in so many words
where and sometimes

1000
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,456
we really need to
step back and look

1001
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,925
at the global perspective
at what's happening,

1002
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,894
and that often means combining
and fusing different ideas

1003
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,563
from different places to
get fresh perspective.

1004
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,766
So if you're into intel
analysis, that's great.

1005
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,534
But you need to read
and be involved with

1006
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,604
and understand other
facets of what we do.

1007
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,905
For me that's psychology.

1008
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,173
That's the thing
I'm interested in

1009
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,242
and merging that with
information security

1010
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,177
and learning from a much
more well established field

1011
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,146
and combining those things
has been really useful

1012
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,514
for me and I hope
as a result really

1013
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,616
useful to many of ya'll as well.

1014
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,084
But it doesn't have
to be a history.

1015
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,987
I mean Thomas this morning,
he's a historian right?

1016
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,789
He's talking about history
and combining those things.

1017
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,758
And most of our history, not
only is it yet to be defined,

1018
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,727
we're yet to define how
we're going to define it

1019
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,095
because our field is so young.

1020
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,997
So there's so much
opportunity there.

1021
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,832
It can be math with advanced

1022
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,100
statistics and
advanced detection.

1023
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,702
Any of these other fields,

1024
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,037
bringing those in and
learning about those things,

1025
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,106
it's very valuable
and I would also add

1026
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,507
the thing I don't
have on the slide

1027
00:32:56,507 --> 00:33:00,011
is learning about social
strife and economies

1028
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,745
and places where things are not

1029
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,781
as great as they
are in this country.

1030
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,183
Right?

1031
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,684
People who struggle and
learning about those struggles,

1032
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,353
and learning about how what
we do effects those struggles,

1033
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,520
I spend a lot of time thinking

1034
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,589
about that in regards
to rural areas.

1035
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,859
And it puts into
perspective not only how

1036
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,028
what we do is so
important sometimes,

1037
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,031
but also what we do sometimes
can also be so disconnected

1038
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,533
from problems that
really really matter

1039
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:26,603
and maybe we can apply our
skill sets in unique ways

1040
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,973
to do cool things
about those as well

1041
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,942
which I think is a really
neat thing to try to do.

1042
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,979
So, all told you have
a beast inside you.

1043
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,481
It's the curiosity beast.

1044
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,982
I've talked about
some strategies

1045
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,651
on how you can feed it.

1046
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,855
How you can try to
avoid gut punching it.

1047
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,789
I think that's it.

1048
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:45,723
My name's Chris Sanders.

1049
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,524
That's Mayfield, Kentucky.

1050
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,324
Thank you all folks.

1051
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,228
(audience clapping)

1052
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,964
(dramatic music)
