1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,370
(uplifting music)

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,178
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,382
- Kyle's introduction I think
did more than anything else.

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:19,386
The only extra part of
bonafides I will give you is

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,455
I did have ramen for lunch today

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,358
and I'm fairly certain I'm
getting dragged to have ramen

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,728
for dinner tonight, which I
think may be largely based

8
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,864
on the fact that I
am giving this talk

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,800
but I count it a
win right there.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,068
So we're doing pretty
well right there.

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:41,041
Secondly, I'll tell you this
is a talk about a metaphor

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,010
and I'm always curious
about how people come

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,480
to doing talks and what
the point of it is and

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,081
I'll actually tell you this one.

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,718
I was going on a job
interview and they said,

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,954
we want you to do a talk
as part of the interview.

17
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,489
And I said, oh that's cool.

18
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,090
And I'm sitting around with
my friends and I'm going,

19
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,827
what should I talk about
and one friend says well

20
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,129
you should talk about
work and tell them

21
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,598
about threat intelligence and
whatever they want you to do.

22
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,002
And another friend of mine
says you should do ramen.

23
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,437
You should make ramen
and tell them about it.

24
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,407
And then my wife goes,
but can you do both?

25
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:16,843
So here it goes.

26
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,847
First of all, what is ramen?

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,416
Has anybody had ramen?

28
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,352
Okay, for those of you
that have your hands up,

29
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,887
no keep them up keep them up.

30
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,289
For those of you that
have your hands up,

31
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,924
how many of you had
only had the type

32
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,561
of ramen Kyle mentioned, the
little like 16 cent, you know,

33
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,362
like comes in a brick.

34
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,933
Okay, how many people have
had like good big ramen

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,167
that gets made, okay.

36
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,103
A little bit more people.

37
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,707
Funny story, the like in a
brick ramen is not kind of

38
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,642
as cheap and terrible
as we think it is.

39
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,277
It's actually a really
interesting problem

40
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,813
that was being solved.

41
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,650
So post World War II, the
Americans had showed up

42
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,888
in Japan and brought
bread because it's
what American's eat.

43
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,456
So we brought bread.

44
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,092
Turns out people in Japan
didn't eat a lot of bread,

45
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,794
they eat noodles and in fact,

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,863
they would generally
have a local place

47
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,297
they could go and get noodles.

48
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,200
But has anyone made noodles?

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,102
It's hard, it's a lot
of work and it turns out

50
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,405
it was mostly a young
man's kind of thing

51
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,774
to put in the effort
to make noodles.

52
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,111
Well, you're just post
a huge war so turns out

53
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,214
you don't have a lot of
working young men around.

54
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,584
So a guy by the name of
Momofuku Ando came up

55
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,354
with this idea of
making these noodles and

56
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,323
then frying them and what
the frying did was took all

57
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,592
the moisture out and
that actually made them

58
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,227
so they could just
send them to people,

59
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,930
they were shelf stable,
which anyone will tell you

60
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,000
fresh noodles are
not shelf stable.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,402
Those little packs that we think
of them as just cheap stuff

62
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,939
you eat when you're in
college, literally fed Japan

63
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,207
for like 10 years.

64
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,376
It's actually a
really cool thing.

65
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,844
Um, but that's ramen.

66
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,780
It's a Japanese soup
based on a Chinese noodle.

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,248
There's a lot of varieties.

68
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,218
We can talk about that, I'm
happy to nerd out on it.

69
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,920
So that's kind of
a hard question.

70
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,226
I think that's a harder
question to answer in some cases

71
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,428
but I love being here and
seeing people answer it.

72
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,364
To me, it's about a process
that by which we try

73
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,266
to understand our adversary and

74
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,734
then tailor our defense to it.

75
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,505
Those two things don't seem
to have a lot in common

76
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,875
but I think there's some things
that we can put together.

77
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,177
Ultimately in this case,
I'm gonna teach you about

78
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,247
ramen and threat intel with
the idea of understanding

79
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,618
the combination of tools,
people, process, inputs

80
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,321
and I know I moved those
around but it's in my head,

81
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,457
that makes a threat
intelligence capability and

82
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,025
also that makes
a delicious soup.

83
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,329
So it's a good thing I'm
the last talk of the day.

84
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,030
I think Jennifer did
that on purpose because

85
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm hoping you'll be
hungry by the end.

86
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,335
So first, let's
talk about tools.

87
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,338
I added a lot of
definitions to this.

88
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,773
Coming up with a definition
for the word tools,

89
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,475
like it's such a
fundamental thing.

90
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,710
What's a tool?

91
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,880
Well, if you ask
Marriam-Webster it's

92
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,192
That's like the most
abstract thing ever.

93
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,328
It's essentially saying it's
a thing you use to do a thing.

94
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,865
Which is accurate and
I couldn't come up

95
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,568
with a better definition
but it's pretty abstract

96
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,536
and a lot of what we're gonna
talk about is those types

97
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,973
of very abstract concepts
but think about your tools.

98
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,909
So what about for making ramen?

99
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,378
What are the tools you need?

100
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,979
And I'm gonna do kind of this
back and forth thing here.

101
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,249
So for the ramen recipe that
I'm gonna share with you,

102
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,818
we have a couple different
tools that we need.

103
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,322
Tongs are pretty necessary
because it's boiling hot liquid,

104
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,057
you don't really want
to reach in there.

105
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,826
Uh, ladle, spider,
knives but then

106
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,762
there's even some
basic infrastructure.

107
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,765
You have the ability to heat
water, things like that.

108
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,735
But what about your tools for
cyber threat intelligence?

109
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,936
What are you using?

110
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,638
Have you thought about
how those fit into

111
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,176
what your needs are and what
the actions you're taking are?

112
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,880
By the way, one extra little
kitchen tool that's great,

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,115
the infrared thermometer.

114
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,117
If someone would have told
me, I have a laser gun

115
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,620
in the kitchen, I would
have never believed it but

116
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,954
that's exactly what this is.

117
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,489
I really should have
brought it because

118
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,292
it would have made a nice,
I guess I can use this but

119
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,161
I could have brought
that instead.

120
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,129
Anyway, totally recommend it.

121
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,833
Tools for CTI, what do we got?

122
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,436
First of all, I think
when you talk about

123
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,471
when we thick about cyber
threat intelligence tools

124
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,608
what a lot of us think at first
is a threat intel platform.

125
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,677
Well all it is, is a database.

126
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,580
And that's simple based on the
idea that in a lot of cases,

127
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,582
in my perspective, what we
call cyber threat intelligence

128
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,752
is literally just
incident response

129
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,122
where we wrote stuff down
and referenced over it again.

130
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,360
The number of cases where I
look at an incident take place

131
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,595
and someone goes, yeah I
think we might know something

132
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,496
about that.

133
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,668
Having records and knowing
what you know about that,

134
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,204
a previous incident is
incredibly important.

135
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,374
So for that, we have
something like a tip.

136
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,910
I just put up some examples
of ones that I've used

137
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,213
that are kind of
quick to get going.

138
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,015
If you have something
that fits this bill

139
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,683
use that, that's great.

140
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,320
If you don't, I'd consider
something like yeti.

141
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,890
A workbench, something
that let's you manipulate

142
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,227
the intelligence you
do have available.

143
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,328
Something that lets you pull
in information from lots

144
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,665
of different places, use
it to build conclusions.

145
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,035
Another kind of cool workbench
tool, if you haven't used it,

146
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,005
is timesketch for
understanding temperol

147
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,807
as opposed to graph based.

148
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,444
But are you thinking about
what tools you have available

149
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,580
to help you understand the
intelligence you're pulling in

150
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,417
from all your resources
to come to conclusions?

151
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,686
Do you know what tools
you're using for detection?

152
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,791
Two of my favorites
are YARA and SNORT.

153
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,526
YARA for doing
file based things.

154
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,461
SNORT for doing
network based things.

155
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,664
Understanding how those fit
in with what you can deploy

156
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,033
inside your environment.

157
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,039
Lastly, places you can pull
3rd party information from.

158
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,442
I'm a big fan of Passive
Total and Shodan.

159
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,146
But the key to this is not
any of the individual tools,

160
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,382
it's the understanding
of how they work together

161
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,751
and how I can use them to
answer questions that I have

162
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,686
on a routine basis.

163
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,256
If someone comes to me and
says, hey here's this IP address

164
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,724
what do you know about it.

165
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,227
I know how I can use these
tools to fit together

166
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,397
to gather that information and
put it into the right place.

167
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,632
We'll talk about that
process in just a second.

168
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,605
The ultimate key to tools is
fitting into your environment.

169
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,407
To go back to the ramen analogy,

170
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,808
I can have the best
chef's knife ever

171
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,246
and I can buy three of the
best chef's knives ever.

172
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,347
Does that help me
if I need to reach

173
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,216
into a boiling hot pot of water?

174
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,385
It's about how those
tools fit together.

175
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,955
It's about being able to use
them to accomplish a goal

176
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,756
and understanding
what that goal is.

177
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,426
I like quotes.

178
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,994
I like quotes from smart
people and in this case,

179
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,830
I was able to find a bunch
of quotes from chefs and

180
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,167
so Daniel Boulud, famous said,

181
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,573
I have been in too
many environments

182
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,974
where people have
blamed their tools

183
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,577
for not being able to
accomplish their goal.

184
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,078
I have also been in environments

185
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:34,981
where someone with just a
python prompt has been able

186
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,883
to do everything
that all those tools

187
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,217
I just showed you could do.

188
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,354
You have the ability,
it's all understanding

189
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,156
about how it fits in
with your environment.

190
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,526
Also fun story
about Daniel Boulud.

191
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,395
I was listening to
him on a podcast and

192
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,064
he asked about his favorite
like guilty pleasure food,

193
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,299
walking taco.

194
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,435
Really?

195
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,204
Come on walking taco for a
three-Michelin-starred chef,

196
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,204
that's crazy.

197
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,541
Oh okay, fine.

198
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,544
I guess a big fan of the
walking taco, alright.

199
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,080
Going along with this idea,

200
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,983
the ingredients that you're
gonna use for your dish,

201
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,919
whether that's intel or ramen.

202
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,956
The definition of an ingredient,

203
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,891
again one of those
weirdly abstract things

204
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,358
where we all kind of
know what it is but

205
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,895
do you know how to describe it?

206
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,829
It's simply,

207
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,170
That's again one of those
weirdly abstract ideas

208
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,274
that's just so kind of it's a
thing that goes into a thing

209
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,410
and makes a new thing.

210
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,877
Okay, pretty simple.

211
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,417
For ramen, like my
photography work back there,

212
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,785
we have a couple
different things.

213
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,520
We have some apples,
we have some garlic,

214
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,456
we have some diced
ginger, a bunch of onion

215
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,458
because onion is delicious.

216
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,463
In this case, it is what is
a vaguely shoyu style ramen,

217
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,699
which means it's
soy sauce based,

218
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,233
so we've got a
bunch of soy sauce.

219
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,935
I'm sorry for anyone
who wanted to make this

220
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,871
and is a little bit
on the vegetarian side

221
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,007
because it does involve a
half rack of baby back ribs.

222
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,947
It's also ramen, so
you're gonna need noodles.

223
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,916
I recommend you can
just buy them online.

224
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,819
They're super great, easy
to find, they keep forever.

225
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,121
Thank you Momofuku Ando.

226
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,992
Then there's a couple
different extras

227
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,526
that I like putting in mine.

228
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,262
I like using kombu,
which is a dried seaweed.

229
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:35,167
I like using dried shiitake
mushrooms, sweet potato,

230
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,270
if you're a sweet
potato fan, fantastic.

231
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,040
I also like using green
onions for a lot for things

232
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,675
so just chuck the ends in there.

233
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,843
Turns out you're making a soup,

234
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,111
just throw everything
in together.

235
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:45,911
It's great.

236
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,615
There's some extras that
you can generally add

237
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,251
as you're putting your
soup together at the end.

238
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,786
We'll talk about that
process in a second.

239
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,856
I really like slow poached eggs.

240
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,992
It's like just kind of gooey
and falls apart in the soup.

241
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,526
It's great.

242
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,797
Sriracha, more of
that sweet potato.

243
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,600
I like the sweet potato so
much, I put it on here twice.

244
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,703
Alright.

245
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,506
What about for
threat intelligence?

246
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,641
Are you thinking, okay.

247
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,510
I know I'm stretching
an analogy here.

248
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,078
But are you thinking
about it a little bit?

249
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,047
Are you thinking about
what you're ingredients are

250
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,314
for threat intelligence?

251
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,216
What are the things that
you're putting together

252
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:29,088
to get to an end goal.

253
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,623
I'll tell you some
of my favorites.

254
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,959
My own incidents.

255
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,295
I mentioned this a
little bit with a tip but

256
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,365
the number of companies that
seem unable to remember things

257
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:44,136
that happened to them six
months ago is crazy to me.

258
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,740
If you're not starting your
blacklist from IP addresses

259
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,176
from the last incident
you dealt with,

260
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,212
you're hamstringing yourself.

261
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,383
So take your own incidents,
enrich them, understand them

262
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,319
and use that as part of your
own detection and use that

263
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,921
as part of your continued
enrichment moving forward.

264
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,292
Your own teams.

265
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,929
I used to work at Symantec and
I was part of what we called

266
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,598
global threat operations before
there even was a CTI thing

267
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,402
and one of the very best
sets of information I got

268
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,871
is twice a day, cause we
were of a shift schedule

269
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,740
so once for each shift,

270
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,908
I'd go downstairs and
talk to the analysts

271
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,711
who were the ones actually
looking at individual attacks

272
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,482
as they were going on and
saying, what's been interesting?

273
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,415
What's useful today?

274
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,284
What's surprised you?

275
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,053
And the number of times
someone would say,

276
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,889
hey we saw this weird thing,
I didn't have enough time

277
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,858
to look into it,
that ended up leading

278
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,993
to something really
useful was shocking to me.

279
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:45,231
So especially as a CTI
analyst, take the time

280
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,866
to get to know the teams who are

281
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:51,670
in the thick of it,
in the weeds, dealing
with it day to day

282
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,772
and listen and follow
up on the things

283
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,573
that they share with you.

284
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,780
(sighs) Vendor reports, I
have love, hate relationship

285
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,747
but taking the time to
at least exploit these,

286
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,017
understand what's there,
save the information

287
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,887
is definitely a
worth while process.

288
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,324
(sighs) I'm actually
surprised, we haven't had

289
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:18,097
a whole lot of honeypot
discussion this CTI Summit.

290
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,733
It was kind of the big
thing for a little bit.

291
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,867
But honeypots are
really interesting and

292
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,471
honeypots can provide
a really high signal

293
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,642
that can go into
your CTI program

294
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,411
provided you understand what
those honeypots are sharing,

295
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,714
where the information they're
giving you provides value.

296
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,551
Throwing a random server
on the internet and

297
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,886
saying who tries to
SSH us into this,

298
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,355
I don't see a whole
lot of value with that.

299
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,759
Having an extra database
running in my environment

300
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,928
that shouldn't have
any connections to it

301
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,363
and monitoring if anybody
tries to connect to it,

302
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,998
that's kind of useful.

303
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,805
Probably my single
favorite thing though,

304
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,406
aside from my own incidents,

305
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,409
is peer and sharing communities.

306
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,612
One of the things I
love about this event

307
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,348
and if you're not taking
advantage of it, I urge you to

308
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,786
is finding people who have
similar needs, similar problems,

309
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,689
similar companies,
building relationships

310
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,656
and sharing
information with them.

311
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,093
I get so much good intelligence

312
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,627
from people that
I've gotten to know

313
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:27,066
through events like this
that face similar problems

314
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,601
that I do.

315
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,404
The outside perspective, I was
talking earlier with Rob Lee.

316
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,741
Hi Rob, give me a
wave, there we go.

317
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,311
About the idea of
building threat campaigns

318
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,714
based not on a single
perspective but

319
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,284
based on multiple perspectives
with partner organizations.

320
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,354
This is a must do and if
you're sitting there going

321
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,522
I don't have a good group
of people to reach out

322
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,625
to about incidences
that I'm seeing,

323
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,127
start building those
relationships today.

324
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,896
Turns out I think we're
going to get beer after this

325
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,997
and that's probably a
good place to start.

326
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,300
Um yeah,

327
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,535
That's also a thing.

328
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,304
I think I'm legally
required to say that.

329
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,007
So okay, Jamie Oliver,

330
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,742
somebody who loves
good fresh ingredients.

331
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,683
I could say the same thing
to you about intelligence.

332
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,385
Good threat intelligence
is only gonna be

333
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,655
as good as the ingredients
you're able to put in.

334
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,424
So understanding where
you'll pulling data from,

335
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,959
how much do you trust
it, what can you use it

336
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,697
for is key to being
successful and

337
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,532
building great threat
intel products.

338
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,168
Also, just those dreamy eyes.

339
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,374
At some point, you
have all this stuff

340
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,776
you've pulled together.

341
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,044
You've got tools to
manipulate your ingredients,

342
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,712
you've got ingredients
that are gonna be

343
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,113
part of the final dish.

344
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,448
How do you put it all together?

345
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,016
What's the process
component looks like?

346
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,421
Again another one of
those very abstract ideas.

347
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm pretty sure all three of
those definitions only had

348
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,662
like 10 words between them and

349
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,664
it was something in
every one of them.

350
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,903
So for ramen, what's the recipe?

351
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,371
It's really simple.

352
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,007
This is a pretty straight
forward ramen recipe actually.

353
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,143
Bring water to a simmer.

354
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,848
I like adding some
dried mushrooms, a
piece of kombu or nori

355
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,983
some dried seaweed,
just gives it

356
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,219
a nice richness towards the end.

357
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,556
Add all the other ingredients,
except the noodles

358
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,358
cause if you leave those
in there for three hours,

359
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,193
they'll just kind
of disintegrate.

360
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,030
Reduce from heat and simmer
for about two and a half

361
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,531
to three hours.

362
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,733
Here's what I will tell
you, the longer the better

363
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,202
cause it just keeps getting down

364
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,772
to this like concentrated
broth, it's fantastic.

365
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,474
And then in the end,
prepare the noodles and

366
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,343
serve with whatever extras
are interesting to you.

367
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,544
Pretty straight forward.

368
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,784
I will say though, recipe
for threat intelligence is

369
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,586
not usually quite
as straight forward.

370
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,323
It turns out the tools
are relatively simple.

371
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,459
The ingredients,
we all kind of have

372
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,328
a similar group of ingredients.

373
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,330
The process is gonna be
very, very different.

374
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,233
You've got to develop what works
best for your organization,

375
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,801
what works best
for your team and

376
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:20,671
that's gonna be a lot different
if you've got 20 versus

377
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,207
you have two.

378
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,777
Whether you're
dedicated to CTI or

379
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,513
whether it's just one of
many, many thing you do.

380
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,951
I'm actually surprised, I
think we've only seen the

381
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,453
intelligence cycle once today.

382
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,323
A good mindset to keep.

383
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,560
My preferred recipe though
for my threat intelligence

384
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,495
is usually based on this model

385
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,697
The F3EAD model.

386
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,604
So over here, we have our
incident response piece.

387
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,939
What are we gonna look for?

388
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,508
Once we've decided, how
do we go look for it?

389
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,243
Then you respond to it,

390
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,146
whether that's removing the
adversary from the environment,

391
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,681
what have you.

392
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,883
Then on the other side, we
take all this information

393
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,120
that we learned during the
incident response piece

394
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,688
and build our intel based on it.

395
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,226
So exploit is taking that
final incident response report

396
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,861
and going, what
pieces are useful

397
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,097
for my threat
intelligence group?

398
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,199
Analyze is figuring
out how that leads

399
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:24,703
to a better final product,
whether it's a target package

400
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,973
about the adversary, whether
it's new set indicators,

401
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,975
whether it's something you want
to share with somebody else.

402
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,377
And then lastly is this
disseminate piece and

403
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,013
that may be as simple as
sending a report back to your

404
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:40,018
CND team, it might be working
with industry partners

405
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,654
or those sharing
groups I mentioned.

406
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,857
You've got to figure out how
this works in your environment

407
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,425
but this provides
a really useful and

408
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,927
interesting paradigm to work in.

409
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,667
Lastly from a
process perspective,

410
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,003
I see so many teams
who struggle because

411
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,372
they don't take the time to
learn from their own activities,

412
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,009
to learn from their own actions.

413
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,378
I spend almost as much time
during an incident writing

414
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,047
the things down that
are going poorly because

415
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,218
I want to have those things
for my next set of operations.

416
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,254
Whether that, hey this
would have been a lot easier

417
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,357
if we would have had this
particular type of log or

418
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,425
it was really hard
because I didn't know

419
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,861
how to transfer information
between me and John.

420
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,364
Having those lessons and

421
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,566
knowing how you can improve
yourself moving forward

422
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,969
means you stop making the
same mistakes multiple times.

423
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,507
Lidia Bastianich, this
quote was amazing and

424
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,310
I like how it doesn't
even mention cooking or

425
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,146
anything like that and I think
it's incredibly important

426
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,114
for what we do.

427
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,520
I love the talk that
Ryan and Dave gave,

428
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,522
taking the work that
Mark Parsons had done and

429
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:55,194
expanding upon it and I think
that speaks to this perfectly.

430
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,728
That it's becoming a thing

431
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,765
that we expect folks
to be able to do.

432
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,738
Last piece for this is
the cooks and again,

433
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,641
I'm stretching the analogy by
the cooks I mean the people.

434
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,444
Who are your people who
are doing these analyses

435
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,012
in your environment and I think

436
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,114
there's three really key
things that you can look at

437
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,751
about great technicians
whether they're cooks

438
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,353
or cyber threat analysts.

439
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,289
They consume.

440
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:30,028
If you watch the documentary
"Jiro Dreams of Sushi"

441
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,530
he talks about how
important it is

442
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,234
he takes all his cooks
to really good meals.

443
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,937
You never think of this in
most American restaurants.

444
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,406
No one's taking
everybody at pizza hut

445
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,575
to a really good
Italian pizza place

446
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,978
so they understand what
better pizza's like

447
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,917
but at Jiro's they go to
the other great sushi places

448
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,020
in Tokyo, they go
eat good ramen.

449
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,456
He wants his cooks to understand

450
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,890
what great food tastes like,

451
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,361
what good technique looks like.

452
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,198
They grow by taking in what
other people are doing.

453
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,799
We can do the same thing.

454
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:13,071
I don't work in ICS environments
or banking environments

455
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,240
but I read reports
on both of them.

456
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,843
Simply because I get to see
what good reports look like,

457
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,545
I get to see what good
analysis looks like,

458
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,948
I get to learn what
works and what doesn't.

459
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,618
By the way, PDF's that
are just images and

460
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,888
I can't copy and paste from
it, that doesn't work, stop it.

461
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,889
(sighs)

462
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,796
The next piece though it
great cooks cook, make things.

463
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,865
People ask me a lot,
how do I get better at

464
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,535
cyber threat intelligence
or malware analysis

465
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,037
or memory analysis?

466
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,807
Do it, built it.

467
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,277
You want to learn how to make
a better threat intel product?

468
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,413
Build one and let
someone you think knows

469
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,783
what good intel products
looks like tear it apart.

470
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:02,687
It is an ego blasting thing
but it will make you better.

471
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,757
We see this a lot again
with the great cooks.

472
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:10,495
An important thing you'll see
is a thing called a stage,

473
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,098
which is when an up
and coming chef goes

474
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,068
and starts working in
other people's kitchens and

475
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:20,439
sometimes they're paid like
minimum wage but even still

476
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,207
most of the chef's
that were on stages

477
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,210
will go to multi
hundred dollar dinners

478
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,314
and it's not some kind of luxury
to have a really nice meal

479
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,517
it's because going and
eating the food somebody else

480
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,020
makes a huge difference.

481
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,489
The same thing
with creating food.

482
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,961
And both of those feed
the idea that great chefs

483
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,663
are always trying to learn.

484
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,732
It should be the
same thing for us.

485
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,668
The second I hear anybody
in CTI, incident response

486
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,704
any of these things tell
me, I think I've got it.

487
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,873
I know you don't got it.

488
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,442
I know you don't
know what's going on.

489
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,146
We are blessed and cursed with

490
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,848
an interesting set of problems

491
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,384
where there is an intelligent
adversary on the other side

492
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,586
who is trying to
be where we're not,

493
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,422
who is trying to do the
thing we haven't thought of

494
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,791
and that means if we
don't continue learning,

495
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,560
we can't keep getting better
because I will tell you

496
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,031
the adversaries are learning
and we teach them every time

497
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,068
we respond to them, we
need to do the same thing.

498
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,003
There's a great Yiddish proverb,

499
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,239
listen to your enemies
for God is speaking.

500
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,208
That means lot for us.

501
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:36,548
Gaggan Andna, Anand, I knew
I was gonna trip over this

502
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,251
has a great quote about this.

503
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,728
That's another tough one
for this and by the way

504
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,063
really ironic for the
guy on stage to be saying

505
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,802
but be humble, keep
working, be hungry.

506
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,006
So finally, those pieces
all come together and

507
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,507
what do we get?

508
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,479
Well, that's my ramen,
that's what I make.

509
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,014
Anybody hungry?

510
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,415
Yeah okay, thank you.

511
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,818
It's pretty good,
it's really good.

512
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,320
What about for intelligence
products though?

513
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,489
What is the output we
can build look like?

514
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,660
Michael had a great
talk earlier about RFIS

515
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,496
and about building requirements.

516
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,265
I think of these as
kind of the amuse-bouche

517
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,202
of the intel world,
a quick little

518
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,971
does this meet the
need kind of thing,

519
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,906
a request for intelligence.

520
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,809
On the other side we
have short form products,

521
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,312
things that get done
in a particular case.

522
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,815
They tend to be a one
or two page thing.

523
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,250
They're answering
a specific problem

524
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,285
in a little bit of depth.

525
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,022
Generally speaking from my
perspective, most intel teams

526
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,658
are gonna spend a lot
of their time on these

527
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,061
and then finally we
have the big products.

528
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,829
The stuff that
takes a long time,

529
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,130
that you have to build
a team to work on.

530
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:04,336
That takes effort and new
collection requirements and

531
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,670
multiple processes.

532
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,440
That reminds me a lot of
a thanksgiving dinner.

533
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,575
Where you're taking the time
to bring a lot of ingredients,

534
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,778
a lot of tools with
a big ultimate goal.

535
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:20,318
So in the end, think
about your tools.

536
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,457
Understand your ingredients
and know what they mean

537
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,626
and how you can use
them most effectively.

538
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,830
Much like cooking,
confusing inputs

539
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,399
can make a huge difference.

540
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,235
Has anyone ever used mints
when they meant to use basil?

541
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,272
Okay.

542
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,908
Your spaghetti sauce is
not great after that,

543
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,074
I'm just saying.

544
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,277
(laughs)

545
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,013
Knowing your inputs
is important.

546
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,514
Keep building and
growing your processes.

547
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,083
Get better at the
ones you have and

548
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,852
once you're good
at the processes,

549
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,655
try to improve the
processes themselves.

550
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,956
And then finally and I
think most importantly

551
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:02,994
spend the time, grow your
people, grow yourself,

552
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,696
get better at this thing.

553
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,698
Again, the second we start
thinking we've got it,

554
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,402
we have a handle on it,
we're falling behind.

555
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,806
So with that, here is my recipe.

556
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,576
I'm gonna put this up
here for about 10 seconds

557
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,344
in case you want
to take a picture.

558
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,846
It's delicious.

559
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,083
This is actually
based the ramen recipe

560
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,753
from a D.C. chef,
Erik Bruner Yang.

561
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,121
He opened a restaurant
called Toki Underground.

562
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,659
It is his one pot ramen.

563
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,231
Okay, thank you very much.

564
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,835
(audience applause)

565
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,404
(upbeat music)
