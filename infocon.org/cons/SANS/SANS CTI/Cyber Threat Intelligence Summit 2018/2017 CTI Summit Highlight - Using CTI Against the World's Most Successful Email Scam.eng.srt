1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,699
because of everything that we do as

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,839
threat Intel sometimes here who feels

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,450
like giving information to law

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,889
enforcement to one-way road sometimes

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,250
you do right guess what I promise you

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,719
it's not in August of 2015 Kolb assume

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,550
you got arrested for cases that we

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,530
investigated and accidentally proved him

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,690
as the author of these just so happened

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,150
to be in Dallas which was really cool it

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,490
was a nice city that happened there but

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,439
the takeaway from this is all this work

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,090
we do all this research that we do and

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,230
everything go into sometimes you don't

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,690
see they'll the Silver Line at the end

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,070
but it's there I promise you keep doing

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,839
the good work keep doing the research

18
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,990
keep finding these attackers we'll catch

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,990
them
