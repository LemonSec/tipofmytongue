1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,180
over time what we ended up doing was

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,620
looking at what nation-states were

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,588
breaking into control system

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,870
environments the whole idea there is

5
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:14,639
maybe there's threats and teams that we

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,998
just haven't seen before the traditional

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,679
way

8
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:18,240
so you think of normal government

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,470
networks normal sort of government view

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,640
they might see China and Russia a lot

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,140
but that's because they're breaking into

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,250
the defense industrial base that's

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,439
because they're breaking into networks

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,259
to steal off data but maybe we don't see

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,259
the Algerian apt team very often
