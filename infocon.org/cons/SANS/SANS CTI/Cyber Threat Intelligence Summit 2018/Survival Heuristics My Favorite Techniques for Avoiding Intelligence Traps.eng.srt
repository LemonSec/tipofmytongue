1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,103
(light music)

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,145
(applause)

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm here to talk to you about
some of the lessons I learned

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,384
at CIA over my
32-year career there

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:23,390
that saved my butt from really
some embarrassing mistakes,

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,593
although, I nevertheless
made embarrassing mistakes

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,063
while I was at CIA and
I've entitled my talk,

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,464
Survival Heuristics.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,801
So, just a little about
a (mumbles) thing here.

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:39,039
I did work at the CIA,
I spent 32 years there

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,208
as an analyst and as
a manager of analysts,

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,445
and here I am in only one
of two possible countries,

13
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,380
which one is it?

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,949
Afghanistan, I heard
the F somewhere,

15
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,552
and these two guys here are...

16
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,390
Protecting me and I
carefully cropped the photo

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,026
select you can't figure
out the plane number,

18
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,761
and I spent 32 years there.

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,665
I worked on Southern
Africa and the Middle East

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,568
and then I eventually
became a Poo Bah

21
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,904
and hardly had to work at all.

22
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,743
As I went through my career,

23
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,012
I became less and
less interested

24
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,648
in any particular
part of the world,

25
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,149
and much more interested
in how we think.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,920
How do we generate good ideas?

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,590
How do we examine an
issue comprehensively?

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,460
And so, I became really
interested in that

29
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,863
and as a result, I sort of
became a heretic at the CIA.

30
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,766
I was thinking too much, right?

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,168
And I was always
suggesting different things

32
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,537
that we could do, different
approaches that we could take.

33
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:49,008
In fact, when the
internet reared its
head in the mid 1990s,

34
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,911
I was the person at
the CIA who was saying,

35
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,616
"You know, the internet is
gonna be big, it's gonna change

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,853
"the way all knowledge
organizations do their work."

37
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,321
In fact, it actually
changed the way

38
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,090
all organizations do their work.

39
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,494
And at the time when I was
arguing that in the mid 1990s,

40
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,764
people were not very
receptive that it at the CIA.

41
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,801
I didn't realize,
and this is something

42
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,036
that I get into a little bit
in my book, Rebels At Work,

43
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,407
which is co-written
actually with Lois Kelly,

44
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,810
is that when you're
trying to make change

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,748
in an organization, and
this may have some relevance

46
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:32,852
to being a cyber security
officer in a large organization,

47
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,955
when you're trying to affect
change in an organization,

48
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,224
it's very difficult to do it

49
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:42,227
if what you are presenting
is a theological argument.

50
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:47,233
So, the internet is all about
opened information, right?

51
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,505
At least it was in the 1990s,
and the CIA is all about...

52
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:57,210
Right, closed information
and arguing the benefits

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,479
of something that
would promote openness

54
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,980
and sharing an information

55
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,382
to an organization
that was so closed,

56
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,652
I might as well have
been like Martin Luther,

57
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,922
banging up the letters on the
church in Wittenberg, right?

58
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,391
That's how receptive they were.

59
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,091
So, some of the
lessons about that

60
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,196
are captured in the
book, Rebels At Work.

61
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,666
Which some of you, some
unlucky people I guess

62
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,434
are going to get today.

63
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,370
But the rest of my talk that
I really wanna talk about

64
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,740
are the lessons I learned
about good thinking

65
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,445
and avoiding the traps
that lead to bad thinking.

66
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,846
So, are you good with that?

67
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:34,714
(hooting)
Yeah?

68
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,183
Alright, let's go, so...

69
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,720
I'm just gonna go through
a few of the traps.

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,089
Avoid the Streetlight Effect.

71
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,758
Raise your hand if
you have some idea

72
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,127
of what I mean by the
Streetlight Effect.

73
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,463
There's a few,
okay, but not many.

74
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,601
So, there's a joke, and the
politically incorrect version

75
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,036
of the joke is that
there's a drunk

76
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,740
at night on a sidewalk
on his hands and knees.

77
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,576
And the person doesn't
have to be drunk, right?

78
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,311
It's just something
they threw in the story.

79
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:10,683
And a policeman finds
him and says, or her,

80
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,951
"What are you doing?"

81
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,721
And the drunk says,
"I lost my car keys,

82
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,656
"I'm looking for my car keys."

83
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,993
And the policeman says, "Is
this where you lost 'em?"

84
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:24,097
The drunk says, "No, but it's
the only place I can see."

85
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,866
So, that's the
Streetlight Effect

86
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:31,270
where we as analysts
treat the information

87
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,173
that is in front of
us, the streetlight,

88
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:39,112
and act as if it accurately
represents reality.

89
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,414
And I have to say and
I'm ashamed to admit it

90
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,116
that I was well
into my CIA career,

91
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,786
probably 20 years
into my CIA career,

92
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,454
which gives you an idea

93
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:53,026
of how effective their
internal brainwashing is

94
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,763
and/or how not
introspective they are,

95
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,830
that I said, "Wait a minute,

96
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,768
"this information that
reaches me through my inbox,

97
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,604
"I don't actually know

98
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,440
"how accurately it
represents reality."

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,445
Actually, I don't know what
share of reality it represents.

100
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,147
Is it 5%, is it 20%?

101
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,216
I mean, if you think
about it yourself

102
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,885
as cyber threat analysts,

103
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,188
if you were God and
you were on omniscient,

104
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,726
and you knew everything
there is possible

105
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,895
to know about cyber threat,

106
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,964
now compare that
to what you know.

107
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,167
What percentage of everything

108
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,936
that you should
know do you know?

109
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,573
But yet, you're forced to
make decisions on that,

110
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,808
you know, you have no choice

111
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,210
but to make decisions
on what you do know.

112
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,647
But the only point here that
I wanna make is be humble

113
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,149
about those decisions
that you're making.

114
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,251
Avoid the Streetlight Effect.

115
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,387
Always realize that
the information

116
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,590
you have in front of
you represents a slice,

117
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,393
and a kind of a flawed slice
'cause it's biased too,

118
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,796
and I won't get into that
for the sake of time,

119
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,632
just represents a
slice of reality.

120
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,302
So one, avoid the
Streetlight Effect.

121
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:13,806
Trends are always, is
always about the past.

122
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:20,746
I hate it when people presented
an argument about the future

123
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,716
based on trends of the past.

124
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,587
Trends are composed of data
points and so by definition,

125
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,090
if it's a date point, it
has to be about the past.

126
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,426
So, anyone know what this
trend line represents actually?

127
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,264
It's a very famous trendline
in American history.

128
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,700
It's the trendline of
the Great Depression.

129
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,673
So, the first severe
drop is October 1929

130
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,878
when the stock market crashed.

131
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,680
Notice that it began
to go up after that

132
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,015
and a lot of people thought,

133
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,618
"Oh, it's over,
everything's gonna be fine."

134
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,753
And then it just
steadily plummeted down

135
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,822
until I think the last point is

136
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,459
maybe 1936, 1937 on that line.

137
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,528
So, at any point
on that trend line,

138
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,896
if you had based your decision

139
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,931
on what had happened previously,

140
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,368
you were likely to
make a flawed decision.

141
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,104
So, what do I like to
use instead of trends?

142
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,572
Well, I'm a fan...

143
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,974
Okay, so first you have
to use trends, right?

144
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,075
You have to know what
the past tells you.

145
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,345
But if you know anything
about probability,

146
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,782
what happened a moment
ago doesn't really affect

147
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,317
what's gonna happen next.

148
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,754
It's a false construction
that we have in our heads.

149
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,889
And what I like to look at a lot

150
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,193
are small indicators of change.

151
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,195
I think the best way
to observe the future

152
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,032
is to observe the present
very, very carefully.

153
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,301
So, when I travel, for example,

154
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,736
I pay a lot of
attention to graffiti.

155
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,673
Graffiti is one of my
favorite social indicators.

156
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:57,477
Just the volume of graffiti
in a particular city

157
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,712
like Madrid, for
example in Spain,

158
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,781
tells you something
about the social cohesion

159
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,316
of that country.

160
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,185
And from what I know about
cyber threat intelligence,

161
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,888
perhaps this is the
point for me to confess

162
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,056
that I don't know
a lot about cyber,

163
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,726
I didn't work on it
in my agency career,

164
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,561
but from what I understand

165
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,097
of the way these
malicious groups work,

166
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,500
they do have a kind of graffiti

167
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,836
that exists, that
they leave behind

168
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,940
as they troll companies and
as they talk to each other

169
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,243
about what they wanna do next.

170
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,410
So, I like small indicators,

171
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,482
I describe myself as an
analyst of small things.

172
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,385
And kind of related, but a
somewhat expanded category

173
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:44,122
are non-obvious indicators
of whatever phenomenon

174
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,225
that you're trying to look at.

175
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:52,098
What can you see that is
not a direct indicator,

176
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,468
but somehow travels
with the phenomenon

177
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,002
that you're trying to look at?

178
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,973
But my bottom line is
don't depend on trends.

179
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,710
Related, most things
don't happen by chance.

180
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,946
Now you know what?

181
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,348
I've said this before
at other conferences

182
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,016
and I've bee
appropriately challenged

183
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,352
by someone who points out
that you do have things

184
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,788
like random clustering, correct.

185
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,560
How I really came
upon this rule,

186
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,700
or thinking trap to avoid,

187
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,135
is an analyst actually,

188
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,738
when I was reviewing
his or her paper,

189
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,275
actually wrote that
X event in a country

190
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,144
had happened by chance.

191
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,280
And I pulled the
analyst in and I said,

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,982
"Well, what do you
mean by the fact

193
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,550
"that this thing
happened by chance?"

194
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,988
And the analyst was you
know, hemming and hawing

195
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:52,291
and I realized that
when we use the phrase,

196
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,226
something happened
happened by chance,

197
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,329
what we're actually saying is

198
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,665
that we do not understand
the causality chain

199
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,101
that lead to this event, right?

200
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,503
So, when you say something
happens by chance,

201
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,673
you're saying, "Well, there's
no way I coulda known,

202
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,075
"therefore I'm not
responsible to try

203
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,277
"to figure out
how I could know."

204
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,945
If you replace that phrase with,

205
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,515
"I do not yet understand
the causality chain,"

206
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,552
then in fact, you are
much more likely to work

207
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,754
on trying to figure
out why things

208
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,656
that you didn't think
were gonna happen,

209
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,992
or that completely surprised
you, in fact did happen.

210
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:31,998
So related to most things not
happening by chance is this,

211
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,934
which is exponential causality.

212
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,036
Now, I've scoured the
internet looking for an image

213
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,173
that could represent
exponential causality.

214
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,109
At this point,
the Grand Taxonomy

215
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,645
of RAP Names is what
I've settled on.

216
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,381
If you Google that
and look it up,

217
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:53,352
you'll see that one rapper
comes up with a name

218
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,388
and all of a sudden,

219
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,323
that influences a whole
lot of other rappers,

220
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,992
and then lead to a whole
lot of other rappers

221
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,363
and this great universe
of usual names emerges.

222
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,966
Now, exponential
causality is related

223
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,569
to the notion of exponential
functions, of course,

224
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,271
and how many of you have read,

225
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,439
Thinking Fast and Slow
by Daniel Kahneman?

226
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,009
Required reading, I think,

227
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,912
for a serious
intelligence analyst.

228
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,083
He makes the point
that one of the reasons

229
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,019
why humans are so bad
at statistics, me,

230
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,754
is because we're not very good

231
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,424
at understanding
exponential functions.

232
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,526
But related to
exponential functions,

233
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:38,097
how something can go from
like three to 15 in one step,

234
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,266
is what I call
exponential causality.

235
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,437
So, we tend to think
linearly, unfortunately.

236
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,307
It's something that our
education encourages us to do

237
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,844
and the way we look at
facts encourages us to do,

238
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,779
but we tend to
think A leads to B,

239
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,515
B leads to C, so
forth and so on.

240
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,653
But in reality, A leads to a
multiple set of consequences

241
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,022
and each of those leads

242
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,591
to another multiple
set of consequences,

243
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,394
and if you keep up
on quantum theory,

244
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,096
it's even argued that something

245
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,198
in the future can
affect the past

246
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,501
and affect the consequences
of the thing in the past.

247
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,238
So, you're dealing with
exponential causality

248
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,107
and you have to respect that.

249
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,944
And trend lines, actually,

250
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:29,647
are a great example of
something that we use a lot

251
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,752
that doesn't take into
account exponential causality.

252
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,786
Are y'all still with me?

253
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,621
Yeah?

254
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,454
Okay.

255
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,959
Worst case scenarios happen.

256
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,597
Now, I love this gif, I will
play it over and over again.

257
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,432
Hopefully it'll
just, there it goes.

258
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,368
My favorite thing
about this gif, or gif,

259
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,504
there's a controversy as
to what you should say,

260
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,205
if you look at it again,

261
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,541
is the car approaching
the intersection.

262
00:12:55,541 --> 00:13:00,279
The driver, I love to imagine
the driver in that car going,

263
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,215
"Large red ball has
appeared in front of me."

264
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,084
You know, something he
had never prepared for.

265
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,587
This is apparently a
Toledo art installation

266
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,122
or something like
that gone wrong

267
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,857
and the large
rubber ball escaped.

268
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,029
I don't think I can
stop it unless I advance

269
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,266
to the next slide, so we'll
just leave it like that.

270
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,569
Anyway so, I learned this lesson

271
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,440
as a result of a conversation
I had with a policy maker.

272
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,312
And bad stuff had begun
to happen in the country,

273
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,483
you might even imagine that
country as Iraq, for example.

274
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,185
And there's a meeting
with the policy maker

275
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,989
and policy maker goes, "You
didn't warn me about this."

276
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,560
And we say, "Well, we did, we
told you this could happen."

277
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,494
And the policy maker says,

278
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,997
"But you said that
was a worst case."

279
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,770
Interesting, so what was
the policy maker doing?

280
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,174
What was he assuming we meant
when we said worst case?

281
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,680
Unlikely, so police
makers often conflate

282
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,649
the worst case scenario
that you've painted

283
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,954
and think to themselves,
"Oh, that must be unlikely."

284
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,388
So, one of the most
important pieces of advice

285
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,658
that I have to give you all,

286
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,560
particularly those
of you who deal

287
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,595
with decision makers
in your company,

288
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,865
and who have to convince
them of the importance

289
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,301
of a security threat
of one kind of another,

290
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,339
that just because you say
something is worst case

291
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,275
doesn't mean that it's
unlikely and in fact,

292
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:41,213
the probability of something
occurring is independent

293
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,317
from the consequences that
that event may have, right?

294
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:50,289
And it's human nature, you
have to really fight this hard

295
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,793
to equate worst case scenario
thinking with unlikely.

296
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:59,798
Completely different and can
cause all sorts of disconnects

297
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,569
and communication issues
with your customers.

298
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,973
Finally, we get to
move on from that.

299
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,911
Again, this is also about
dealing with your customers.

300
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,781
When you're explaining,
you're losing.

301
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,349
I think it was Ronald
Reagan, when I Googled this,

302
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,921
Ronald Reagan comes up as
the originator of this quote.

303
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,757
"If you're explaining,
you're losing."

304
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,327
But when we as technical
experts present

305
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,562
whatever our findings are,

306
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:34,800
we tend to present them
with a lot of facts

307
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,637
and lot of information,

308
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,641
and we're doing that
to a policy maker

309
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,543
who wants simply
to make a decision

310
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,646
and the very act of explaining,

311
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,317
the more you go on,
the more your drone on,

312
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,287
I think the more you're
losing, as a general rule,

313
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,123
the person that you're
trying to persuade.

314
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,394
This is particularly true
when an argument ensues.

315
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,331
You say X and the
policy maker says,

316
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,034
"No, I don't believe
X, Y is true."

317
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:14,039
And then you start to explain
why the policy maker is wrong.

318
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,809
And you ain't getting
anywhere there.

319
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,012
So my advice to you, and we're
gonna talk a little bit more

320
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,381
about best practices
in a little while.

321
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,751
But my advice to you when
you're talking to a policy maker

322
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:30,756
is that you need to have
compelling stories and examples

323
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,760
to make the point
that you want to make

324
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,396
and have those ready to go

325
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:41,165
rather than another
technical explanation.

326
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,868
I don't know what the analogs

327
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,504
and metaphors are
in your domain,

328
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,107
but you need to
have those available

329
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,809
so that you can present them

330
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:55,047
rather than only rely
upon explanation.

331
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,016
So for example,

332
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:02,021
a policy maker might say,
"Well, do you have any evidence

333
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,521
"that this could happen?"

334
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,458
And you might not have any
evidence, any hard evidence.

335
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,527
And you could say, "No,
I don't but you know,

336
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,030
"we wanna avoid being
like the drunk looking

337
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,699
"for his car keys only
in the streetlight."

338
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,969
Something that really
makes the point

339
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,605
without having to deal with
a lot of technicalities.

340
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,511
And finally, I think this is
the final one of my traps is

341
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,479
you never run out of bullets.

342
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,215
This is again, I
guess another way

343
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,850
to come out linear thinking.

344
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,686
When I was, and I
think this might

345
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,621
really apply to your domain.

346
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,124
One of the lessons
I learned early on

347
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,093
from one of my
first team chiefs,

348
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,495
he had been working
on Laos, I think,

349
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,799
and he told me, "Carmen,
I had it figured out.

350
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,535
"I had counted the
number of bullets

351
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,570
"the Laotian guerrillas have,

352
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,439
"and I knew that on April 13th,

353
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,041
"they were gonna
run out of bullets.

354
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,910
"They weren't gonna have
any more bullets to fire."

355
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,679
And my boss at the
time said to me,

356
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,148
"John, you never
run out of bullets."

357
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,251
i.e. life happens,
stuff happens,

358
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,921
and they find a
way to keep going.

359
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,424
So, when you think about what
you're working on analytically

360
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,761
and you've got it, like the
whole linear train figured out

361
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,597
and you know that on this day,

362
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,799
the attack is gonna
end or on that day,

363
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,434
the attack is gonna start,

364
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,671
step back, swallow a
little bit of humility,

365
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,340
and realize that you
never run out of bullets.

366
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,908
Still with me?

367
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,011
Alright, I just like
to check, you know?

368
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:37,014
Alright, oh, one more,
speaking of bullets.

369
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,119
I ruined my segue,
emotions can kill.

370
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
Has anybody here ever
worked at CIA, actually?

371
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,427
I should have asked
this question earlier.

372
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,395
Ah, I see a couple
of hands, yep.

373
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,531
So, one of the things
that we did as analysts

374
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,667
is we tried to be
extremely objective

375
00:18:55,667 --> 00:19:00,238
and we didn't wanna have any
kind of subjective issues

376
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,709
injected in our analysis.

377
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,378
And again, as I went
further into my career,

378
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,514
I realized that
that was mistaken

379
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,149
because the world
is made of humans

380
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,054
and humans are of
course highly emotional.

381
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,092
And we often would
misjudge a situation

382
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,694
or the severity of an outcome,

383
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,963
or what happened in
Iraq, for example,

384
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,966
or what's happening
today in Afghanistan,

385
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:32,236
because we underestimated
the emotional motivation

386
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,207
that the actors had
in the conflict.

387
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,610
I was thinking how this might
apply to what you all do

388
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,348
and I understand that a lot
of what happens in terms of...

389
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,188
Successful attacks on a
system involve getting a human

390
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,822
to click on a
piece of click bait

391
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,359
that brings the virus or
the malware into the system.

392
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,197
And you can say to the
human over and over again,

393
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,498
"Don't click on attachments."

394
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:05,270
But you know, if they
love kitten pictures

395
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,675
and they are having
a really bad day,

396
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,944
the chances are heightened
that they are gonna click

397
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,912
on that thing that
appeals to us.

398
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,348
And of course, there's
this entire field of,

399
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:21,353
see if I get it
right, social cyber...

400
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:26,358
Social cyber security or social
cyber attacks where in fact,

401
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:32,030
and we saw some of this
in the 2016 elections

402
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,233
and in the Brexit elections

403
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,101
where people who are
trying to influence

404
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,372
how you act or how you
vote are very methodical

405
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,375
in presenting information to you

406
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,378
in a way that will appeal to you

407
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,848
so that you will begin to
believe or accept the story

408
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,850
that they want you to accept.

409
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,919
And all of that has
emotional resonance,

410
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,722
that's what they're
appealing to.

411
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,992
So, emotions can
kill and emotions,

412
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,729
if you're not in how
you're thinking about...

413
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,899
Your cyber threat environment,

414
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,334
taking into account emotions,

415
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,405
you're underestimating
your opponent.

416
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,675
So, I wonder a lot
for example about

417
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,012
how emotions might play in terms

418
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,115
of how people perceive
the US or whatever,

419
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,750
in terms of the different actors

420
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,185
that might enter the
cyber threat environment

421
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,787
in the months and years to come.

422
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,324
Okay, now we're talking
about survival strategies.

423
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,865
Construct an analytic landscape.

424
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,403
Now, that is actually my dryer

425
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,339
underneath that little
thing, a picture of it,

426
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,476
and this is the landscape
of the future of warfare

427
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,045
that some analysts
who were working

428
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,781
for me 15 years ago built.

429
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,684
What's interesting about
this is it was an assignment

430
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,120
where I said, "Okay, I
want you all to step back

431
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,190
"from your day-to-day work
and I want you to think

432
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:11,196
"about every element involved
in the future of warfare."

433
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,832
And I gave them two
rules, "And I want you

434
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,135
"to build an analytic
landscape of your issue."

435
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,905
And they said, "What's
an analytic landscape?"

436
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,975
And I said, "I don't know,
and I want you to build it."

437
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,410
And I said, "There's
only two rules.

438
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,248
"You have to consult outsiders
in building your landscape,"

439
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,618
In other words, it can't be
just internal group think,

440
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,388
"and you have to
present it graphically.

441
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,057
"I don't want us to be...

442
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,762
"Kidnapped or held
hostage by words, by text.

443
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,531
"I want you to present it,
you could present it text,

444
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,067
"but I also want you to
present it graphically."

445
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,636
So, they built this using
kind of a Delphi method

446
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:55,407
where they asked people
to rate different aspects

447
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,443
of the issue, (softly
mumbles off mic)

448
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,780
So, the spectrum of
conflict was the bottom

449
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,982
so it's a 3D thing
and they go from

450
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,553
rock throwing to nuclear war,

451
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,425
see if I can see, what's
the one on the side here?

452
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,129
I can't read it.

453
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,863
(audience members mumbling)
Adversary Capability,

454
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,400
of course, we go
from low to high,

455
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,236
an importance to the US
or to whoever your actor,

456
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,404
when from low to high.

457
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,907
And so, you can
imagine that this peak

458
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,043
in the middle could
conceivably been North Korea.

459
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,581
Nuclear warfare,
mid-level capability,

460
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,917
but highly important to the US.

461
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,353
The point of this is not
this particular landscape,

462
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,055
although I think it's very cool

463
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,924
and our customers loved it.

464
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,293
The navy wanted us to
build a simulated version

465
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,896
that their jets
could fly through

466
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,432
or something odd
like that, right?

467
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,699
(laughing)

468
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,736
But you know, it
captured a reality

469
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,172
about the future of warfare

470
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:04,309
that you could not
represent just with words

471
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:09,314
and it forced them to think
about every aspect of it.

472
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,552
And what's important
about this is

473
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,655
that it helps you avoid
the Streetlight Effect.

474
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,990
You're only working on this

475
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,526
because this is what you
have the information on.

476
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,428
By building an
analytic landscape,

477
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,498
another dimension that
you could overlay on it is

478
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,601
how well do we know each area?

479
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:34,172
You could have colored
the mountain ranges
by a color scheme

480
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:37,008
that indicated I feel confident

481
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,810
about my information
in this area,

482
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,679
and I need to know a lot
more about that area.

483
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,049
Once you develop that
analytic landscape,

484
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:49,054
then you have a tool
for shifting attention

485
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,959
and for making sure that
you're not ignoring areas

486
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,494
that could be important.

487
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,797
And I should change this
slide and it should read,

488
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,567
Construct and Revise
Your Analytic Landscape

489
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,669
'cause one of the problems
with all these tools,

490
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,406
'cause you know, we're weak
human beings, we're flawed.

491
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,108
No matter what tool
you hear about,

492
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,909
you're gonna use it as a crutch.

493
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,180
And all of these
tools have limitations

494
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,915
and they particularly
have limitations

495
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,917
if you overly rely on one

496
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,654
or if you use the same
analytic landscape

497
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,389
like for five years in a row.

498
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,925
One of the things I learned
about my analysts at CIA,

499
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,995
or they're not mine, I don't
own them, the analysts at CIA,

500
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,599
was that we had a
program that brought our

501
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,168
classified information
into our inboxes

502
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,172
based on our areas of interest,

503
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,475
and it was sort of like
this Bayesian kind of thing,

504
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,276
this and not this.

505
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,480
And one day, I asked
the analysts, I said,

506
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,450
"How often have you
revised your search query?"

507
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,321
The profile that brings the
information into your inbox,

508
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,188
what do you think I heard?

509
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,691
(audience member shouts off mic)

510
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,195
Five years, never, "I didn't
know you could revise it."

511
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,498
"I'm using the one the
senior analyst gave me

512
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,199
"when I started
eight years ago."

513
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:12,771
It was apoplectic, but
such a simple thing

514
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,608
of such significance had
long been overlooked.

515
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,944
So, construct and
constantly revise

516
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,445
your analytic landscapes.

517
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,381
Apply a category
system of some kind.

518
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,484
I actually think the first step

519
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,753
in analysis is categorization.

520
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,822
It's a necessary step but
can be a very dangerous step

521
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:35,260
because we live and die by
the categories we create.

522
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,231
Now this is my favorite first
order categorization system.

523
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,133
Who knows what his is?

524
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,837
No?

525
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,041
This is the Cynefin
framework, does that help?

526
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,243
C-Y-N-E-F-I-N?

527
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:56,348
No, look it up, C-Y-N-E-F-I-N,
it's a Welsh word I think.

528
00:26:56,348 --> 00:27:00,185
There's so much information
on this on the internet.

529
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:04,121
But it's a guy named David
Snowden, no relation.

530
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,590
(laughing)

531
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,659
And he came up with this
very simple heuristic device

532
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,696
that your problem
can fall into one--

533
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,032
Oops, sorry, went the wrong way.

534
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,900
Your problem can fall
into one of four spaces.

535
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,371
It can be simple, so
that's the problem

536
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,640
where linear analysis
really helps.

537
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,543
It can be complicated, so
it's still cause and effect

538
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:29,014
but there's a lot of causes
and effects so that it's,

539
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,982
the famous Stalin
quote that quantity

540
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,984
has a quality all its own.

541
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,253
So, it just takes more time.

542
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,188
Complicated problem
sets are the ones

543
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,158
where experts are
really helpful.

544
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,261
You don't really need
experts when it's simple,

545
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,864
but experts can really help
you when it's complicated.

546
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,668
Complex is when cause
and effect is unclear

547
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,604
and generally cannot be
determined in advance.

548
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,210
Complex problems
are the problem set

549
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,447
that experts can fail you
because they will apply,

550
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,116
confidently apply
their expertise

551
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,752
and be fooled by randomness.

552
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,088
And then chaotic is
where you never wanna be.

553
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,359
Chaotic is where there's
seemingly no order

554
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,530
and often it happens when an
existing system breaks down.

555
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,365
And for a while,
it's a free for all

556
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,368
and you're not
really sure what are

557
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,071
the important casualties
are going to emerge.

558
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,474
I was thinking when I threw
this up, where is cyber?

559
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,779
Okay, so correct
me if I'm wrong,

560
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:38,483
I sort of thought a lot of
cyber threat intelligence

561
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,820
might be complicated,
in other words,

562
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,254
that you sort of understand
the causes and effects,

563
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,591
but there's so many of them

564
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,693
that they're very
hard to keep track of.

565
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:53,498
But then sometimes it'll kind
of slosh over to complex.

566
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,733
I don't know if anyone...

567
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,535
How many of you think
it's complicated?

568
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,004
I'll just have you
raise your hands.

569
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,072
Ah-ha, how many of you
think it's complex?

570
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,577
Okay, how many of you
think it's chaotic?

571
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,547
Alright, okay, but anyway,

572
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,383
it's just an interesting
thing to think about.

573
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,886
If you think about your domain

574
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:19,624
and maybe your particular
company's profile,

575
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,060
then you could go,
"Okay, you know,

576
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,663
"if it's simple trends,
okay, I can work with trends.

577
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,399
"If it's complex, I
better built myself

578
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,870
"out an analytic landscape
and because it's complex,

579
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,437
"I better revise
it all the time."

580
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,007
That's the way I would use

581
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,376
this very simple
heuristic device.

582
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,812
Know your thinking style.

583
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,783
I know, who doesn't
love Winnie the Pooh?

584
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,019
Oh, gosh, but I
know that I heard

585
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,754
in the introductions
briefly a discussion

586
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,289
about cognitive bias.

587
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:57,428
And we each have to know
what our thinking style is.

588
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:01,266
There are a few instruments
on the internet.

589
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,105
I've used, it's free, the
Gregorc thinking inventory,

590
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:12,110
G-R-E-G-O-R-C, it's
free and it's simple

591
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,014
and it kinda puts
you, are you abstract,

592
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,921
or a concrete thinker, or
are you random or sequential?

593
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,459
I asked a group of intelligence
analysts to take it once

594
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,328
and they all ended up almost

595
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,731
exclusively concrete
sequential thinkers.

596
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,434
So, what that told them,

597
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,536
and they were really
kind of upset about it,

598
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,906
is that they're vulnerable
to not seeing change

599
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,975
because change, sudden change,

600
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,278
is neither concrete nor
sequential, correct?

601
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,950
Right, so understand
your thinking style.

602
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,586
And your thinking style,
there's so many dimensions,

603
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,254
I think that's why
there's not a good test.

604
00:30:56,254 --> 00:31:00,091
But one for example is
optimism versus pessimism.

605
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,993
I'm an optimist by nature.

606
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:06,598
I believe men and women are
basically good but feckless,

607
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,666
so they end up doing
the wrong thing

608
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,501
even though they
had good intentions.

609
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,305
And so, I know that affects
how I think about problems.

610
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,507
I'm one of those
whose likely to think

611
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,010
that a worst case
scenario is unlikely.

612
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:24,015
And so, just knowing that
helps me calibrate my thinking

613
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,083
so I'm a little
bit more effective.

614
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,420
Find a thinking partner.

615
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,324
Now, because I'm
kind of an optimist,

616
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,826
my favorite thinking partner

617
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:39,497
when I was at CIA was an
Eeyore, a real pessimist.

618
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,300
And we knew there was a
disturbance in the force

619
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,469
when she was optimistic
about something

620
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,904
and I was pessimistic
about something,

621
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,073
that's was like a
fascinating outcome to us.

622
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,910
But do you have a
thinking partner?

623
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,280
Do you have more than
one, really, a go-to,

624
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,884
a group of people that you
can explore ideas with?

625
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,754
I was part of the executive team

626
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,958
that took over the analytic
program at CIA after WMD,

627
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,597
9/11, and the Iraq war,
that was a trifecta,

628
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,099
and we spent a lot
of time introducing,

629
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,135
and I'm sure you're
familiar with this,

630
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,437
structured analytic techniques.

631
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,505
And of course, as
I said earlier,

632
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,041
when you introduce a new method,

633
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,908
it tends to become a crutch.

634
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,012
So, everybody was into
structured analytic techniques.

635
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,952
What I like to say is, taking
a walk around the block

636
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,521
with your favorite
thinking partner

637
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,889
is as effective an
analytic technique

638
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,391
as anything you can do.

639
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,964
So, don't ignore the
analog analytic techniques

640
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,634
and having a thinking partner
is a very important one.

641
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,738
Deploy diversity of thought.

642
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,510
In certain domains, diversity
of thought becomes harder

643
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,281
because your domain
does not attract

644
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,517
a full range of thinking styles.

645
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,053
At CIA, for example,

646
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,724
we had 100,000 plus
resumes every year.

647
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:17,328
But I worried that they
did not represent thinkers

648
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,263
who were very creative,

649
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,666
or who were radical
in their approach.

650
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,333
I worried that the only people

651
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,304
who would put their
resume in for the CIA

652
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,407
would be people who sort of saw
the world in black and white

653
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,076
and didn't see a lot of
gray or a lot of color,

654
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,213
and I think that your
domain is a similar domain

655
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,484
where you have an attraction
bias where the people

656
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,853
who come are self-selecting
themselves away.

657
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,455
When I would go to universities,

658
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,024
I would tell the audience
that I was talking

659
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,361
to the people that I
really want to see apply

660
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,564
are the ones who think they
could never work at CIA.

661
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:58,336
You're the people I most
want, and rarely got them.

662
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,405
So, deploy diversity of thought.

663
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:04,876
I have a whole other talk
about diversity of thought

664
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,678
and ways to think about
diversity of thought.

665
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,648
I'm curious, how many of
you manage other people?

666
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,151
Ah, a lot of
people, so I'll talk

667
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,386
about this for a
couple of minutes.

668
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,723
First, diversity of
thought is important.

669
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,094
Organizations that
allow for a lot

670
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,830
of different ideas
have better outcomes

671
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,333
even when the
dissenters are wrong.

672
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,636
So even when the people

673
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,206
who are expressing a
different view are wrong,

674
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,875
the organization still
has better outcomes

675
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,344
and the reason is because
allowing for free-flowing debate

676
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:44,915
leads everyone to
raise their game.

677
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,151
The people that have the
majority point of view,

678
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,319
or the majority opinion,

679
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,123
they work harder when they know

680
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,592
that their team
has vibrant debate.

681
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,427
So, diversity of thought...

682
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,366
Is important, leads
to better outcomes,

683
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,536
particularly the more
complex the tasks,

684
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,539
the more important
diversity of thought is,

685
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,011
and contributes even when
the dissenters are wrong.

686
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,715
So, the literature
shows that very clearly.

687
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,017
The second point I wanna make
about diversity of thought

688
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,053
to your managers is
that it's very hard

689
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,622
to manage diversity of thought

690
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,290
and none of you have
been taught how to do it.

691
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,796
Most organizations want the
organization to run smoothly.

692
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,366
When I was a manager,
people would say,

693
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:39,403
"Oh, you never hear any problems
from Carmen's team, A-OK."

694
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,906
But that's not necessarily
a good indicator

695
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,842
because if you're going to
encourage diversity of thought,

696
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,578
your team is gonna
be crunchy, right?

697
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,480
There's gonna be
differences of opinion

698
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,918
and you haven't been
taught how to do that.

699
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,920
I don't know of any
management program

700
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,289
that actually helps
managers manage

701
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,224
differences of
opinion effectively.

702
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,461
And not only do you have to
manage difference of opinion,

703
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:07,064
you have to conduct yourself
so that your team members know

704
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,167
that you welcome their opinion.

705
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,570
So, a couple of points there.

706
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,340
Very popular today
in organizations is
the stand-up meeting.

707
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,278
Five or 10 minutes, stand
up, that's it, we're done.

708
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,748
When you as a manager

709
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,917
only have a five-to-10-minute,

710
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,085
what are you telling
your reports?

711
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,291
That it better be really
important for them to mention it

712
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,094
because clearly,
this 10-minute limit

713
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,664
on the meeting is very
important to the manager.

714
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,734
So, the way you conduct yourself

715
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:48,739
helps or depresses diversity
of thought in an organization.

716
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,308
Another thing that's
very common for people,

717
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,345
managers to do, is to
talk for 45 minutes,

718
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:59,350
which I'm about to do, and
then say, "Any comments?"

719
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,120
What happens when you talk
most of the time in the meeting

720
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,255
and then you say,
"Any comments?"

721
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,923
What do you get?

722
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,457
You get crickets, right?

723
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,461
The Any Comments is a sign
that the meeting is over.

724
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,395
So, what could you say instead?

725
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,132
As a manager, what
did I get wrong?

726
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,868
How would you do it differently?

727
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,071
What did I miss?

728
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,274
Or even, why don't
you set the agenda

729
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,477
for the meeting next time
and I'll sit in the audience?

730
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,946
So, I could talk
way too much time,

731
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,514
spend to much time on this.

732
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,351
But as a manager, the
way you conduct yourself,

733
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,553
both physically and
with your words,

734
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:39,557
has a lot to do with
whether or not you're able

735
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,892
to operationalize
diversity of thought.

736
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,930
Think together from the start.

737
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,533
Okay, so you've got
diversity of thought,

738
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,002
you've got different
people in your group,

739
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,405
and then often what
happens is that

740
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,743
you don't actually incorporate
the other view points

741
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,345
until later in the process.

742
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,147
So, when you collaborate
toward the end of the process,

743
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,549
you're not collaborating at all.

744
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,285
What you're doing
is deconflicting.

745
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,122
Collaboration much occur
from the beginning.

746
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,824
When you're close to the end
of whatever you're doing,

747
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:17,061
the last thing you want
is someone else's opinion

748
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:20,464
to derail you and make you
start again from alpha.

749
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,199
So, when you collaborate

750
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,368
and you deploy
diversity of thought,

751
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,203
do it from the beginning
of your project,

752
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,106
think together from the start.

753
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,144
And finally, respect
your intuition.

754
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,680
So, we talk a lot about method,

755
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,685
but your brain has a way
of revealing to you things

756
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,254
without articulating it
to your consciousness,

757
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,056
and I'm gonna give
you an example.

758
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,858
I've never actually said
this in public before

759
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:51,195
because I think it's a
little, I don't know,

760
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,831
you'll tell, you
can, you'll decide.

761
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,301
But over the years,
as I drive around,

762
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,171
I'm always observing, looking,

763
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,406
and I've noticed,
I'll be driving

764
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,876
and overtaking a
pedestrian who's walking,

765
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,245
and as I overtake
that pedestrian,

766
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,447
the thought will enter my mind,

767
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,916
"Oh, that person is Asian."

768
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,018
And then I'll go past
him and I'll look

769
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,620
in my rear-view mirror
and they're Asian.

770
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,156
They're Japanese, or
Chinese, or Korean,

771
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:24,161
and every time I'm right, I
think I'm batting like a 6/6,

772
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,232
my number on that, I may
have been mistaken once,

773
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,034
and this is over
many, many years.

774
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,671
It's been at least 10 years
since I noticed that phenomenon.

775
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,174
To this day, I don't know
what it is I'm noticing.

776
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:43,314
I don't know, and I'm not
gonna Google, you know...

777
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,683
I don't even know
what to Google.

778
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,586
So, I'm driving along,
winter or summer,

779
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,189
I notice a person walking along,

780
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,759
and I go, "I think
that person is Asian."

781
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,828
And I think that it has
to do, I don't know,

782
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,797
with the way their head
and their shoulders,

783
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,767
or something relate
to each other.

784
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,435
Whatever it is, I
can't articulate it.

785
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,272
So, my brain has
noticed something

786
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:11,942
that I'm not consciously
able to explain.

787
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,644
That's what intuition is.

788
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:18,115
Intuition is what I think,

789
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,049
at least intuition as it applies

790
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,752
to what we're talking about,

791
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,122
intuition is when your
brain has picked up

792
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,790
on something visually
'cause you know,

793
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,327
your brain is best
at visual processing,

794
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,898
that it can't figure out the
text to explain it to you.

795
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,833
And so, I think it's
always important

796
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,134
to respect that as well.

797
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,837
And I hope that you
feel like this dog,

798
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,441
happy and content.

799
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,442
Thank you very much
for your attention.

800
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,678
