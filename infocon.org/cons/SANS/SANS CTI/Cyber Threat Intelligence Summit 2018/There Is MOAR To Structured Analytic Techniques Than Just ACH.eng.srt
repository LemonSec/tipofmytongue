1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:04,237
(high pitched chiming)

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,512
(applauding)

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,713
- For those that were here
last year certainly know

4
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,483
that I'm a World
War II history geek.

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,852
My company Digital
Shadows started in London

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,054
and I just hit my two
year anniversary last week

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,921
and I've been to
the UK nine times.

8
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,526
And so when I'm there over the
weekends I always go and do

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,328
all kinds of military
history things to see.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,497
Anyone been to RAF
Duxford before?

11
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,199
Any of the Imperial War Museums?

12
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,837
They're awesome, RAX
Duxford is a live museum,

13
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,475
you can be in Spitfires,
they're quite expensive,

14
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,244
you can go up for
45 minute flights.

15
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,712
But I geek out there.

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,313
And some of you may have
seen in previous talks

17
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,082
this analogy I'm gonna
use about analysis

18
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,884
but it's really
relevant for here.

19
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,721
They have a US Aviation
Museum at Duxford.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,390
So of course we have SR-71

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,559
and we have a U-2
kind of positioned

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,827
like Powers would've
potentially been positioned

23
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,296
when he was shot down.

24
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,632
A little bit when I was in
the army I worked with the U-2

25
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,300
as opposed to some
of the other assets

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,303
we also worked with too
but total geek out here for

27
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,739
an intel person, a
military history person

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,707
and general geek,
I love Duxford.

29
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,544
They also have a
land warfare museum.

30
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,381
Does anyone here,
maybe targeting people,

31
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,883
know if this is
a BMP1 or a BMP2?

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,089
So this is a BMP1.

33
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,526
And you can tell, as
a former imagery guy,

34
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,261
the size of the turret
on top is one of the

35
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,330
indicators for it, but I
use this to tell an analogy

36
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,534
of a young specialist
Holland who went TDY

37
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:45,038
or to the Eisenhower
when I was in Kuwait

38
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,140
and I was working
with the ISs there,

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,910
and we were doing imagery
from the TARPS platform

40
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,080
and we were looking
in Southern Iraq

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,382
and specialist
Holland made a mistake

42
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,085
and he called the BMP1 a BMP2.

43
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,553
Does anyone know
the significance of

44
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,690
what this would'a been
between the two Iraq wars?

45
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,693
Only the Republican Guards
Divisions had BMP2s.

46
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,461
So specialist Holland
basically called out

47
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,498
an Iraqi Republican
Guards Division

48
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,299
further south than they
should've been and you know

49
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,503
it hit the fan, things
were spinning up.

50
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,338
There wasn't a lot
of analytical rigor

51
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,273
in specialist
Holland at the time.

52
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,209
And so I use this as a
really good example of

53
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,612
making a mistake,
maybe not having enough

54
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,046
peer review as well.

55
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,815
A lot of analytical failures
didn't really turn out

56
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,650
to be that big of a deal,
but for a little while

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,918
it was a problem.

58
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,220
But I really think it's
a good way to lead into

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,222
analysis matters.

60
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,024
Certainly if you're in
the intelligence community

61
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,126
it might mean
something different

62
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,628
than it would be in
the private sector.

63
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,730
But in the private sector,
could be your livelihood

64
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,332
depending on what type
of work you're doing,

65
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,834
commercial sector,
competitive intelligence,

66
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,369
whatever the case may be.

67
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,138
So I always like to use this
as a lead in on analysis.

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,777
And my personal failure, I like
to make fun of myself a lot.

69
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,712
And there's a lot of
things to make fun of.

70
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,816
Of course, I'm not gonna go
into Dick Heuer Jr's book here,

71
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,286
I've had this on the slides
probably for three years now.

72
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,787
But what I wanted to
try to do is evolve,

73
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,089
is to look back, I spoke
every year at the conference,

74
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,358
I've coordinated the conference

75
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,994
with the advisory board as
well for the past three years.

76
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,262
And so I've had this slide up

77
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,630
and what I was thinking
about this year is like,

78
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,299
OK, enough about just
showing this slide

79
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,767
and telling you
to read this book.

80
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,936
I want to try to move
the conversation forward

81
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,737
on better analysis.

82
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,573
This book, how many
people have read this pdf?

83
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,808
And you can download
it for free right?

84
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,843
One takeaway if you
haven't read this pdf,

85
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,112
highly recommend that you do,

86
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,047
it's probably one of
the top five things

87
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,548
you should read in the space.

88
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,116
Also Thinking Fast and Slow,
but I think the first time

89
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,553
I saw Kahneman talk, she
also recommended that book.

90
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,422
And I read that as a result.

91
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,291
So here's, I'm not gonna
read all this to you,

92
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,027
I was gonna highlight some
of the important parts but

93
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,494
it's really about externalizing

94
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,730
and decomposing our thinking.

95
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,864
I think we have a
lot of lone gunmen,

96
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,702
maybe that's not the best
analogy, people that are

97
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,203
champions, they want
to do it, heroes,

98
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,705
that's what I was
looking for, superheroes.

99
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,307
They want to do it themselves,
they want to save the day,

100
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,343
they want to get all
the kudos for this

101
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,543
incident response
analysis or this

102
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,312
threat intelligence analysis.

103
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,915
And really what I like
about structured analysis

104
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,284
is you're exposing what
you're thinking about

105
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,719
and you're getting
more analytical rigor

106
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,852
into what you're doing.

107
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,824
There's a number of
cognitive biases,

108
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,692
and Carmen mentioned
some of them.

109
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,194
And I'm gonna go
through a couple.

110
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,764
You can do a whole session on
just cognitive biases alone.

111
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,432
But here's confirmation bias.

112
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,134
Facebook right now, if
you looked on Facebook,

113
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,503
it's probably the number one
source of confirmation bias

114
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,104
in these hyper political times.

115
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,375
Another one is mirror imaging.

116
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,411
Anyone familiar with mirror
imaging or Into the Dragon?

117
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,314
So if you've seen this
movie, it's probably

118
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,149
one of the top five
movies ever made.

119
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,120
He's being attacked,
he's being scratched,

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,122
and essentially he has
to break the mirrors.

121
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,957
So you actually need to
do this for your analysis,

122
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,325
you need to break
through your mirrors.

123
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,494
Mirror imaging is
basically when you look at,

124
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,829
and you make an assessment
through your lens

125
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,632
and not the person who may
be targeting you's lens.

126
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,669
You're not taking into context
their social situation,

127
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,837
their geopolitical
situation, them,

128
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,240
there's actually a technique
called red hat analysis.

129
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,775
I'm not gonna talk
about it today really

130
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,277
but they can be used to
overcome mirror imaging.

131
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,780
Anchoring.

132
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,316
I think Carmen also mentioned
anchoring in one context.

133
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,751
Is anyone familiar
with anchoring?

134
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,620
We actually see this a lot
with university students.

135
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,989
At my company we
recruit a lot of people

136
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,556
from King's College in London,

137
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,694
graduate programs in
intelligence studies and

138
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,630
there's a tendency with students
that go through programs

139
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,633
that maybe the first analytical
technique they stick with.

140
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,669
So you can anchor on the
techniques that you know,

141
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,705
and then you can
also anchor on maybe

142
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,606
the first assessment
that you have.

143
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,276
And then perhaps, it
becomes, oh this is the way

144
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,011
it's always been so it's gonna
stay this way type of piece.

145
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,714
So we don't want to anchor
either our techniques

146
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,682
or our assessments.

147
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,150
And then of course groupthink.

148
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,818
And I think everyone's
familiar with groupthink.

149
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,355
I think this is a
pretty good illustration

150
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,489
of groupthink as well.

151
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,758
And this is what

152
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,663
psychologists who coined
the term groupthink,

153
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:07,033
Irving Janis talked
about these conditions

154
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,868
that make groupthink possible.

155
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,603
I'm not gonna read
through them all

156
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,238
but if you look at
your org structure,

157
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,773
if you're maybe a student,

158
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,275
a fan of organizational
behavior, some of these things

159
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,443
might reside in
your organizations.

160
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,780
But there's one in particular
that I highlighted in red,

161
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,116
those are situational factors
that contribute to groupthink.

162
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,349
And I think it's
really important

163
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,785
for this audience
to be aware of.

164
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,553
How many people would
describe themselves

165
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,889
as this individual
in their jobs?

166
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,457
Are you ever tired?

167
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,959
Are you ever stressed out?

168
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,028
Are you ever working long
days stuck on a console

169
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,965
for ArcSight or looking
at packet captures?

170
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:42,135
The very nature of our
role, no matter if you're an

171
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,770
incident responder
or intel analyst,

172
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,270
anyone in cybersecurity today

173
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,573
in the threat landscape
we have, is you're tired.

174
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,643
So we really need to
be aware that fatigue

175
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,111
can cause groupthink, and
really try to take steps

176
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,215
to protect ourselves or
take care of ourselves

177
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,816
to try to avoid that.

178
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,720
Sleeping more than four hours
a night is highly recommended.

179
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,321
One of my New Years
Resolutions was try to sleep

180
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,857
seven hours a night, I'm
not doing very good at it.

181
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,928
It's ACH, how many
people have done ACH

182
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,963
in their careers at some point?

183
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,231
There's a fair amount of hands.

184
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,033
With this audience
I would expect it.

185
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,602
This is an ACH that we did

186
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,272
at Digital Shadows on
WannaCry and actually

187
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,841
made the Internet Storm Center.

188
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,577
But I don't want
to talk about ACH.

189
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,712
I was not exposed to
actually doing ACHs

190
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,381
until I've been in my
career at Digital Shadows

191
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,082
and I actually think
they're a pain in the ass.

192
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,218
They take a lotta time.

193
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,886
Even understanding,
as you're setting up

194
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,388
the assumptions that
you would have in it,

195
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,623
the scenarios you would have
in it takes a lot of time.

196
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,992
But ACH is probably one
that gets the most headlines

197
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,528
these days, people are talking
about them and using them.

198
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,496
So I want to think beyond that.

199
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,729
So I'm not gonna talk about ACH

200
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,432
'cause I actually think
it takes too much time

201
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,734
and there's other
techniques that you can use.

202
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,171
There's a whole lot of
techniques that you can use.

203
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,240
So just a small, and
I have the reference

204
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,376
to this book at the end
of probably 40 different

205
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,611
structured analytic
techniques on this slide.

206
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,448
Is anyone familiar
with this book?

207
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,686
I've got it at the end,

208
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,421
it's like a 70 or $80 book,

209
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,556
it's probably not a bad thing
to expense for your teams

210
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,091
that are out there
and they break down

211
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,360
all these structured
analytic techniques.

212
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,963
I think it's very
overwhelming in trying to know

213
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,798
the right ones to use
in the right situation

214
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,633
is pretty important.

215
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,668
So I was gonna talk
through a couple things

216
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,504
that you might do in
your organization.

217
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,874
As you start to incorporate
structured analytics

218
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,077
into your programs, and I
think you really should,

219
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,678
I'm gonna go through a
scenario and go through

220
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,847
a couple here, but
you could kind of,

221
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,716
and what I've been trying
to do here is line it up

222
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,417
to the tactical operational
and strategic goals

223
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,486
that you might have from
an intel perspective

224
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,054
on different types of
structured analytic techniques

225
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:44,323
that you can use.

226
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,893
I'm a newbie on this.

227
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,862
Rob in his intro said
no one's a pro here,

228
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,795
no one's an expert.

229
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,832
I am by no means an expert in

230
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,400
structured analytic techniques.

231
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,936
But I have been
working with them,

232
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,171
I've done structure
brainstorming, I've done ACH,

233
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,241
I've done SWATS, red hat
analysis, cone of possibility.

234
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,876
But you probably
are gonna have some

235
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,444
that are gonna be
in your stable, and
you're gonna use them

236
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,546
and it's important to refresh
them from time to time.

237
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,750
But what I would recommend
is you start to try to map

238
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,184
different techniques
to different things

239
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,653
that you're gonna produce
in your environment.

240
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,054
How many people on an
ongoing basis in the room

241
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,356
actually have structured
analysis built in

242
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,625
to the different intelligence
products you create?

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,629
I see one hand, and
that's an Army hand.

244
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,699
So typically that's
what you'll find.

245
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,901
Unless you're maybe a very large

246
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,471
Silicon Valley
technology company

247
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,041
with large intelligence
teams, or you come from

248
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,043
the intelligence community
you're not doing this.

249
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,477
But the whole point
of my talk today is

250
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,180
that you don't have to
do these crazy ass ACH

251
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,815
that take a lot of time,
potentially take a lot of time.

252
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,618
Once you have them down
you can do them quicker.

253
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,753
There's an easy way
to do it, or easier.

254
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,991
And this is the common,
this is the third time

255
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,859
over the past six months
at a conference where I've

256
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,294
talked about this topic.

257
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,996
And I'll talk to people
afterwards and really

258
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,699
this is what comes back, is
we don't have time for this.

259
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,934
Our hair is on fire,
we don't have time

260
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,169
to add new things in.

261
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,971
What I would say is you
probably already doing

262
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,573
some types of analytics,
structured analytics

263
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,408
that maybe you hadn't
thought about and maybe

264
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,377
you just need to formalize
a little bit more.

265
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,512
So I want to go
through a scenario,

266
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:19,352
and in this scenario you have
a recently promoted CISO,

267
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,353
let's call him Mick.

268
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,022
Mick came from the
intelligence community.

269
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,226
So he's really into the
intelligence trade craft

270
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,996
and of course like all
CISOs or C-level folks,

271
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,530
he reads the Wall
Street Journal.

272
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,933
And he just saw this
headline this week

273
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,968
in the Wall Street
Journal and tell me if

274
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,236
this has ever happened to you.

275
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,771
The CISO comes and
knocks on your doors

276
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,406
and wants to know about this
article in New York Times,

277
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,309
Financial Times,
Wall Street Journal

278
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,276
and starts a fire drill
for your organization.

279
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,313
Has that happened
to anyone before?

280
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,615
Yeah yeah, well now I'm
the one doing that now.

281
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,655
So this is Mick our
fictional CISO's response

282
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,923
to this and he really wants
to know what's gonna happen

283
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:58,924
for the organization.

284
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,529
So I'm gonna walk through this
hypothetical ish situation.

285
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,598
I'm gonna do two techniques,
we'll walk through,

286
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,065
it's really to give
you a flavor of

287
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,201
how you could try to apply
this to a real world scenario

288
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,938
from your CISO that's
zomygod-ing the news.

289
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,375
So we won't go into detail
on some of these things,

290
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,110
others we will, but I just
want to give you a flavor

291
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,345
of how you can
actually incorporate

292
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,813
something like this
into your program.

293
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,182
And you could use other
techniques as well.

294
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,150
Just a flavor.

295
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,520
So one that I think is
really, really important

296
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,388
and actually doesn't
take a ton of time

297
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,723
is a key assumptions check.

298
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,824
I think this is really important

299
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,059
for a lot of different things.

300
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,526
For those of us that
are on the vendor side

301
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,730
and we're producing our super
cool intelligence reports,

302
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,232
this sort of stuff, if
you're on the vendor side,

303
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,968
you're writing research
that you're using for

304
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,905
thought leadership
marketing purposes,

305
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:50,108
you really should be doing
a lot of structured analysis

306
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,644
inside of your research.

307
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,546
But key assumptions check
is really really important.

308
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,015
It's the foundation of
your intelligence product.

309
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,817
And if you're making
faulty assumptions,

310
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,985
and in intelligence
there's no certainty right?

311
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,120
We don't know everything,

312
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,888
so it's really
important to do this.

313
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,991
This goes back to

314
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,495
what Carmen was talking about
is you need to have a culture

315
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,031
that will allow you to question
other peoples' assumptions.

316
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,800
Right we have to not have
hubris, we need to be humble,

317
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,604
we need to recognize that
we don't know everything,

318
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,140
that another perspective
could be a better perspective

319
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,842
or complement your perspective.

320
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,977
So you really want to
understand the evidence

321
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,512
and reasoning behind something.

322
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,814
So in the scenario that
we're walking through

323
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,818
on cryptocurrency
fraud, Mick our CISO

324
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,787
works for a financial
institution,

325
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,022
so he's definitely concerned
about the implications

326
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,059
of cryptocurrency in general
and then fraud in particular.

327
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,594
We've got a number
of key assumptions.

328
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,330
And so these are the
assumptions there.

329
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,335
A couple of new alternative
coins and exchanges will emerge,

330
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,837
cryptocurrencies will
eventually be adopted

331
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,140
by major retailers and
financial institutions.

332
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,040
Some of these are
trailing trends anyway,

333
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,476
but we're making
those assumptions

334
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,278
and we're making
them clear up front.

335
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,313
So whenever you start any
type of analytical process,

336
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:05,351
whoever the team is working on
writes these assumptions down

337
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,486
and then if you're
fans of Silicon Valley,

338
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,588
you get the stick it notes out.

339
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,625
And actually Carmen
referenced this

340
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,460
with structured brainstorming,
another way that

341
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,095
you can do this
exercise as well,

342
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,063
you get the sticky pads out.

343
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,999
And you start to ask
yourself these questions

344
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,801
about the assumptions
that you've made.

345
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,803
What would make an
assumption untrue?

346
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,806
What if it was true in the
past but it's no longer true?

347
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,042
Assign a confidence
level to the assumption,

348
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,644
and then basically,
and there's some others

349
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,878
that you can add
to the mix here,

350
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,079
but that's a high level
of what you would do.

351
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,347
You ask these questions
about each of these

352
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,817
key assumptions and
then you rate them.

353
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,518
This is solid, we
feel really good

354
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,120
about this assumption,
it's valid.

355
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,322
It's caveated, meaning
something must happen

356
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,224
in order for this,
or it's unsupported.

357
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,927
And then if it's
unsupported, throw it out.

358
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,929
So I would say for any kind
of intelligence product,

359
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,731
this is the type of activity
that you'll want to have.

360
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,967
And this is not something
that's gonna take a long time.

361
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,769
You could do this in an hour.

362
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,572
And I'm gonna talk about some
remote and collaboration tools

363
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,073
you can use as well.

364
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,776
For my organization, I have
people from Greece to London,

365
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,612
East Coast, Central, West Coast.

366
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,981
So it's a large
distributed team.

367
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,016
So there's some
challenges there as well.

368
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,887
So now we have the assumptions.

369
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,988
And one of the things about
the key assumptions check,

370
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,525
even if you were to do an
ACH, there's many of these

371
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,826
techniques where assumptions

372
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,294
are gonna be a component of it.

373
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,097
So this is using one
structured analytic technique

374
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,598
to build upon another.

375
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:31,136
Has anyone ever worked with
scenario planning or futures?

376
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,839
Has anyone ever done a
cone of plausibility?

377
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,274
So this is looking forward.

378
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,643
And what I like about
this, especially as a CISO,

379
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,179
what I'm trying to accomplish
here in this example

380
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,048
is how you could take some
intelligence assessments

381
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,050
and actually then use
them in your program.

382
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,419
We talk about this
panacea of intelligence

383
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,722
informing business
decisions and giving you

384
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,891
decision advantage over your
blah blah blah blah blah.

385
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,995
My goal here is to try
to start thinking about

386
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,530
how we could actually
do some of this stuff.

387
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,031
So cone of plausibility.

388
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,134
This is a forecasting technique.

389
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,636
Often times you'll
see it in larger

390
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,670
intelligence organizations
and may do them further out,

391
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,574
you know 2025,
what can we expect.

392
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,478
I like to make fun of forecasts.

393
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,079
Not the forecasts
but the predictions.

394
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,314
As Rob said I was a Forrester
analyst and every year

395
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,851
in October we'd do
these predictions.

396
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,119
And I always like to
talk about forecasts

397
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,620
and not predictions
because there was no

398
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,757
analytic rigor really in the
predictions that I would make

399
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,724
as an industry analyst.

400
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,761
I don't know that I was
blind to that fact then,

401
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,329
but what I like about
forecasts is at least you have

402
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,565
some rigor that's going
into your thought process

403
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,234
that you're using here.

404
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,202
So essentially what you're
trying to do is project trends,

405
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,104
events and their consequences,

406
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,206
and you look at
scenarios that occur.

407
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,742
And I think from a business
that is trying to plan out

408
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,310
the implications of something,

409
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,281
in this case cryptocurrency
fraud in 2018 and 2019,

410
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,215
you can start to talk about
things in the business

411
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,952
that they might care about
and then you start to,

412
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,188
I'll walk through it, let
me not get ahead of myself.

413
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,990
I have a reference for
all the things that

414
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,792
I'm talking about I've
got references at the end.

415
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,627
So you have one slide
that you can just look at,

416
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,027
it's similar to what
I did last year.

417
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,263
If you look at that
one slide you can just

418
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,432
hyperlink out to
all these things.

419
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,534
So there's a lot of things
in the cone of plausibility

420
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,336
as far as the framework goes.

421
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,805
Understanding the
current conditions,

422
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,907
so the drivers and
the assumptions.

423
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,377
How many people are familiar
with the PESTLE model?

424
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,679
So you can use the PESTLE model

425
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,648
to help do the drivers
an assumptions but

426
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,650
what's driving
the current state?

427
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,552
What are the key assumptions
that you're making

428
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:30,622
about the state, basically
new alternative coins

429
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,257
are gonna come, new
exchanges are gonna come,

430
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,026
fraud's gonna continue
what we went through

431
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,294
on the previous one.

432
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,795
And then you build
out the scenarios.

433
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,131
And so you have a
preferred scenario

434
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,132
which in my experience
in doing these preferred

435
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,135
really never
happens, a probable,

436
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,603
and then you have wild cards.

437
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,305
Now the wild cards, I
think one other thing that

438
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,542
we need more of from analysis
perspective is creativity.

439
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,078
So wild cards is you just
pick something that's

440
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,613
super random that you
may not have thought of,

441
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,383
completely out of the box,

442
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,219
and you have that as a scenario.

443
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,487
So it's really just
to kind of challenge

444
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,122
the thought that you
have, and basically

445
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,324
what you then do is you
monitor for these scenarios

446
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,792
and then you come up
with countermeasures

447
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,793
for those scenarios,
it'll be the process.

448
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,162
We'll walk through
it a little bit more.

449
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,964
But I really think
the wild card one,

450
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,800
in the ones that we've done
internally at Digital Shadows

451
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,702
it's kind of fun to do that one.

452
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,973
One that we did about
12 months ago was around

453
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,341
DDoS botnets and we were
trying to think about

454
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,344
how extortion
actors might change,

455
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm sorry with IoT
botnets, doing DDoS,

456
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,616
and so one of the wild
card scenarios we had,

457
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,917
and we've seen a
little bit of this but

458
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,521
not on a grand scale was
gonna be grand scale of

459
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,389
crowdsourcing extortion
so instead of extorting

460
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,727
the brand, it's Christmas
and Rick wants to get on

461
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,731
Xbox Live or PlayStation,
and we take it down

462
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,566
and now I'm like OK
Rick, if you pay me

463
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,803
$100 and we crowdsource
that, then we'll bring

464
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,337
the service back online.

465
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,106
So that was just one
example of a wild card

466
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,441
scenario that we did there.

467
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,512
So this one, it's not as
bad to read on that screen,

468
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,749
it's kind of what it looks
like from a large scale.

469
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,453
You've got the drivers
that you've come up with.

470
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,088
And here the drivers
for this scenario is

471
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,091
the accessibility of the
technology, the anonymity

472
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,295
that you have, or
lack of anonymity

473
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,064
as some of the cyber
criminals are finding out,

474
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,101
popularity and high
reputation, the opportunity,

475
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,237
there's all kinds of opportunity
for fraud, the users,

476
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,674
the exchanges, the platforms,

477
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,777
regulation or lack
thereof regulation.

478
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,378
And then the security
of individuals,

479
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,080
consumers and organizations.

480
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,449
Again, this is just
to be illustrative
of what you could do

481
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,252
for this and your
organization may not have

482
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,787
anything to do with
cryptocurrency.

483
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,022
Then we have the assumptions
that we talked through

484
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,126
before on the previous slide,
and then we have scenarios.

485
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,562
And really at a high level
in scenarios preferable is

486
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,697
law enforcement gets
their act together,

487
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,702
regulations come into place
and the risk level goes down.

488
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,571
Pretty unlikely I think for
most things in our area.

489
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,540
The most probable one, and
I'm gonna walk through that

490
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,643
in subsequent slides,
is the cyber criminals

491
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,946
continue to innovate, they
target the cryptocurrencies,

492
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,349
the exchanges, they're
having a lot of success,

493
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,817
they're making a lot of profit.

494
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,885
You might even see

495
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,787
other types of networks
that may have been used

496
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,923
for ransomware that
are moving over to this

497
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,759
particular piece on crypto
jacking as an example.

498
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,897
And then in wild card scenario
here, heavy regulation,

499
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:29,768
decrease of anonymity,
the fraudulent attacks...

500
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,171
(mumbling) Water.

501
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,439
The number of targets
greatly decrease

502
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,075
and this just goes away as well.

503
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,279
So unlikely on that
scenario as well.

504
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,581
So here we're a
financial institution.

505
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,117
Mick the CISO he's concerned
about the exchanges

506
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,186
and the customers,
the employees there.

507
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,388
So you have your scenario
so you go through,

508
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,790
you understand the drivers,
you have the key assumptions.

509
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,226
You think about two
or three scenarios

510
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,894
and maybe you just
plan for the probable

511
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,596
because that's all
you have time for.

512
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,498
And then you start
to monitor for that.

513
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,601
You want to be able to
monitor changes over time

514
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,603
that indicate this
is about to occur.

515
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,906
And then you want, you
develop courses of action.

516
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,608
Of course military
people will understand

517
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,110
courses of action but
this would be your plan.

518
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,313
So for me, Mick the CISO
trying to understand

519
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,116
what do we need to do
practically about this threat.

520
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,519
So several things that
I would, trying to take

521
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,521
a change in the threat
landscape and tie it back

522
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,990
to my security program and
how I might make investments

523
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,259
or de-invest in certain areas.

524
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,395
So things that I would want
to do in this particular case,

525
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,132
we know that criminals
are trying to use
your Amazon Compute

526
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,469
for crypto jacking, so you're
paying for them to mine

527
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,371
Monero, Bitcoin,
whatever the case may be.

528
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,740
We see more Monero,
a lot of cases.

529
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,776
But here, do I have a
capability to monitor GitHub?

530
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,980
Now GitHub does a really good
job of take down requests.

531
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,448
There's a lot of
misconfiguration.

532
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,016
Let's talk about something
that in our programs

533
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,885
like shadow IT, GitHub is
a really painful component

534
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,288
of shadow IT, so here
I want to understand

535
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,690
what's out here on GitHub,
what misconfigurations

536
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,792
did someone do that
shouldn't be there

537
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,793
that's exposing risk
to my organization?

538
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:06,164
And then you start to see
your Amazon bill going up.

539
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,166
So this is one practical
thing that I might,

540
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,967
I may not have a
capability to do this.

541
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,171
How can I do this,
start monitoring that?

542
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,441
Another one, now
this one probably is

543
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,709
appropriate for
everything right?

544
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,978
This is web browser so
this is crypto jacking

545
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:24,216
of your users' browsers
themselves which

546
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,418
crypto jacking in and of itself,

547
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,288
using your browser
resources it reminds me of,

548
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,556
people remember
SETI@home back in the day

549
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,725
where you could my
computer to, that's what

550
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,128
actually I kinda think
about crypto jacking.

551
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,764
I actually wouldn't
mind a SETI like

552
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,599
if I was gonna let
someone mine my computer.

553
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,501
It was a non profit,
let's say it's

554
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,870
a cancer research center
or something like that,

555
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,737
I'm not necessarily
opposed to letting them

556
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,608
mine my browser if it's
gonna help them get Monero

557
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,943
that they can use for
research so it's not to say

558
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,514
that all of this crypto
jacking is necessarily bad.

559
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,381
There is some good
out there potentially.

560
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,518
But here we want to look
at our browser security

561
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,486
and the controls that
we have extensions.

562
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,223
And I would guess for
a lot of organizations

563
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,591
this is probably a weak
area of their configuration

564
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,428
and patch management in general.

565
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,697
And this obviously
helps out way more

566
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,532
than just a crypto
jacking scenario right?

567
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,199
This is everything
scenario since the browser

568
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,437
is such a prevalent
attack pattern.

569
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,039
Another one, Have I Been
Pwned, this is something

570
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,374
that you can do for free.

571
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,942
You can go out and look
at your organization.

572
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,878
You can also subscribe
to it as well,

573
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,379
but Troy Hunt puts
together these databases.

574
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,883
So Mick the CISO wants to
know if any of my employees

575
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,952
have been using their
corporate email address

576
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,288
to register on one
of these exchanges

577
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,889
that they're on, that
exchange gets popped,

578
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,726
they drain all of
the coin from them,

579
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,929
transfer it out, and then
they have the email addresses

580
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,464
of everyone out there.

581
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,232
So what kind of risk does
Mick the CISO's team have

582
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,168
from employees that are reusing
their corporate credentials

583
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,004
even just the email
address, right,

584
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,707
and these exchanges
get compromised?

585
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,977
So this also then becomes a
multi-factor authentication

586
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,479
conversation as well.

587
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,682
So again what I'm trying
to do is map this threat

588
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,517
that you get from the
Wall Street Journal

589
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,086
taking it down to how
do you actually change

590
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,021
your security
program as a result?

591
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,692
Another one, and I think this
one is an interesting one

592
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,962
we were talking about, if
you think about Millennials,

593
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,132
Millennials are more apt to
invest in cryptocurrencies.

594
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,034
I actually see it as
an opportunity, one is

595
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,872
I need to cover this in my
security awareness training.

596
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,940
How many people have
run security awareness

597
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,776
programs in their careers?

598
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,979
They're tough, and the way
you get people to connect,

599
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,614
you talk about threats
to their family,

600
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,550
to their children, well here,

601
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,252
for the Millennials that
are interested in this,

602
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,753
this might be a way
to connect with them,

603
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,754
and then you talk
about hey look.

604
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,092
There's all kinds of
fake exchanges set up,

605
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,760
fake platforms for
trading, just understand

606
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,263
the overall risk, if you
want to make the investment

607
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,964
that's fine, that's
your business.

608
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,198
We're not gonna give
you investment advice

609
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,434
but just know the risk there.

610
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,635
Oh by the way, here's
some other things

611
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,103
that you want to think about.

612
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,338
So this could be an
opportunity to take again

613
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,041
this Wall Street
Journal zomygod article

614
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,609
and actually do something
in my organization

615
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,845
to try to level up the
security a little bit.

616
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,147
So what can you do?

617
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,887
There's a couple things
and these aren't gonna be,

618
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,088
some things that'll
be interesting,

619
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,658
some are more obvious.

620
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,859
But one, has anyone read this

621
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,828
Cases in Intelligence Analysis?

622
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,763
This is almost like
a compendium book.

623
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,165
It's really good, we just
started in the Dallas office

624
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,469
with our intel analysts, we're
starting to take an event,

625
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,804
and basically it could
be something like

626
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,906
attempted assassination of

627
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,709
anti-Putin journalist in Russia,

628
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,678
things that have happened
historically and then

629
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,948
this is a workbook and
they'll give you two to three

630
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,784
structured analytic
techniques to work through.

631
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,687
What I have found to
be the most valuable is

632
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,955
Harrison's one of
the guys I do it with

633
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,224
in my office in Dallas
is just us talking.

634
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,461
We're in a room, we're
discussing these things

635
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,330
and it's just, the mere
fact that you're having

636
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,966
communication maybe goes
back to Carmen's point about

637
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,467
it's not as much about
the structured analytics

638
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,337
as it is about better analysis.

639
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,906
This has been a really
good way for us to do that

640
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,942
within our intel team
out of the Dallas office.

641
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,945
So especially if you're
a history buff as well,

642
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,647
you'll like this 'cause
you're going back to

643
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,983
all sorts of, there's
20 of them in there.

644
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,752
In the books, maybe 60,
about something like that.

645
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,954
So recommended take-home
assignment for you.

646
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:28,627
Google Docs, this is one,
now I will caveat this with

647
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,062
I realize Google
Docs is in the cloud.

648
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,998
So you could use another
solution but conceptually

649
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,500
either you host your
own solution but

650
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,068
what I like about Google
Docs, we used to use this

651
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,604
at Forrester, we'd
have all the analysts,

652
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,973
I think we had 12
analysts on the team,

653
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,207
and we would be brainstorming

654
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,809
at the beginning
of the year about

655
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,745
the threat landscape,
customer pain points,

656
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,214
what do we want to write about?

657
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,447
And it would be ready
set go and then everybody

658
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:54,352
just starts throwing
up ideas on there

659
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,954
and just seeing them pop
pop different colors.

660
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:59,558
Has anyone ever used Google
Docs in this context before?

661
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,526
It's a really good
technique especially,

662
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,295
especially for remote teams.

663
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,463
And I think that's a
big problem that we have

664
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,331
just in general, especially
as there's a trend

665
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,601
for more remote workforce,
and you want to enable

666
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,604
your own remote employees
so I really like this model.

667
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,040
And then essentially what
you do is you start to

668
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,475
group these ideas together
and you put them here

669
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,744
and then maybe you do a key
assumptions check on that.

670
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,346
So it's a way that
you can start off with

671
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,048
structured brainstorming,
then you do

672
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,616
key assumptions check,
then you can move on

673
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,551
to whatever else it may be.

674
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,887
This could be you're
brainstorming on
the threat landscape

675
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,656
for your organization
in 2018 and beyond.

676
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,457
Maybe this is on the vendor
side and you're trying

677
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,794
to think of really exciting
research and capabilities

678
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,228
that you have that
you want to highlight.

679
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,764
Whatever the case may be,
Google Docs is one route to go.

680
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,034
Then, you can go big.

681
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:46,671
Now I do think, anybody here a
developer in a previous life?

682
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,841
Developers, it's not
the same everywhere,

683
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,177
but developers do a pretty
good job of collaborating,

684
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,778
especially when you have
remote product management

685
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,013
and development teams.

686
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,747
But there's tools
like Google Jamboard

687
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,483
where you actually
have a big TV like this

688
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,619
and it's interactive and
I can draw ideas on it

689
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,353
and then I can use
it on my phone,

690
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,955
can use it on a tablet as well.

691
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,491
So it really helps with
both in person collaboration

692
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,461
for those in the office, as
well as people that are remote.

693
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,764
The TV is like five
grand so this is,

694
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,931
you're starting to (mumbling)
a little bit more but

695
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,134
if you think of a
threat intelligence team

696
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,203
and you want to have a
better collaboration,

697
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,704
and this doesn't
necessarily have to be,

698
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,072
this could be other things
besides threat intelligence

699
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,675
this could be, I want
to draw the architecture

700
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,211
of my environment
in a real time view

701
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,545
so that we get a
better understanding

702
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,180
of what our
architecture looks like.

703
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,182
And Google Jamboard
is not alone.

704
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,819
Stormboard has, it's
a Canadian company.

705
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,855
They have an OnPrem
version as well.

706
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,891
This is one I created
last night on my own.

707
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,359
And you can put
the note cards on.

708
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,593
So you could put
the note cards up,

709
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,062
everyone could do that
and then you could group

710
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,729
the note cards and
things like that.

711
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,100
So there are some pretty nice
collaboration tools out there

712
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,834
that you can use,
again, you can have some

713
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,570
that you host yourself so
you don't have to worry about

714
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,838
this being in the cloud.

715
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,373
A lot of the
collaboration tools,

716
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,010
if the content you're working
on isn't sensitive in nature,

717
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,114
they plug into Box, they plug
into all the CESS applications

718
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,983
and it's a really
convenient way to work.

719
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,685
Again, it depends on the content

720
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,653
and sensitivity that
you're working on.

721
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,322
And Carmen actually
mentioned this,

722
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,259
cued me up here with IARPA.

723
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,129
So IARPA has funded, I think
it's about 50 million across

724
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,899
four universities
to do research in,

725
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,668
CREATE is the name
of the program,

726
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,204
but Crowdsourcing,
Evidence, Augmentation,

727
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,139
Thinking and Evaluation.

728
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,742
If you want to put
a Google alert down

729
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,945
on something to track,
this, the first,

730
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,648
it's been in place I think
maybe it's May of this year,

731
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,382
these universities are gonna
present their findings.

732
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,586
Now I don't know how much of
it will actually go public

733
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,855
but this is a good one
to put a Google alert on.

734
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,690
And here's three of
the specific products,

735
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,158
projects that
they're working on.

736
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,294
Some of them are more
focused on crowdsourcing,

737
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,899
of analysis, using AI with that.

738
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,834
In this case, when it's
a university person

739
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,770
talking about AI versus
vendor marketing,

740
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,507
I'm more inclined to believe
their AI or maybe not

741
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,175
have as much distaste for it.

742
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,078
'Cause I am firmly in the
camp of (audio muting)

743
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,981
machine learn and AI all the
things is the wrong approach.

744
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,485
Maybe that's my bias from
being analyst, it is,

745
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,121
my bias from being an
analyst at Forrester

746
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,256
and getting machine
learned to death

747
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,091
from everyone out there.

748
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,994
Swarm is a wiki, when
you can ask questions

749
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,163
and get responses back.

750
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,533
Trace is another
collaborative tool.

751
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,702
I don't know what these
applications will actually

752
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,871
come out being, but
there could be something

753
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,039
that we could leverage in the
commercial sector as well.

754
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,441
And then of course
for our friends

755
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,776
in the intelligence
community, you may very well

756
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,210
be able to use these
types of solutions

757
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,512
in the next several years.

758
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:45,150
The one thing I would
say is this, SATS are not

759
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,186
silver bullets, just
because you have

760
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,120
structured analytic techniques

761
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,023
doesn't mean you're
not gonna fail.

762
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:56,293
Intelligence is, at best,
a guessing game right?

763
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,129
Hopefully we can do a
little bit more than that.

764
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,299
So don't think it could
be this false sense of

765
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,700
look at all this analytic rigor.

766
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,202
We had these three
techniques that were used

767
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,238
in the production of this
particular product or asset

768
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,406
and it's good to go.

769
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,041
No you cannot be
complacent with these,

770
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,208
you need to revise the tool set,

771
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,311
Carmen talked
about that as well.

772
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,414
And I think this
is a great quote.

773
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,783
I often ask if this
is an overdone quote.

774
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,554
It depends, is this an overdone
quote for this audience?

775
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,789
OK.

776
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,024
I like it.

777
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,391
Tell me what you know,
what you don't know

778
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,027
and then most importantly,
what you think

779
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,929
is most likely to
happen based on that.

780
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,665
I think this is what's really
really important for us.

781
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,834
I think if you look at the
way we've been focused,

782
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,603
very much indicator
focused over the years,

783
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,773
some of this stuff isn't, this
is an abstract level above

784
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:46,276
where we're at but I think
just knowing what you know,

785
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,279
knowing what you don't
know is the tough piece.

786
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,715
This goes back to the Rumsfeld
analogy a little bit too

787
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,250
right the unknown unknowns.

788
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,651
But at least for the
things that you know,

789
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,353
what's your confidence
level around

790
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,956
that realm that you do know it?

791
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,925
We know it really well or
we don't know it that well.

792
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,928
I think this is a really
important one to go off of.

793
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,463
That's a picture from last year.

794
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,931
I just was gonna throw up
a thank you slide on there

795
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,233
and I found that was
our monument walk

796
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,834
that we did last year.

797
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,338
I did put as a reference, a
number of different things

798
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,772
that I put on here, and
if you want to go through

799
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,208
an actual painful exercise,
that second to bottom,

800
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,778
PARC ACH Software, has
anyone ever used it?

801
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,048
Do you like it?
- It's so old.

802
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,216
- Yeah yeah.

803
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,485
Might just be better to
go with the spreadsheet.

804
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,221
It could be a little
bit easier but

805
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,125
actually PARC's got some
other tools out there as well.

806
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,327
There's different references,
some stuff from Rand,

807
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,597
a couple different pdfs that
you can download as well.

808
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,800
The one call that I
would have on this,

809
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,335
and I don't know if a Slack
channel's the right way

810
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:48,172
to do it but I really want
to foster more conversation

811
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,442
about better analysis
in our space.

812
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,212
So if you're interested in this,

813
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,680
if you're passionate about
it, if you have experience,

814
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,248
please reach out to me.

815
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,384
I'd like to form some sort
of group where we can talk

816
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,687
and collaborate on this and
then further it for the field.

817
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,187
I don't know what
it's gonna look like.

818
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,057
These may not be the right
things for your organization

819
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,060
but I do think as we look
to mature where we're at

820
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,428
as an industry
and practitioners,

821
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,330
we need to be doing
better analysis.

822
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,899
Thank you.
(applauding)

823
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,603
(upbeat music)
