1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,069
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,946
(audience applause)

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,414
- How many people
here in the room

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,918
support an organization that
sends people to the G20?

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,919
Any involvement?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,455
I'm seeing one, okay.

7
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,025
So, like he said, the way
that I, if I were you,

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,461
taking this talk and
making it practical,

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,665
take G20 out and insert
any conference, any summit,

10
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:37,003
any event that you have
people in your high level

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,371
from your organization going to,

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,140
and try to look at how you can

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,842
evaluate threats
associated with it.

14
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,113
What I want to get into,

15
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,681
I'll just cover a
little bit about,

16
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,884
a little background
about my organization.

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,219
A little background
about the G20 as well.

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,422
Talk about some of the
findings that I had

19
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,757
when going and trying to
evaluate the threats to it.

20
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,261
Walk through some of
the analysis that I did

21
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
after getting these findings,

22
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,965
and then some recommendations
and lessons learned.

23
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:09,402
If there is one theme
that I hope resonates

24
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,073
and kind of comes
through throughout
this talk, it is this,

25
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,341
and it's that,
while cyber threats

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,645
are very dynamic
and always changing,

27
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,747
our perceptions are not.

28
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,284
Our perceptions often end up
getting anchored and stuck

29
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,021
and as a result, it has
an impact on security.

30
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,390
So, standard disclaimer;

31
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,325
these views are
mine and mine alone,

32
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,027
and not that of
my organization's.

33
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,862
What that really means
is that, if I misspeak

34
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,429
it's all my fault
and not theirs.

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,665
And I could get fired.

36
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,900
Now, who's this guy
that might get fired?

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,737
I am, like Cal
said, my background

38
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,173
I've been working at the IMF
as a threat intel officer

39
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,576
for not quite the
last three years,

40
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,512
but have been doing
strategic cyber intel

41
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,415
for about that time,
and a little bit longer.

42
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,519
Prior to that, I was doing
military intelligence

43
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,424
in the US Army, doing
counter-insurgency,
counter-terrorism

44
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,329
type of work, a couple
of times in Afghanistan.

45
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,000
I feel like now is a good
time to talk about the IMF

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,336
and just give a
real quick overview.

47
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,339
I've found a lot of people
don't understand who the IMF is

48
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,574
and what the organization does.

49
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,843
You can see the mission
statement up there,

50
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,846
but broadly speaking, our
purpose and our mission

51
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,382
iS to monitor and promote
the health and welfare

52
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,084
of the global economy.

53
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,552
Very similar to the UN.

54
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,388
We're an international
organization and we've got

55
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,290
member nations from
all over the world.

56
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,528
Specifically speaking,
we've got 189 countries

57
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,863
that are members of the IMF.

58
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,098
And when I say 'countries
that are members,'

59
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,933
I mean that those
countries governments

60
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,636
are members of the
IMF, just like the UN.

61
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,638
There's only about four
countries that aren't.

62
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,642
We were birthed out of
the same conference,

63
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,277
The Bretton Woods
Conference IN 1945,

64
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,012
that birthed the World Bank,

65
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,080
however, we are
not the World Bank.

66
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,416
It's funny, my own
family confuses that.

67
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,751
They'll call up and
say, "Oh, how are things

68
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,685
"at the World Bank?"

69
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,786
It's like, "I don't know.

70
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,956
"Things at the IMF
are great, though."

71
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,724
You'd think after three years
it wouldn't be a problem

72
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,659
but it still is.

73
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,163
So part of our role,

74
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,065
and we work very closely
with the World Bank,

75
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,668
and the way that I
describe the difference is,

76
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,138
if you're Country X, and you
want to build a power plant,

77
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,273
if you want to do
some development,
you go and get a loan

78
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,775
from the World Bank.

79
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,277
If you're Country X and
you're having trouble

80
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,846
paying back a loan,
you go to the IMF.

81
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,417
We're often known as, 'The
Lender of Last Resort.'

82
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,786
We do a lot more than
just loaning money,

83
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,821
but that is what we're
probably most known for

84
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,855
at least in the news.

85
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,226
Because of our membership
and because of our role,

86
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,363
we have a very good look
at the world's economy.

87
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,933
We have a good idea of what's
happened, why it's happened

88
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,035
and a decent idea of
what's coming next

89
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,603
and what that means for markets.

90
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:02,342
What it also means is we make
a very useful intermediary,

91
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,211
interlocutor, I'm pretty
sure I said that wrong,

92
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,579
between different countries.

93
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,281
As a result, that's
one of the reasons why

94
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,882
we're a member of the G20.

95
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,820
So Rob just got done
giving an excellent talk

96
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,856
about intel preparation
in the cyber environment.

97
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,526
We actually underwent that
same exercise last year.

98
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,696
He talked about some of the
use cases for doing that,

99
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,299
well this is actually
one of the use cases.

100
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,700
When we went and we started
evaluating all the threats

101
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,938
that can come to
either IMF individuals

102
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,840
or organizations
by way of the IMF,

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,710
what we found is that,
we were actually exposed

104
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,415
to more threats by virtue of
our affiliation with the G20

105
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,184
than we were with our
other big meetings,

106
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,720
which are called the annual
meetings and the spring meetings

107
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,991
that we co-host, or co-do,
with the World Bank.

108
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,494
So that was really interesting.

109
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,928
That was something that people

110
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,131
in our organization
didn't expect.

111
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,500
And as a result,
got people thinking.

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,303
When I presented these findings,

113
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,406
one of the people that
I presented to was like,

114
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,141
"Hey, this is
really interesting.

115
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,077
"Did you know that the
G20 is more than just

116
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,380
"the Leaders Summit
that everyone reads
about in the news.

117
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,616
"There are actually
several working groups

118
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,919
"and ministerial meetings
that lead up to the G20.

119
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,256
"We send people to all those
meetings and working groups.

120
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,993
"Do those people incur the
same level of cyber risk

121
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,628
"by virtue of going to those,

122
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,130
"as the people that go to
this Leader Summit do?"

123
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,000
And I responded, like any
good intel person did,

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,435
"Well, I don't know.

125
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,503
"Let me get back to you."

126
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,240
So what I spent the next
couple months doing,

127
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,245
I got asked that question in
March, April of last year,

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,848
I spent the next few months
coming up with the answer.

129
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,318
Starting working on
a detailed analysis.

130
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,820
My methodology there was simple;

131
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,424
first, look internally,
then next, look externally.

132
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,325
Looking internally, I
tried to go and review

133
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,662
all the past
incidents that we had

134
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,897
that had any kind of
connection with the G20.

135
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,501
Then look at our telemetry as
far back as the data would go

136
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,270
and see any kind of threats
that we had caught or blocked

137
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,905
that had anything
to do with G20.

138
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,808
And then the last thing,
I script it down to just

139
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,177
the people that were
from our organization

140
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,848
that attended the G20
Summits or working groups

141
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,119
and looked, "Let's take a deeper
dive into stuff we caught.

142
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,588
"Is anything appearing more
targeted or more sophisticated

143
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,490
"that we might have
missed at first look."

144
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,258
And then I looked externally.

145
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,028
Now is a good time to go
and give a little background

146
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,198
about the G20 because when
I first got this question

147
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,534
I knew basically
nothing about the G20.

148
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,739
If I had to guess, I'm
probably not alone.

149
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,642
Sorry this isn't a pew cue map

150
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,877
I know that would have
been the only thing

151
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,512
that could have
made this better,

152
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,447
is if there was lights
and sounds flinging
across the stage.

153
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,652
But the G20, or "Group
of 20," represents

154
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,756
the top 19 nations and the EU,

155
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,258
'top' meaning top in landmass,

156
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,260
top in population size, and GDP.

157
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,763
And they come
together ever since

158
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,066
the financial crisis
erupted, about 2009,

159
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,102
to help solve big problems
and do it faster than

160
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,440
international bodies like
the UN or IMF can do.

161
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,609
IMF and UN and other
organizations like us

162
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,244
are very consensus driven,

163
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,647
and as a result we move
a little bit more slowly.

164
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,717
Organizations like the G20,
because they're smaller

165
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,753
they can move
forward more quickly.

166
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,823
Because of the leading nations,

167
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,792
what they decide to
do has a bigger impact

168
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,128
on a lot of other
nations' policy.

169
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,864
So you see there are 19
nations, plus the EU.

170
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,501
Guest countries
also come as well.

171
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,036
From a governing
standpoint, the way it works

172
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,738
- And this is kind
of important -

173
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,108
every country, every
member, rotates every year

174
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,810
being the presidents.

175
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,745
So whoever the president
of that country is,

176
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,280
is now the chairperson
for the G20.

177
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,349
Last year, Germany
was the president.

178
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,917
So Angela Merkel
was the president,

179
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,186
or chairperson of the G20.

180
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,621
Year before that, China.

181
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,655
Year before that, Turkey.

182
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,922
Year before that, Australia.

183
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,358
And so on and so forth.

184
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,460
What that also means is that,

185
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,695
not only is that
person the chair,

186
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,331
but their country
hosts the summit

187
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,866
and all those working groups.

188
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,133
So last year all the meetings
were being held in Deutschland

189
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,304
This year it's all going
to be in Argentina.

190
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,075
When you look at it,
there are two tracks

191
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,244
for all of these working groups.

192
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,345
There's about 12 working groups,

193
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,513
you can see them listed there,

194
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,780
and they're divided up between

195
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,183
a Financial Track
and a Leader Track.

196
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,717
Also known as the Sherpa Track.

197
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,219
Don't ask my why they call it
the Sherpa Track, it just is.

198
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,688
The way I think about it,

199
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,223
if I'm in the US Treasury,
I go the Finance Track.

200
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,560
If I'm in the State Department,
I go the Leader Track,

201
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,363
or the Sherpa Track.

202
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,233
The way that it works, all
of these working groups

203
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,169
get together and people
from all of the G20 nations

204
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,972
talk about problems going
on in that specific thing.

205
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,275
So whether it's agriculture
or anti-corruption,

206
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,644
talk about the big issues
that need to be addressed

207
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,014
and come up with
policy recommendations.

208
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,849
These individual working groups

209
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,783
will meet throughout the year

210
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,018
and then they propose something,

211
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,453
and that gets signed off
at the Leaders Summit

212
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,055
and all the leaders
sign on to this.

213
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,693
It ends up being
this communique.

214
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,461
It's how the Leaders
Summit concludes.

215
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,963
That part's actually
relevant for the next talk,

216
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,766
so just file that
away for later.

217
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,136
But it's this non-binding
resolution that says,

218
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,671
"We, the members of
the G20, say that

219
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,906
"this is something that's wrong

220
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,040
"and we're going to
do this about it."

221
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,075
Or, "we do approve of this."

222
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,543
Or, "we don't approve of that."

223
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,047
So that's actually, like I said,
that's important for later.

224
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,016
On the IT side, the
way that it works

225
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,086
if you are the nation
that's hosting it,

226
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,422
you're also setting up
the conference network

227
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,191
for all the G20 attendees.

228
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,293
It's actually not that
dissimilar from the network

229
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,828
that SANS has set up here.

230
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,632
Because, otherwise,
all the other nations

231
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,099
are basically just
doing all their work

232
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,035
within their own organizations,

233
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,072
and just emailing it back
and forth to everybody else.

234
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,341
One of the things that I
did even before I started

235
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,409
looking at all
the incident data,

236
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,412
I went and met with
some of the people

237
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,014
that attended the Summit.

238
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,515
Actually physically
from our organization

239
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,985
go to these summits,
go to these meetings,

240
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,588
and got to understand how
they actually operate.

241
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,956
What they do.

242
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,592
What some of the classification
of the information is.

243
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,194
What they're actually
talking about.

244
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,495
Some of the concerns they have,

245
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,397
vulnerabilities they've
identified, etc.

246
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,765
That was incredibly useful.

247
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,933
I'm so glad I did that,

248
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,237
and I'll talk a little
bit more about why later.

249
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,976
Now, when I came into this
exercise, and to a large extent

250
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,079
the baseline that we
did confirmed this,

251
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,715
was that, there's a lot of
hackers targeted the G20, right?

252
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,185
That is definitely the
thing that you will see

253
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,720
if you Google cyber
threats and G20.

254
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,857
There's just hackers galore.

255
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,058
You see all these articles,

256
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,361
"133,000 cyber attacks
hitting China."

257
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,797
It just seemed a bit
overwhelming, right?

258
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,700
Well, let's see what
the data actually says.

259
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,902
When I looked at
our incidents over

260
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,771
as long as I could
get incident data for,

261
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,707
I saw that we had
about five incidents

262
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,710
over the last several years
that were linked with the G20.

263
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,515
We had two in 2011, one
in 2013, and two in 2014.

264
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,883
Our threat baseline identified

265
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,618
the primary vectors
were phishing,

266
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,453
and then malicious
USB flash drives.

267
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,091
So we didn't see any
malicious USB flash drives,

268
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,393
but you can see here,
the incidents had

269
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,263
a lot of phishing themes
going along with it.

270
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,034
There was also a lot
of G20 themed phishing

271
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,136
that we blocked in 2015,

272
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,106
but when we looked
in our telemetry,

273
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,741
I didn't see anything in 2016,

274
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,876
and nothing up to
that point in 2017.

275
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,444
Which I thought was interesting.

276
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,581
It was like, "Oh, this doesn't
line up with what I thought."

277
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,051
When I looked for
USBs targeting our--

278
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,922
or malicious flash drives
related to the G20,

279
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,192
there was nothing
significant about

280
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,794
what we were catching
from the G20 attendees.

281
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,228
So all this was
kind of interesting.

282
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,697
I decided to go back and look,

283
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,166
and do some deeper
look at the incidents.

284
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,569
Try and do some
timeline analysis,

285
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,738
see when they lined
up with other events.

286
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,275
I didn't have the
specific working group
dates for back then

287
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,776
but I did have the
Leaders Summits,

288
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,413
so I just tried to correlate
when these incidents happened

289
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,116
with when the
Leaders Summits were,

290
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:34,553
whether it was before,
after, or in the middle.

291
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,356
What we found is it was a
little bit all over the place.

292
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,426
As I'm looking at it more,
it wasn't quite making sense

293
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,529
and it made me realize
that I'd missed something.

294
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,534
As I would ask here, "What
is the big assumption?"

295
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,037
The big assumption
that I had made

296
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,741
is that any incident that
had any mention of G20 in it,

297
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,612
any email that had any
mention of G20 in it,

298
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,414
regardless of who the
recipient of the email was,

299
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,883
whether it was in
the subject line,

300
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,451
or the sender, or the
body, or the attachment,

301
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,887
I thought it was connected.

302
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,320
That is a big assumption,

303
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,991
and I should have
identified that up front.

304
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,459
But I failed to do that,

305
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,294
and what that meant is that
it cost me a lot of time

306
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,162
in doing my analysis.

307
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,130
I now had to start over.

308
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,431
So when I started
realizing that,

309
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,667
I figured, let's scope this down

310
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:26,672
to just G20 attendee
recipients, and see what I get.

311
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,208
When I did that,
didn't get anything

312
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,442
different in our telemetry

313
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,845
but what I did get
from the incidents,

314
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,447
I saw that the
primary timing of it

315
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,850
was prior to the Leaders Summit.

316
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,252
So when I thought about it,
"Okay, that's interesting.

317
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,487
"Why could that be?"

318
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,827
Well, one of the classic
intel use-cases is,

319
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,230
if you have a leader
that's going to an event,

320
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,433
a meeting, or what have you,

321
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,537
you as an intel organization
want to help prep your boss

322
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,840
or your decision-making person,

323
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,774
with information
leading up to it.

324
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,776
You want to not only tell them,

325
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,210
"Hey, this is what
people are saying."

326
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,312
But you want to know
what they really say,

327
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,580
what they really think.

328
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,317
That is one hypothesis
that I have for this.

329
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:16,322
This was people trying to prep
attendees in advance for that

330
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,691
That's something
that I think needs

331
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,492
to be evaluated and
confirmed later.

332
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:24,262
Again, going back,
when I looked again

333
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,766
at the 2015 phishing
data that we had

334
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,137
it was all
false-positives, really.

335
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,208
Looking at them, I feel
like we tuned our rules

336
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,711
a little bit too high and
caught a bunch of stuff.

337
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,913
And, again, I think because
we had this perception

338
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,582
that G20 equaled cyber threat,

339
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,117
we were blocking a lot of stuff
that maybe we shouldn't have

340
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,555
Seeing that dip,
I was wondering,

341
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,992
"Is there really no
cyber threat anymore?

342
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,260
"This doesn't make any sense.

343
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,761
"This doesn't line up
with what I thought."

344
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,997
So I decided to take a
look again at the data

345
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,998
that we'd gotten from
outside of our organization.

346
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,235
Just review what O-Sense
and what other intel feeds

347
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,236
had to say about it.

348
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,439
So, you see this
is a timeline view,

349
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:11,843
and I've lined up when
the Leaders Summits are

350
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,912
and tried to correlate this.

351
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,680
The dots on the bottom represent

352
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,284
mentions of cyber
attack and the G20.

353
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,453
What I found is that there was

354
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,021
definitely stuff
going on in 2013,

355
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,190
stuff going on in 2014,

356
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,726
didn't really see
anything in 2015,

357
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,195
and then that article about
all hell breaking loose,

358
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,098
133,000-stuff happening in 2016.

359
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,301
This is actually a
pet peeve of mine.

360
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,803
And I'm going to go on a
little bit of a soapbox here

361
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,071
so I apologize.

362
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,808
When you see some absurd
number in cyber threats

363
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,276
or attacks or something,

364
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,810
I immediately discount it.

365
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,680
When you actually
read that article,

366
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,614
what it's saying
is that there were

367
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,420
133,000 WAF blocks in the
month for that network.

368
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,390
I'm sorry, if that is
the headline, there's
nothing going on

369
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,025
There are no hackers
targeting that thing,

370
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,459
or at least none
that's publicly known.

371
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,362
So I immediately
discounted that.

372
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,265
What this timeline is saying,

373
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,934
it lines up with what we
were seeing internally,

374
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,570
that there hasn't been
any notable, publicly-seen

375
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,274
cyber threats for
the G20 since 2014.

376
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,045
Again, this isn't
what I had expected.

377
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,247
This definitely didn't
line up with perception.

378
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,882
So why is that?

379
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,617
I started trying to
dive into it around 2015

380
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,587
to see what could be the reason

381
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,223
and when I did, I found
this tweet saying that

382
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,358
Russia backs the norm,

383
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,961
barring industrial
espionage at the G20.

384
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,364
I was like, "What the
heck does that mean?

385
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,832
"What is that all about?"

386
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,268
So, remember how
each Leaders Summit

387
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,137
ends with a communique.

388
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,171
I checked that for that year,

389
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,274
and what it said
on the 24th point,

390
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,444
is that no country
should conduct or support

391
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,880
ICT-enabled theft of
intellectual property,

392
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,281
including trade secrets

393
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,282
or other confidential
business information.

394
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,818
For those that aren't familiar,

395
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,720
ICT is the same thing as IT,

396
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,088
it's just the way
that Europeans say it.

397
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,723
It's Information
Communication Technology.

398
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,662
So basically, all the
nations there said,

399
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,265
"We don't agree with
stealing other people's

400
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:17,202
"trade secrets and using it
for industrial espionage."

401
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,905
That was in November of 2015.

402
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,008
One month later, President
Obama and President Xi met

403
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,543
and signed the deal
basically saying that

404
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,279
China and the US
wouldn't do that either

405
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,213
against each other.

406
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:33,385
Shortly thereafter, all of
us noticed a rapid decline

407
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,490
in Chinese-affiliated
APT hacking in the US.

408
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,027
So what does this mean?

409
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,431
Does this mean that all
cyber threats have gone away?

410
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,665
That we don't have
to worry about that?

411
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,201
At least in the
context of the G20?

412
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,370
I wasn't so sure.

413
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,306
I'm trying to better understand
this dip in activity.

414
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,276
So I went to do an ACH,

415
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,244
and I think the talks
that lead up to this

416
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,913
did a great job of
talking about ACH

417
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,449
because I actually echo every
sentiment that they said.

418
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,884
Both in that it does
take a lot of time,

419
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,853
it took me a long
time to do this,

420
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,255
but I found the
benefits of doing it

421
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,325
is it helped provide
structure and rigor

422
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,862
to my analysis and to
my thought process.

423
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:21,467
I had three hypotheses that I
was trying to evaluate here.

424
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:26,472
The first was, the attack
volume hasn't changed.

425
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,139
It stayed the same.

426
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,074
However, what has happened is

427
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,110
attackers are now more stealthy.

428
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,312
So it's still happening,
but we can't see it.

429
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,081
We're not detecting it well.

430
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,282
So that was hypothesis one.

431
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,585
The second hypothesis was that

432
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,521
the attackers have
either stopped attacking

433
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,289
or reduced their
volume to such a level

434
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,625
that it's basically
not being picked up.

435
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,261
That was hypothesis two.

436
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,896
Hypothesis three
is kind of similar,

437
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:55,901
is that they've shifted
from trying to get access

438
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,037
to a device, or an
agent, or a network,

439
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,572
and switched primarily
to man-in-the-middle

440
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,809
type attacks where they
can get information

441
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,110
without being detected.

442
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,215
Now, as I'm talking about this

443
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,550
and as I've been
thinking about this talk

444
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,452
I realized that I've made--

445
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,922
one of the problems
with these hypotheses

446
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,159
is that two and three aren't
actually mutually exclusive.

447
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,361
And so that would
have been more ideal.

448
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,562
Because you can actually
have two and three

449
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,363
both work together.

450
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,599
They can both happen
simultaneously.

451
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,070
For those that haven't done ACH

452
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,338
or aren't necessarily
familiar with it.

453
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,642
The goal is not to
prove a hypothesis,

454
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,811
but rather try and
disprove a hypothesis

455
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,080
and get to the
hypothesis that is

456
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,117
most consistent
with the evidence,

457
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,920
or at least, least
inconsistent with the evidence.

458
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,323
So the C means consistent, two
Cs means really consistent,

459
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,792
N means not consistent,
double N means

460
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,695
you're not even sure why
that hypothesis is there.

461
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,600
When I did that, I used
the Parc ACH software

462
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,702
which, for me, was
actually helpful.

463
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,837
It's easier than using
a spreadsheet at times.

464
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,072
The problem that I have with it

465
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,139
is that you can't
export your results.

466
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,308
So that part kind of sucks,

467
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,843
but in doing that, I found that

468
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,247
the increased stealth
was the least consistent

469
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,782
with the evidence that we had.

470
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,518
Whether it was internal
to us or external.

471
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:24,489
The other two were equally
inconsistent with the evidence.

472
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,193
So my conclusion there is
that adversaries had either

473
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,163
stopped attacking, or
switched techniques

474
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,365
so that they were listening.

475
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,103
Again, not necessarily
ground breaking,

476
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,839
but it helped me go through
and have some structure

477
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,506
for how I came to
that conclusion.

478
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,815
All right, so after
I did the analysis,

479
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,317
I was thinking, "All right,
can I just tell all the people

480
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,254
"who are attending, 'Leave
your burners at home.

481
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,322
"You can just keep
your weak passwords.

482
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,590
"Go out there and have fun.

483
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,024
"Don't worry about
weak security?"

484
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,460
I didn't feel comfortable
telling them that.

485
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,196
So I decided to go and
brainstorm all the different

486
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,899
threat scenarios that
a business traveler

487
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,369
or conference goer
has to worry about

488
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,169
and then come up with
recommendations for each.

489
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,905
So looking at the logical side,

490
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,407
I'm obviously worried
about all the bad things

491
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,975
that can come in to them,

492
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,312
whether its through
text message, email,

493
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,948
whether it's through a
website, social media.

494
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,719
I'm also worried about
things that could get stolen

495
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,488
as they go out.

496
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,592
So those man-in-the-middle
threat scenarios,

497
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,627
I'm concerned about those.

498
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,195
But I'm also not just
thinking on the logical side.

499
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,264
I'm also concerned about
on the physical side

500
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,931
where our people
might be plugging in

501
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,536
a malicious or infected
USB flash drive,

502
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,005
or connecting to
a rogue hotspot.

503
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,908
Since most conference-goers
do all their work

504
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,078
via either conference
WiFi, or hotel WiFi.

505
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,379
Or even worse, just Starbucks.

506
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,584
The other threat scenarios
that are specific to the G20

507
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,553
that I was concerned with are,

508
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,624
getting a device compromised
while crossing a border.

509
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,260
So border guards taking
any physical access,

510
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,695
putting something on a device.

511
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,197
And then also people
sneaking into hotel rooms

512
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,001
and planting something
on the device there.

513
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,904
Much harder to detect,
a lot more gain.

514
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,506
So I brought all those
up, put recommendations,

515
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,542
went and wrote a
long, formal report.

516
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,378
I mean, everybody's heard,
"Well, you better make sure

517
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,913
"the executive
summary reads well,

518
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,515
"because no one's going to
read the other 16 pages."

519
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,817
But somebody actually
read the report.

520
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,684
I was so shocked.

521
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,851
I was so happy.

522
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,520
I was literally running
a high for a week.

523
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,687
It was great.

524
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,391
They didn't take all
the recommendations,

525
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,493
but they took some,
so I was feeling good.

526
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,263
That was before the
event, the event happened,

527
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,933
so we were monitoring
throughout the event

528
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,669
and didn't notice anything
malicious happening

529
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,937
in connection with the G20,

530
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,839
so it's like, "Okay,
so far, so good."

531
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,942
When the conference was done,

532
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,380
I went and debriefed a
couple of the attendees

533
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,614
to get a better idea.

534
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,149
"Hey, listen, did you
notice anything bad,

535
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,017
"or anomalous or malicious?"

536
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,388
And they were like, "No,
all standard stuff."

537
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,457
So my conclusion there was,
hey, my assessment was right.

538
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,726
I was so happy.

539
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,828
I felt like I was
an intel success.

540
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,765
Then Turla.

541
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,367
And I was like, "Ah,
Proofpoint, why did you have to

542
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,435
"publish this?"

543
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,105
But I was actually, in
hindsight, really glad they did.

544
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,409
What happened here, after
the G20 Leaders Summit,

545
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:35,080
Proofpoint discovered a mal
doc that they linked with Turla

546
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,816
that dropped a backdoor for
anyone that would open up

547
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,118
this document and
enable the macro.

548
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,690
Initially I thought, "Oh,
my analysis was failed.

549
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,026
"This was clearly
the stealth one.

550
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,630
"The ACH was worthless,
why did I even bother?"

551
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,733
But then, as I started
diving into this more,

552
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,635
I found out some actually
really interesting things.

553
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,304
It kind of correlated with it.

554
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,374
So, one, they just
found the mal doc.

555
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,944
They never found any kind of
phishing emails that had this.

556
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,812
They never found any
watering hole website.

557
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,314
Nothing.

558
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,249
They don't even know who the
victims are, potentially.

559
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,651
Or even the intended victims.

560
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,153
It just says G20 and has a link

561
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,856
to an agenda for one
of the working groups.

562
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:22,260
So, going back to those
three hypothesis that I had,

563
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,429
this still kind of
fits into number two,

564
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,165
where the attack
point had been so low

565
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,868
that it really wasn't
being detected.

566
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,437
The other interesting
thing about this

567
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,706
is that this is the first
time that I had seen

568
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,176
any indication that
attackers were using

569
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:42,781
one of the working
groups that lead up to it

570
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:47,786
to target or get access
to one of their victims.

571
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,721
That was the first time.

572
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,122
All the rest of the time
it had been focusing

573
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,191
primarily on the
Leaders Summit itself.

574
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,261
I didn't find anything
targeting those working groups.

575
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:04,069
Lessons learned time,
before we go to questions.

576
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,638
So sustains and approves,
definitely recommend

577
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,274
using structured
analytic techniques.

578
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,141
What I found is that
it definitely forces us

579
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:16,147
to be more thorough and give
out better quality analysis.

580
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,352
Also highly recommend
interacting with
the business upfront

581
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,522
if your customer's
in the IT department,

582
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,956
go meet with them directly.

583
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,791
If your customer is
outside the IT department

584
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,293
go interact with them directly.

585
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,160
Sit down with them,
have a coffee with them

586
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,763
or lunch is even better,

587
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,064
and really try to understand
what they're doing

588
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,600
and what they're trying to do.

589
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,435
And also meet with them when
they come back and de-brief

590
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,537
because that's when
you can really confirm

591
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,705
whether the
recommendations you gave

592
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,641
were effective or if
you missed something.

593
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,244
Also, I worked really closely
with the intel vendors

594
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,112
that we've been partnered with,

595
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:52,083
and they helped do a
lot of the collection,

596
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,518
a lot of the analysis,

597
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,922
so that was definitely really,
really valuable for me.

598
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,056
I couldn't have
done it on my own,

599
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,358
so I strongly recommend
leveraging them.

600
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,861
From the improved side,
definitely recommend

601
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,498
starting the whole
process earlier.

602
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,766
Especially the data collection.

603
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,301
And try to maximize the
amount of time you have

604
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,902
to do the analysis.

605
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,472
Two months, I probably spent
a month and some change

606
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,274
doing all the data collection,

607
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,744
and then maybe a week or
so doing the analysis.

608
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,112
The whole paradigm
should have been flipped.

609
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,848
I should have spent about
a week doing collection

610
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,783
and then about a
month doing analysis.

611
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,686
That would have
been a lot better.

612
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,989
The other one, don't make the
rookie mistake that I did,

613
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,991
identify your
assumptions up front.

614
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,727
That's kind of an
Intel 101 thing.

615
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,230
The other thing, I'm
very short-staffed

616
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,933
when it comes to intel
analysts and people

617
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,735
so when I was doing the analysis

618
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,271
it was basically
just me doing the ACH

619
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,207
and I realized after the fact
that I had so many biases

620
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,309
that I'm throwing into this

621
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,744
and so many
preconceived notions.

622
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,111
And it would have
been a lot better

623
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,014
to have had others doing that.

624
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,818
We're all part of different
sharing communities.

625
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,419
My recommendation, what I'm
going to do next time is

626
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,956
identify a handful of people
that I feel comfortable

627
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,591
sharing my raw product
with, and saying

628
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,028
can you give some
critical feedback

629
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,298
and really check my analysis

630
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,867
or make sure I haven't
missed something.

631
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,668
Help me see what I'm missing.

632
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,870
See the holes there.

633
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,773
The other thing that I've found,

634
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,609
and this is a bit self-serving

635
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,678
since I've been doing stuff
more on the strategic side,

636
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:31,516
is that cyber attacks are not
a good predictive indicator

637
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,951
of future threat activity.

638
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:38,757
Kind of like what Carmen said
earlier, trends are past.

639
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:39,924
They are historic.

640
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,593
They are not good
evidence for the future.

641
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,795
If you want to be
more predictive

642
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,764
and start to understand
what the threat will be

643
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,666
for an event your
people are going to,

644
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,034
you've got to understand
the geopolitical situation.

645
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,070
You have to understand the
threat actors that are in it.

646
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,303
Kind of like what Ron
was talking about.

647
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,006
You have to know the
threat landscape.

648
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,710
And that is where strategic
intel comes in and adds value.

649
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,746
Because you can then try and
take not only what has happened

650
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,649
but what you expect to happen
based on reasonable evidence,

651
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,851
and then help your security
improve as a result of that.

652
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,489
Again, consider the
geopolitical situation.

653
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,992
Ultimately, what
that will help do is

654
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,960
change perceptions
so that they are

655
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,397
more in line with the data,
which is where they should be.

656
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,799
So with that, I will
leave you with a quote

657
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,333
from one of the IMF's founders.

658
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:26,071
"The difficulty lies not so
much in developing new ideas

659
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,106
"as in escaping from old ones."

660
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,607
Thank you very
much for your time.

661
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,378
(audience applause)

662
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,114
(dramatic music)
