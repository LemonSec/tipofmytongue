1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,400
thank you for the great introduction I

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,940
uh uh very much appreciate that

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,820
um well gosh it's it's great to be here

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,500
um it's good to see everybody it's good

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,180
to be seen and I know that there's a lot

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,279
of ways you could spend the next uh 45

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,140
minutes of your Monday but I appreciate

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,400
you spending at least a little bit of

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,740
your time today uh with me

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,260
so the uh the thing I'm going to be

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,320
talking about today is this idea of

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,219
deconstructing the analyst mindset so

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,880
um my my career pretty much has had a

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,760
through line of Education throughout it

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,420
um

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,860
I've been spent most of my career

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,000
working in and around the security

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,620
operations center both working in them

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,660
as an analyst leading them training

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,460
analysts within them and that's led me

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,920
to a place where really I spend most of

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,020
my time at this intersection between

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,140
security operations work and obviously

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,079
that involves threat intelligence and

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,120
education and cognitive psychology and

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,920
trying to understand how we think so we

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,619
can do our jobs better and you know that

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,380
is really based upon what I think is a

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,420
is a simple premise but also a

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,520
frustrating one and that's generally

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,820
this idea that well

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,600
what we do is is very very difficult

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,360
being an analyst is hard uh being an

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,340
analyst is damn hard

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,560
right and that doesn't really matter

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
even if you're certainly if you're new

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,100
to the field trying to learn this craft

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,920
and how to do it and how to do it well

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,119
it's sometimes feels like an

41
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,680
insurmountable task

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
uh and even if you're you're an expert

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,820
in the field you know one of the things

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,220
we know is that all the things that are

45
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,659
going on in our head that make it hard

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,340
for us to think hard for our brains to

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,020
work well a lot of them are present

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,280
within security analysis work you think

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,420
about it most of our inputs into

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,180
investigations are very vague and we're

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,280
supposed to collect new evidence over

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,619
time kind of simulate that into our view

53
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,180
and constantly update and refresh our

54
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,460
Viewpoint to reach a more accurate

55
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,079
conclusion but the thing we know from

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,060
psychology is that mindsets are very

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,120
quick to form but resistant to change

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,920
so that makes it difficult

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,099
when you add in this idea that we have

60
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,440
this very broad array of evidence that

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,379
we have to work with it's hard to be an

62
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,060
expert in all of it it's really even

63
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,440
hard to be a generalist in all of it and

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,760
it used to be just that we had the host

65
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,260
and the host artifacts to worry about

66
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,239
and now we have the network artifacts

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,459
and we have Cloud artifacts and we have

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,980
container artifacts and who knows what

69
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,720
we'll have three or four years from now

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
but it's continuing to grow so that

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,500
makes it even more difficult

72
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,019
added to that this idea that we're in a

73
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,640
state of what I would call cognitive

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,620
crisis in our field and that's you know

75
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,780
cyber security is still in its infancy

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,340
in a lot of ways it's had to grow up a

77
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,480
little bit fast

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,180
but we have a lot of different sources

79
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,560
of evidence but none that are quite

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,900
reliable most of us rely on things like

81
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,599
blogs and social media posts for a lot

82
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,680
of our intelligence and the things we're

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,540
learning and for backup and Source

84
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,459
documentation and those things are not

85
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,440
reliable and anybody can post them and

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,940
there's not a lot of peer review and we

87
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,260
don't know if they're always true and

88
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,360
maybe they're accurate at first but over

89
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,680
time they become less accurate and

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,060
nobody's going in and updating those

91
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,440
things there's not a lot of

92
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,659
accountability with software vendors and

93
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,159
people make the operating systems to

94
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,860
document things really really well

95
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,379
that again makes it challenging for us

96
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,659
to do our job I experienced this early

97
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,920
on in my career you know there are

98
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,360
certainly people who just kind of

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
gravitate towards analysis work and they

100
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,480
just kind of innately get it right they

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,220
just understand and they're able to do

102
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,720
that work really really well

103
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,099
I think those people are gosh they're

104
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,080
the worst

105
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,340
now they're those people are fine we

106
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,659
need those folks too I was just was not

107
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,860
one of them

108
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,480
um it took me a long time and I have

109
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,519
these kind of distinct memories of

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,500
sitting in front of a search bar and

111
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,299
just staring at it knowing that the

112
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,920
answer to all the questions I had was

113
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,959
behind that search bar I had all this

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,459
this mountain of data behind it and

115
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,599
whatever I needed to figure out was

116
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,459
there I just had to figure out the right

117
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,319
terms to put in the search bar the right

118
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,000
query to execute the right question to

119
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,640
ask to get my answer and figure out

120
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,260
what's going on

121
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,239
it's kind of a paralyzing thing right

122
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,500
maybe many of you have experienced this

123
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,700
you're staring at the search bar and you

124
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,780
feel like you're staring at it for hours

125
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,159
it's really maybe only been a few

126
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,180
minutes but you're staring at it and you

127
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,440
just you can't move you don't know what

128
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
to do next

129
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,858
it's damn hard

130
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,680
so what do we do well we simplify it

131
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,360
right

132
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,979
that's not as easy as it sounds and

133
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,300
that's kind of what I want to talk about

134
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,360
today is this process of of simplifying

135
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,400
analysis work and making it easier to

136
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
understand and specifically uh some of

137
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,080
the output of my research and doing that

138
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,280
very thing taking some of these

139
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,380
cognitive science principles applying

140
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,560
them to in that research to analysis

141
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,880
work and breaking it down and

142
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,139
understanding it and generating some

143
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,120
mental models that help us out and

144
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,180
whether you are an expert or a novice

145
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,740
someone Junior someone inexperiencing

146
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,000
the skill I think there's value here

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,320
because if you're inexperienced what we

148
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,419
can do is take these mental models that

149
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,940
are derived from expert practitioners

150
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,240
we can use those to skill up to level up

151
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,340
faster right to try to mimic that

152
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,820
expertise if you're already an expert

153
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,840
understanding these mental models gives

154
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,400
you the ability to communicate better

155
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,440
with your peers and also the people that

156
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
you are mentoring and trying to bring up

157
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,860
within the field so that's really the

158
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,780
goal is this sort of uh the sort of

159
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,100
simplification

160
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,660
in that way

161
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,620
that's what we're going to talk about

162
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,820
today we're going to talk about some

163
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,199
mental models we're going to talk about

164
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,699
some kind of Trends a couple of

165
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,880
interesting uh statistics and I'm going

166
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,199
to share a few those all from from kind

167
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,940
of my original research some of which is

168
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,259
is out there it's published maybe you've

169
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,000
seen it some of which uh is new that I'm

170
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
kind of sharing for the uh the first

171
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,020
time uh today

172
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,580
but before we do that I want to level

173
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,139
set on some terms that I think are

174
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,240
important now

175
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,039
in our field particularly I always tell

176
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,960
folks if you want to start a fight in

177
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,520
infosec just try to Define threat

178
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,860
hunting or cyber threat intelligence or

179
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,120
really about any term and I think a lot

180
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,100
of us think that as the field progresses

181
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,380
those kind of thoughts will go away and

182
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,840
the sad news is they probably won't even

183
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,940
well-established Fields if you go into a

184
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,979
room and try to define something people

185
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,020
will have varying thoughts uh if you

186
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,699
look at Psychology for instance and try

187
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,280
to define the term intelligence

188
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,780
depending on who you talk to you're

189
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,680
going to get eight or ten different

190
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
definitions depending on what they study

191
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,320
and what their level of abstraction is

192
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,820
so we have that too and the only

193
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,020
important thing academically is that

194
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,340
when we talk about these things we try

195
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,319
to Define them so for our purposes today

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,780
I want to define a couple of terms that

197
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,520
I think are important one of those I

198
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,380
mentioned already a lot is is term

199
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,660
analyst of which most of you are

200
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,759
probably analysts are certainly uh work

201
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,960
with them and that's really anyone who

202
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,460
interprets digital evidence to

203
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,220
investigate security events and there

204
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,720
are a lot of different a lot of

205
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
different types of analysts right we

206
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
have responders and examiners and an

207
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,620
Intel analysts and reverse Engineers all

208
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,500
these folks do analysis in some way they

209
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,740
embody or utilize this investigative

210
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,720
mindset and maybe you wear multiple hats

211
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,220
maybe you do multiple of these things

212
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,280
initially and at some point these all

213
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
specific job roles didn't exist and you

214
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,100
had one person who kind of did all of

215
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,360
them as well as systems Administration

216
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,220
and now we're specializing more which is

217
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,139
a great thing but brings with it added

218
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,460
complexity

219
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,020
now there are a lot of ways to to break

220
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,940
these things up and kind of divide them

221
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,800
I generally do that by where these roles

222
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,539
fit in within the kind of standard

223
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,639
investigative process the incident

224
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,280
response process and for me they kind of

225
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,020
Stack Up Like This

226
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,060
so we have responders obviously who are

227
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,199
kind of involved not just in

228
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
identification but in containment and

229
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
eradication whereas most everybody else

230
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,560
fits in somewhere within identification

231
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,120
now you'll notice I'm using two

232
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,620
different color schemes here the top

233
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,240
three roles or one color and the bottom

234
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,860
three are another role or another color

235
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,139
and that's because I kind of divide

236
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,940
these up by whether or not they

237
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,800
primarily focus on the investigation of

238
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,300
the incident itself

239
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,860
so the top three roles incident

240
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,479
responder forensic examiner and triage

241
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,340
analysts are primarily concerned with

242
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,900
this core work of doing the

243
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,580
investigation identifying what is going

244
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,680
on on the network if for compromises

245
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
occurred and to what extent it happened

246
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
the other roles perform investigations

247
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
but they're still in a little bit more

248
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,419
of a supporting role and they have some

249
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,039
other things they're doing along with

250
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,139
that so Intel analysts reverse engineers

251
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,120
and threat Hunters are critical to this

252
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,220
investigation response process but they

253
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,599
exist in more of a supporting role

254
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,400
nonetheless everything I'm going to talk

255
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,380
about today is going to be relevant to

256
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,860
really all of these types of roles

257
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,400
now analysts investigate things so well

258
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
what is an investigation I think that's

259
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,639
important to Define too and I really

260
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,400
think of that as the systematic inquiry

261
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,259
and examination of evidence to gain an

262
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,580
accurate perception of what's really

263
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,159
going on perception is the key word here

264
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,860
you see that I've highlighted that and

265
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,020
the reason is because perception and

266
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,020
reality are two different things

267
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,099
um that's maybe a little bit of an

268
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,480
abstract concept perception is really

269
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,980
just you know how we view the world

270
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,600
right we're using our senses we're

271
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,860
interpreting information through our

272
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,899
brains we are processing that through

273
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,240
the lens of our own experiences and

274
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,740
biases

275
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,120
and we perceive the world in different

276
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
ways two people can look at the same

277
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,240
thing whether it's evidence or anything

278
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
else and draw drastically different

279
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,440
conclusions from that thing

280
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,740
so perception is different from reality

281
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,120
and that's a little bit of a problem

282
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,700
because our job as analyst is to come to

283
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,019
an accurate perception of what reality

284
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,820
is we want our perception and our

285
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,040
reality to match and well the process of

286
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,140
going from perception to reality is that

287
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,660
specific thing right it is investigating

288
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,700
things from a psychology standpoint we

289
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,980
might call it cognition from an even

290
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,839
more simplistic sample we might call it

291
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,880
learning right we are learning about

292
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,279
events that happen so we can bridge the

293
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,839
gap from perception to reality and

294
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,660
that's also pretty hard

295
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,300
so these are the couple terms I want to

296
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,920
I want to focus on and what I want to do

297
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,380
is talk about a few key questions uh

298
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,300
about how analysts do their work and how

299
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,860
my research is kind of revealing some of

300
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,080
the things that are going on and the

301
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,540
first question is maybe the biggest here

302
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,980
and that's simply how do analysts

303
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,440
conduct investigations

304
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,820
um it's weird to see you know 10 years

305
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,500
of research boil down to a single

306
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,959
question like this

307
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,220
um and it's a difficult one to answer

308
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,720
because you think about if you watch a

309
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
skilled analyst watch someone who's

310
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,540
really good at this work

311
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,519
perform their work

312
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,779
well they're clicking a mouse and

313
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,980
they're typing keys and they're doing

314
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,540
things but that's not really where the

315
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,000
skill lies most of us can use a mouse

316
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,560
and use a keyboard and most of us can

317
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,300
click on a tool or open it but it's

318
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,920
really the decisions that are being made

319
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,459
as to when to use a tool and and why you

320
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,080
would use that tool not so much A lot of

321
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,959
times how you use that tool and you know

322
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,279
you can't necessarily observe those

323
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,540
decisions being made because it's a

324
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,860
skill performance but it's a skilled

325
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,800
performance of the Mind

326
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,779
so the other idea is you could ask

327
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,160
analysts how they do it ask these

328
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,660
experts how they do the thing they do so

329
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,760
well but well that's tricky too because

330
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,740
most analysts are not very good at

331
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,480
explaining how or why they do the things

332
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,860
they do they can be very skilled without

333
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,839
understanding how they are skilled or

334
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,120
what leads them to these decisions

335
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,680
and that's kind of a tricky thing most

336
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,660
of the knowledge that exists within our

337
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,579
field is pass it it's kind of Unwritten

338
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,740
it's not necessarily explicit

339
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,019
that's challenging it's very limiting

340
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,000
so what we end up doing here is

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
conducting research using kind of

342
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,500
formalized research methods from science

343
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,360
from cognitive psychology and other

344
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,800
fields of psychology and other areas as

345
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,240
well to study these sorts of things and

346
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,620
when I look at this question how do

347
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,240
analysts conduct investigations I know

348
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,940
that when analysts do these things they

349
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,740
are trying to you know do sense making

350
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,480
make sense of what they are seeing and

351
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,100
they have these core structural elements

352
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,079
that they're trying to arrange right we

353
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,279
have pieces of a puzzle and we're trying

354
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,680
to arrange those in the right way so the

355
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,000
thing we have to consider is what are

356
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,860
those elements first we would call this

357
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,180
structural knowledge what is the

358
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,519
structural knowledge that analysts rely

359
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,000
on to do their work so that's really the

360
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,740
kind of first thing we talk about here

361
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,680
and I examined this using a couple of

362
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,540
techniques uh one of those is by

363
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,040
interviewing analysts looking at the

364
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,779
terms they use trying to normalize those

365
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,100
because people use terms in a little bit

366
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,779
different ways and creating kind of

367
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,240
these semantic relationship graphs of

368
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,579
how the terms interact creating things

369
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,440
called Pathfinder networks which are

370
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,019
kind of like a directed graph database

371
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,480
want to think in that way and weighting

372
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,500
those things and understanding these

373
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,760
structural elements and when I do that

374
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,860
the results that are kind of revealed

375
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,000
here are something that I called The

376
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,160
Turk model Turk is an acronym it stands

377
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,839
for timeline event relationship and

378
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,700
characteristic and when analysts are

379
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,279
thinking about investigations moving

380
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,320
pieces around in their head these are

381
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,060
generally the pieces and it generally

382
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,800
starts with this mental model this

383
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,480
concept of a timeline

384
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,640
now most of us know what timelines are

385
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,740
right we have events that are relevant

386
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,120
to the investigation they have a start

387
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,500
they have an end they generally all have

388
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,720
time stamps of some sort and hopefully

389
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,100
those are all normalized to the correct

390
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,140
time zone or you're going to have a bad

391
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,880
time now

392
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,380
timeline is kind of at the top level and

393
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,260
we have this concept of events and

394
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,700
events are really used to describe

395
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,339
relationships which then have

396
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,079
characteristics that's the TVR the EVR

397
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
and the C

398
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,820
now in this case a relationship we we

399
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,139
know what most of those are right we

400
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,579
have a user logging into a device we

401
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,399
have a device executing a file we have a

402
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,019
device communicating with another device

403
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,420
these are all generally relationships

404
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,639
and events are things that more or less

405
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,980
describe the start of a relationship the

406
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,440
end of a relationship or a change in the

407
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,459
relationship

408
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,139
somehow that's generally what analysts

409
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,339
care about when they're doing these

410
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,600
investigations and all of these things

411
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,000
have characteristics the entities at

412
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,200
either end of the relationship have

413
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,700
characteristics and the relationship

414
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,480
itself has characteristics

415
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,600
so uh an example of this right this is a

416
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,660
who is record someone uh registered a

417
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,459
domain right that's something we might

418
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,959
be interested as Intel analysts someone

419
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,600
registering this particular uh domain so

420
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,920
here we have a person that registered a

421
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,540
domain we know what the domain is it's

422
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,620
right there maybe we don't know who the

423
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,000
person is but we know some details about

424
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
them so we have characteristics of those

425
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
things and of course the registration

426
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,639
itself has characteristics or properties

427
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,720
associated

428
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,240
with so again think of this almost like

429
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,740
represent represented by a graph

430
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,959
database that's slowed in around in our

431
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,339
head maybe a little bit more complex

432
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,839
with that but that's a simple uh and

433
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,180
effective way to think about that thing

434
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,339
so these are the components or the

435
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,899
pieces that we're moving around in our

436
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,220
head when we're trying to resolve an

437
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,480
investigation figure out what happened

438
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,000
and what the extent was

439
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,220
this leads us to the next part

440
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,380
we know what the pieces are so now we

441
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,600
have to talk about the process which is

442
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,740
use

443
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,200
to research this I performed what's

444
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,360
called a cognitive task analysis kind of

445
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,720
a collection of techniques wherein I

446
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,639
work with expert analysts and do a

447
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,160
couple things one is I ask them to

448
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
describe complex or difficult

449
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,820
investigations they've worked we walked

450
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,220
through it several times sometimes Ad

451
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,040
nauseam four or five uh times uh going

452
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,779
through the details steps of why they

453
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,100
chose to do what they did and why they

454
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,079
made the decisions that they made

455
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,540
uh the other part of this is I create

456
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,519
hypothetical scenarios which I pose to

457
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,920
analysts and they work through those

458
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,139
while explaining kind of thinking aloud

459
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,480
about what they're doing I give them

460
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,180
some kind of probing questions about uh

461
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,500
that kind of helps me find the things

462
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,839
that I want to find I record that we

463
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,880
convert it to text do some kind of

464
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,800
keyword mapping and looking for

465
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,320
relationships between different things

466
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,760
and kind of assimilating all that data

467
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
together

468
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,260
with that what I kind of reveal here is

469
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,760
this process that expert analysts use

470
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,040
for investigations so that process is

471
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,959
called Diagnostic in Greek

472
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,760
um I call that dink for short which my

473
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
fellow pickleball players will probably

474
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
uh appreciate but it's diagnostic

475
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,300
because the goal is to diagnose the

476
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,920
events that have occurred whether

477
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,660
they're malicious or been on and inquiry

478
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,279
because the mechanism we used to do that

479
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,500
is one of increase one of asking

480
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,240
questions

481
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,100
so let's talk about that process

482
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,139
now we start with a timeline that's kind

483
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,279
of this core mental model that we're

484
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,540
using there we're mapping things out to

485
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,639
in our head and we start with an initial

486
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,100
event all investigations generally begin

487
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,139
with some sort of initial event some

488
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,240
observation that can be from an IDs

489
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,820
alert it can be from a phone call from a

490
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,320
tip from the threat Intel team it can be

491
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,180
from uh really it doesn't really matter

492
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,100
really anything but that generally comes

493
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,260
with some form of initial evidence that

494
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,839
we have to work with and that's an event

495
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,579
which as we know represents the start

496
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,339
and or change of a relationship

497
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:12,720
since it comes with initial evidence

498
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,399
what we can do is interpret that

499
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,899
evidence and specifically as analysts we

500
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,480
interpret meaning and evidence

501
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,040
four or five analysts look at the same

502
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,300
evidence they can interpret different

503
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,740
meaning we're going to talk a little bit

504
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,779
more about that here in a bit but we

505
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:25,980
interpret the meaning and that evidence

506
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,240
so we try to understand what it's

507
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,459
telling us and what it kind of suggests

508
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,800
evidence comes with cues that suggest

509
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,899
other things that are relevant to our

510
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,600
interests perhaps other relationships

511
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,120
that are of interest and what that leads

512
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,579
us to do is form what is called an

513
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,740
investigative question

514
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,019
is a question we need to answer to move

515
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,459
the investigation

516
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,800
board some analysts do this a little bit

517
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,000
more consciously than others they're

518
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,259
aware that they're doing it especially

519
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,880
if they've been taught to do it

520
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,899
but a lot of us are doing it

521
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,759
subconsciously particularly good

522
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,980
analysts when they go into Data looking

523
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,660
for answers they are trying to answer a

524
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,880
specific question they're taking the

525
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,500
small slice of data possible that they

526
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,059
need to answer that question they're not

527
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,260
just going in and saying give me the

528
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,000
keycap and just digging through that

529
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,439
kind of all over the place they're being

530
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,640
a little bit more surgical a bit more

531
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,740
precise than that

532
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,119
so they're forming this investigative

533
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,199
question and then of course they're

534
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,839
going into evidence to answer it

535
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,660
when they do that the idea here is that

536
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,280
you're maybe going to find some other

537
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,980
relevant events that can be added to

538
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,299
your timeline

539
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,319
now

540
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,059
speaking and answer finding answer and

541
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,260
evidence gives you new evidence for

542
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,640
which you have to interpret the mean of

543
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,860
that evidence both by itself and when

544
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,600
within the context of other evidence you

545
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,919
already know about

546
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
and ultimately getting answers to

547
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,020
questions baguettes more questions

548
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,580
so this process repeats and you keep

549
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,980
kind of identifying more events as you

550
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,140
interpret meaning you form questions and

551
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,280
then you seek the answers to this

552
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,660
question until eventually and hopefully

553
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,299
you reveal all of the relevant events in

554
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,380
the timeline that have occurred so

555
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,179
either all the enough of the actions

556
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,620
that you've seen to decide that it's

557
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,460
benign activity or actions all related

558
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,840
to the malicious activity understanding

559
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,400
everything that's gone on from the

560
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,020
attacker's perspective that eventually

561
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,059
gets you to a conclusion

562
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,220
now this is kind of a simplified form of

563
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,660
this model there's a lot of more

564
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,460
specific skills and things going on here

565
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,720
we don't have time to talk about all of

566
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,919
them today but I'm going to dive in and

567
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,419
talk about a few more of them as we

568
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,760
think about some of these more important

569
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,740
questions we want to answer about how

570
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,580
analysts operate

571
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,860
now we know that analysts interpret

572
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,539
meaning here

573
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,600
within evidence within artifacts so how

574
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,799
to analyst find that meaning I think

575
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,120
that's important I think we need to

576
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,919
examine that a little bit more and

577
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,840
through the same cognitive task analysis

578
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,840
I discussed earlier we also revealed

579
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,820
some of some interesting facets of that

580
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,559
along with some other experimentation

581
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,240
and some observation about how analysts

582
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,100
interact with that evidence

583
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,960
now it's important to note as I said

584
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,460
earlier evidence is a broad and complex

585
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,740
domain there was a time when it was

586
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,900
probably reasonable for most analysts to

587
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,440
have a Mastery of evidence sources all

588
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
the ones that existed uh I think that

589
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,160
time has long passed I think most

590
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,080
analysts need to be a generalist among

591
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,520
most evidence sources and maybe only

592
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,080
specialize in one or two I think it's

593
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,640
pretty darn hard to specialize and

594
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,740
master all of them

595
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,240
um when we think about evidence I think

596
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,740
it's important to simplify it as well

597
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,080
and analysts generally tend to do this

598
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,460
and they do this kind of using the model

599
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,320
I've just I've got kind of displayed on

600
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,020
the screen here I call these Realms of

601
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,000
evidence and think about this kind of

602
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,860
analogous to like how doctors and

603
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,780
medical practitioners break down the

604
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,480
human body into systems no doctor can

605
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,059
really master or specialize all of the

606
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,140
different systems of the body so they

607
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,059
generally focus on a system they

608
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,440
understand that system in depth and they

609
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,820
understand the touch points of the

610
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,280
contact points with other systems so

611
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,200
they may understand the digestive system

612
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,700
maybe they've mastered that very well

613
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,760
and they don't know a lot about the

614
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,200
um their neurological system the

615
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,640
circulatory system but they know where

616
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,840
those things interface with the

617
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,340
digestive system

618
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,840
right so there's no in those interface

619
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,039
points and we kind of do the same thing

620
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,020
and let's do this all the time uh most

621
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,700
of us I think break down at a high level

622
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,160
evidence into host or network-based

623
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,780
evidence but really when you probe that

624
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,980
a little bit more you find that analysts

625
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,240
are breaking things down into a few more

626
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,100
categories and I think most of these uh

627
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,140
make sense application data is really

628
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,700
any type of log generated by an

629
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,840
application including the operating

630
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,280
system itself

631
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
um disk we're talking about files and

632
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,360
metadata associated with those files

633
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,340
Network things transmitted from one

634
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,799
computer to another uh memory so either

635
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,140
physical memory or virtual memory and

636
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,280
then we have the two forms the thread

637
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,260
two forms of intelligence

638
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,700
threat intelligence I think most of us

639
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,960
understand is intelligence about the

640
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,820
threats we Face adversaries things kind

641
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,440
of unknown through us are not fully

642
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
known to us and then there's friendly

643
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,380
intelligence so things often gets

644
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,520
forgotten but that's intelligence about

645
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,600
the things that we're supposed to be

646
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,559
protecting

647
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,539
so our users what is the role of the

648
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,940
user what do they do on our network uh

649
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,520
window what are their normal work hours

650
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,200
the system what is the role of this

651
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,419
system what software normally runs on it

652
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,460
when is it normally active where does it

653
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,900
sit in active directory things like that

654
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
friendly intelligence I would argue

655
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,380
equally if not more important than the

656
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,240
threat intelligence particularly when

657
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,280
you get down at the analyst level

658
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,620
so this is how analysts generally break

659
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,960
this down these kind of Realms of

660
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,460
evidence and when they look at the

661
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,780
evidence what analysts are trying to

662
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,960
identify are cues if you think about an

663
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,460
investigation we have a lot of decisions

664
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,260
we're making at any given time this is

665
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,120
another reason why analysts work is so

666
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,700
so hard we make a lot of decisions and

667
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,440
it's not just about dispositions of

668
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,179
things it's about every step we take an

669
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,679
investigation can take any number of

670
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,720
paths I also refer to it as the analyst

671
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,880
of the investigators Labyrinth right we

672
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,539
can take a lot of paths to a conclusion

673
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,740
more on

674
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,900
the opening moves we make uh within

675
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,120
those past later but we take a lot of

676
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,620
paths and the things that really Propel

677
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,740
us to take a particular path making the

678
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,840
decision are cues

679
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,880
accused a pretty simple concept it's

680
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
really any stimulus

681
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,039
that you know implicates an act or

682
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,140
action like it gets us to want to do

683
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,120
something right that's something we know

684
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,380
now is asking or forming an

685
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,580
investigative question that we're going

686
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,380
to try to answer and there are a lot of

687
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,200
cues uh types of cues that analysts were

688
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,340
leveraged I can't talk about them all

689
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,200
today but we'll talk about three that I

690
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,340
think are probably the most important

691
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,280
relational cues dispositional cues and

692
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,600
Novelty cues

693
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,640
now a relational queue is probably the

694
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,500
most common the most highly relevant to

695
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,179
analysts and relational cues are things

696
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,919
we find in evidence that when we see

697
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,080
them imply the existence of other

698
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,120
relationships that we do not fully

699
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,400
understand or comprehend

700
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,919
so for example maybe a little hard to

701
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,720
see but it is basically just a

702
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,400
screenshot of a prefetch entry that

703
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,700
indicates PS exec.exe ran on a system

704
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,780
now

705
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,000
try to tell folks we know that attackers

706
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,620
certainly use PS exec but we also know

707
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,360
that it's a legitimate application right

708
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,039
it's used by someone who wants to

709
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,900
remotely execute code on another system

710
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,940
and say that out loud you can see why an

711
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,260
attacker might be interested in using

712
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,820
that thing right particularly when it's

713
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,340
signed by Microsoft so

714
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,460
what we see here is we understand NPS

715
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,659
exec we know a couple of things happen

716
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,159
we see here from this prefix ensure we

717
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,380
know that it was executed on a system so

718
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,059
that's a relationship we already know

719
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,980
something about but there's also some

720
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,120
relationships that we have yet to

721
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,340
identify if it's used to run code on

722
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
another system run some type of file on

723
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,260
another system well what was that system

724
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,640
we don't know yet

725
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,140
and then

726
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,760
what was that code what was the thing

727
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,559
that it executed or attempted to execute

728
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,580
on the system

729
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,559
we don't know that either so these are

730
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,900
two relationships which we know probably

731
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,000
exists not 100 sure but there probably

732
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,080
exists we don't know if it was

733
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,340
successful or not

734
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,960
but we don't understand them yet so this

735
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,659
is a cue it's cueing us to take action

736
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,340
right these things imply questions the

737
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,140
question I'm now asking is

738
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,000
what was the host that was targeted on

739
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,500
the other end of this PS exec execution

740
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,960
and what did it did whoever ran this try

741
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,880
to run on it there are lots of other

742
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,740
questions that this would uh we would

743
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,260
kind of ask here but these are a start

744
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,200
that's a relational cue

745
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,760
the next type of queue is dispositional

746
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,380
most of us understand disposition we're

747
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,280
always trying to figure out if things

748
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,659
are malicious or benign this is

749
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:01,740
particularly relevant to folks who are

750
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,740
doing triage or type analysis and you

751
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,840
know sometimes we get cues that are very

752
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,280
definitive we immediately see this thing

753
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,780
we know know the whole sequence of

754
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,919
events is malicious and we know the

755
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,840
whole sequence of events has been on but

756
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,600
more so oftentimes we are kind of

757
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,400
constantly weighing what I call a

758
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,200
dispositional scale

759
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,299
we see something and that probably

760
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,740
weighs the events a little bit towards

761
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,900
liking and maybe being malicious a

762
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,240
little bit more towards being benign and

763
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,380
we're constantly letting that scale move

764
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,700
up and down until eventually we reach a

765
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,140
Tipping Point where we decided okay this

766
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,580
is definitely malicious or okay this has

767
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,080
definitely been on and that allows us to

768
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,960
either declare an incident or move on

769
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
dispositional cues are that sort of

770
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,380
thing

771
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,080
this is a screenshot of a packet capture

772
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,080
we see an HTTP get request here and

773
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,299
there are some things you see that well

774
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,159
depending on what your experience is may

775
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,460
end up being dispositional cues for you

776
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,440
the relationship here is we have a host

777
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,820
communicating with another host and I've

778
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,080
just made up some IP addresses here

779
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,539
again the endpoints of the relationship

780
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,980
and the relationship itself have

781
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,240
characteristics

782
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,220
we may see that the file that was

783
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,500
requested this

784
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,240
envjz2 that certainly looks weird just

785
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,679
on its own it doesn't have an extension

786
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,360
maybe you've seen that file pattern

787
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,620
before and you actually know what that

788
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,880
is and someone's about to have a really

789
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,900
bad day but that certainly is a cue of

790
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,400
some potentially malicious disposition

791
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,500
thing occurring we have that domain

792
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,600
there that certainly doesn't look like

793
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,279
it belongs to a legitimate organization

794
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,559
it's about top domain that's weird I

795
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,820
would say that's a

796
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,340
queue or a something indicating a

797
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,960
potentially malicious disposition and

798
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,520
then we look at the user agent and at

799
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,080
first glance that user agent looks like

800
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,700
it might be okay so we could say that's

801
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,919
a dispositional cue in the other way one

802
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,260
that maybe indicates a benign

803
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,460
disposition so we have this scale that

804
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,140
we're constantly adding to either side

805
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,480
malicious or benign the idea being that

806
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,580
if we can find enough events that we

807
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,799
think are malicious well we can kind of

808
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,240
dispose all of this activity as

809
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,860
malicious and start response as we see

810
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,419
fit while also probably continuing the

811
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,100
identification process

812
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,260
the dispositional cue

813
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,700
the last type I think is probably

814
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,200
easiest to understand it's a novelty

815
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,820
cube and a novelty queue is really

816
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,620
anything we we identify in an

817
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,299
investigation for which we do not fully

818
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,140
understand how it is or how it functions

819
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,220
so

820
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,100
here's um a Sandbox output of a command

821
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,740
being run icacls.exe

822
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,000
and let's say you've never seen that

823
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,740
command before if you've never seen it

824
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,820
before if you don't know what it is or

825
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,039
what it does that and the execution of

826
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,779
this or the observation of it being

827
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,279
executed by something else in a sandbox

828
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,440
becomes inherently a novelty Cube and

829
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,760
what it's cueing you to do what it's

830
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,140
spurring you to do is go research the

831
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,760
thing right maybe as simple as Googling

832
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,220
the thing for sure now maybe you know

833
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,320
what icacls study XC is maybe you don't

834
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,120
know what the command line arguments

835
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,380
that are being run what they do and why

836
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,059
they're being used in this way that in

837
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,340
itself is a novelty cue as well novelty

838
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,539
cqs can come in a lot of forms they can

839
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,980
be uh files that you don't understand

840
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,840
being run they can be domains that

841
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,460
you've never seen before they can also

842
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,260
be technology you've never encountered

843
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,179
so let's say you have an attacker or a

844
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,620
suspected attacker who maybe set up a

845
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,840
web shell on an IIs host on your network

846
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,400
but you've never really worked with IIs

847
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
before you don't really know how virtual

848
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,400
hosting works you don't know how an

849
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,600
attacker would have approached this or

850
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,820
got this set up well IIs and

851
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,200
understanding how it works and how an

852
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,880
attacker might attack it in this way

853
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,559
that becomes your novelty cue where

854
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,700
you're going out there and you're you're

855
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,200
Googling is maybe you're setting up

856
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
really quickly in a lab environment

857
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,620
you're trying to recreate some things

858
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,020
suppose you to take that sort of action

859
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,000
obviously when you're less experienced

860
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,679
you're going to encounter more novelty

861
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,720
cues in your investigations more things

862
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,919
you have to research but that's

863
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,299
something that never goes away even very

864
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,440
experienced analysts are constantly

865
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,460
encountering things that they've never

866
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,500
seen before because the domain is so

867
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,900
Broad and varied right that never really

868
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,039
goes away in that regard

869
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,940
now I want to add here that these cues

870
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,880
are not kind of uh exclusionary uh some

871
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,380
things some evidence that we find will

872
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,840
kind of overlap and represent multiple

873
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,120
types of cues going back to the example

874
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,740
I talked about earlier with PS exec

875
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,960
running on a host I already talked about

876
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
how that could be a relational queue and

877
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,200
the relationships that it represents

878
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,600
it can also be a dispositional cue

879
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,820
right one is that you see PS exactly

880
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,080
think okay that's a legitimate sign

881
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,520
binary

882
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,080
um that's okay so maybe it leads you

883
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,179
towards thinking it's it's benign but

884
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:10,260
you also have to consider the context

885
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,000
around the event in this case we see

886
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,820
it's uh it's running from the app data

887
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,860
local temp directory which is um for me

888
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,779
it's probably uh a dispositional cue

889
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,039
that something which is going on that's

890
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,840
not somewhere I would expect that to be

891
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,360
running from if it was intentional in

892
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,440
this regard

893
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,059
uh and also if you're able to see at

894
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,380
some point what's actually being run

895
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,640
that could Point You One Direction or

896
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,419
another

897
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,580
if you don't understand PS exec fully

898
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,860
that could represent a novelty cue as

899
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,360
well you understand exactly how it's run

900
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,679
what it works maybe what specific

901
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,659
command line extensions are being run

902
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,700
that's novelty so a single piece of

903
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,200
evidence can represent all three Q types

904
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,640
among others that we're not really

905
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,080
talking about here today

906
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,940
so when we interpret meaning and

907
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,140
evidence we try to understand what's

908
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,760
going on again we're doing that through

909
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,080
our own experience through our own

910
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,700
biases

911
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,020
um and we're trying to find things that

912
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,039
compel us to do other things we're

913
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,240
trying to find things that compel us to

914
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,279
ask investigative questions that kind of

915
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,679
represent questions there and answers

916
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,600
that we need to understand and also help

917
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
us prioritize those things dispositional

918
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,860
cues don't often inherently give us

919
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,600
questions that we want to ask but they

920
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,640
certainly help us set priority on how

921
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,320
far we want to pursue something whether

922
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,760
we want to keep chasing things down the

923
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,020
rabbit hole or whether it's time to pack

924
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,220
it up and move on to something else

925
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,380
which is also one of those things that

926
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,860
makes analysis work quite difficult

927
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,179
now

928
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,919
I think this leads us kind of into our

929
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,120
next question is we kind of know this

930
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,100
process that analysts use you know at

931
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,419
forming investigative questions and

932
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:31,980
seeking answers and things like that we

933
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,539
understand the domain evidence and how

934
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,220
it works so the next question is really

935
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,720
how to analysts decide what to do next

936
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,419
and I don't mean next at one given point

937
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,940
but really at any given point in an

938
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,260
investigation no matter where I'm in

939
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,779
investigation how do I decide what I

940
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,720
want to do next and that really relates

941
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
to this idea of investigative questions

942
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,679
my analysis monster the thing that I

943
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,240
think is maybe the most important words

944
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,740
that an analyst can remember is this

945
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,480
idea that a question well stated is a

946
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,980
problem have solved

947
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,020
if you can clearly identify the question

948
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,820
that you're trying to answer it allows

949
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,039
you to Target specific evidence it

950
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,240
allows you to take an incredibly small

951
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,919
slice of that evidence soon I've spent a

952
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,899
lot of time collecting Gathering parsing

953
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,179
all of it and it allows you to focus in

954
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,980
specifically on

955
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,320
whatever answer it is you need so a

956
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,580
question well state is a problem have

957
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,559
solved this relates to this idea of

958
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,940
investigative questions it's ultimately

959
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,679
as I've designed to hear an inquiry that

960
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,120
when answered helps an analysts identify

961
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,039
and understand what's going on and move

962
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,080
the investigation forward

963
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,580
now a couple of examples of

964
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,679
investigative questions which hosts on

965
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,059
my network have communicated with a

966
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,039
specific IP address

967
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,279
was the user here redirected to this

968
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,100
domain from another website or

969
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,080
did this workstation execute any

970
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,020
suspicious files after visiting a

971
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,640
specific domain

972
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,080
these are all pretty good investigative

973
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,700
questions because they meet what I found

974
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,980
are the three criteria for good

975
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,020
investigative questions they are

976
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,539
relevant to some existing piece of

977
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,559
evidence

978
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,299
right all questions should be relevant

979
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,500
to some evidence we already know about

980
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,260
they're specific they point to some

981
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,360
specific individualized evidence if you

982
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,799
give these questions to 10 analysts

983
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,760
they're probably going to go looking in

984
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,320
the same or at least a similar place to

985
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,059
answer it

986
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,860
and they're answerable they are actually

987
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,720
answerable given Common forms of digital

988
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,940
evidence that we would have available of

989
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,080
course answerable is going to be a bit

990
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,059
relevant uh or tied to your

991
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,860
organizations and what data sources you

992
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,720
have available but generally speaking a

993
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,620
lot of organizations are going to be

994
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,480
able to answer these investigative

995
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,860
questions

996
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,240
now

997
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,380
it's one thing to say that we should

998
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,820
form investigative questions but it's

999
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,320
another thing about how analysts do that

1000
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,480
and how they do it effectively and that

1001
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,620
really goes back to this idea of

1002
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,940
forecasting

1003
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,500
forecasting has a defined it here is

1004
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,580
when analysts interpret meaning from

1005
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,539
events which we've already talked about

1006
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,460
and they use it to predict other events

1007
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,039
that have occurred right so this is kind

1008
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,140
of a product a little bit of creativity

1009
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,640
but also experience and understanding

1010
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,500
likely timelines that exist remember

1011
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,480
when I say there's an attack timeline

1012
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,740
out there it's already out there the

1013
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,419
events have already happened we just

1014
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,919
have to find the evidence of them we

1015
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,600
have to think about places that we can

1016
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,799
do that interaction points where that

1017
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,940
might occur

1018
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,279
so we did this process of forecasting

1019
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,500
now for this example let's say we have

1020
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,240
an alert maybe it's from an IDs and it

1021
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,640
tells us that uh DNS a system on our

1022
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,580
Network resolved a bizarre C2 domain and

1023
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,600
when I say bizarre here I don't mean

1024
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,620
bizarre in that it's weird I mean

1025
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,840
bizarre is in the malware Bazaar which

1026
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,159
many of you are shaking your heads with

1027
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,140
yes and probably are having to deal with

1028
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,179
or maybe dealing with right now

1029
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,399
so we know a couple things from this we

1030
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,799
know this is the DNS resolution and we

1031
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,820
can start to think about do some

1032
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,440
forecasting and think about that if this

1033
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,640
event happened which we know it did we

1034
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,380
got an alert what are other events that

1035
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,200
could have happened if this wasn't deed

1036
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,460
successful and it wasn't malicious and

1037
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,200
something bad is going on or if it was

1038
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,179
benign we'll focus on the malicious side

1039
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,980
of things here and we can start to kind

1040
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,440
of do this forecasting one is we know a

1041
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,419
DNS resolution kind of implies that

1042
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:49,559
there was a connection made to the

1043
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,820
resolve.p we don't know that for sure

1044
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,799
but it's implied so that's one of the

1045
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,640
things that could have happened that

1046
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,620
host code connected to that malicious

1047
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,720
domain we know in this case that the

1048
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,340
host could have downloaded some kind of

1049
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,140
file right that's generally going to be

1050
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,240
evolved in some type of bizarre uh

1051
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,460
infection chain we know that that file

1052
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,720
may have been written to app data

1053
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,279
roaming if you do some research on

1054
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,179
bizarre you know that that's the

1055
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:10,320
directory that those files are often

1056
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,640
written to

1057
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,880
we know that maybe We examined Bazaar uh

1058
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,260
at one point and we know that it often

1059
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,539
uses ISO files as part of its infection

1060
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:19,919
chain and that those then get extracted

1061
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,120
so you know that that system would have

1062
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,860
somehow extracted that ISO whether it

1063
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,059
was through an automated process or a

1064
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,320
user clicking on something and doing it

1065
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,340
still

1066
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,500
we know this is file uh could have

1067
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,419
executed a dll that's something we see a

1068
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:31,620
lot with lots of threat actors but

1069
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,240
certainly with razar as well so we could

1070
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,120
see red server 32 executing uh opening a

1071
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,260
dll

1072
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,360
and we know that oftentimes there's some

1073
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,919
Auto Runner persistence mechanism

1074
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,360
involved so you know that that's

1075
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,100
something that could have happened too

1076
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,539
so when I say forecasting it's really

1077
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:46,799
just doing what I'm doing here it's just

1078
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,880
thinking about other events that could

1079
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,080
have occurred if this was indeed

1080
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,880
malicious

1081
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,919
now none of these events could have

1082
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,899
occurred which maybe that's a good thing

1083
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,519
all of them could have occurred which is

1084
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,019
certainly a bad thing but ultimately

1085
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:59,880
what we have to do here is pick one we

1086
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,260
have to pick one we want to pursue and

1087
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,700
turn that into an investigative question

1088
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,519
and you know there's some thoughts on

1089
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,080
how to pick the best one but what it

1090
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,580
really boils down to is is kind of best

1091
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,379
bang for your buck what is going to help

1092
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,300
you most quickly determine whether this

1093
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,820
event is malicious or not and how easy

1094
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,320
it is to go and collect the evidence and

1095
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,879
come to that disposition because our

1096
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,080
time is really valuable so you could

1097
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,280
pick any one of these I've chosen this

1098
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,260
one with the dll executing and this kind

1099
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,399
of naturally leads us to an

1100
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,980
investigative question that question was

1101
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,800
red server 32 used to launch any newly

1102
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,719
seen dlls just before this alert time

1103
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,219
and particularly on this individual

1104
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,839
system that we're looking at

1105
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,399
so again we're forecasting we're

1106
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,418
thinking about events that could have

1107
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,139
happened

1108
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,239
choosing one narrowing it on that

1109
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,560
forming our investigative question which

1110
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,820
then we go answer that question in

1111
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,399
evidence and the process continues

1112
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,960
now it's important to note here that you

1113
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,179
know I just listed like six things some

1114
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,320
analysts do that they go through and

1115
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,339
they think through all these different

1116
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,560
things that they might consider a lot of

1117
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,379
them don't particularly as they arrive

1118
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:56,639
at more expertise they kind of think of

1119
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,560
the first thing that comes to mind and

1120
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,420
then they just pursue that thing that's

1121
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,040
still forecasting it's still forecasting

1122
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,119
some particular event that might have

1123
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,260
occurred and they're going to seek out

1124
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,540
evidence of uh but just on kind of a

1125
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,520
smaller scale

1126
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,640
now I think that's kind of important

1127
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,140
because I think it relates a little bit

1128
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,940
to how analysts choose what to do first

1129
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,760
in an investigation and you might say

1130
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,900
you know I talked about how there's all

1131
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,160
these different investigative paths that

1132
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,020
we can pursue and you might say well

1133
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,339
does it really matter what we choose to

1134
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,079
do first as analysts if we get to the

1135
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,820
correct conclusion and

1136
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,160
well I thought I wondered that myself so

1137
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,480
I decided to do a little bit of research

1138
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,980
and try to understand that better and I

1139
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,660
I characterized this idea of an almost

1140
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,099
opening move kind of like an opening

1141
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,420
move in chess it's really the first

1142
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,520
query the first thing query you executed

1143
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,780
the first thing you go looking for when

1144
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,119
you start an investigation and so I did

1145
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,420
a little experiment here where I gave a

1146
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,640
group of analysts some input into an

1147
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,079
investigation a few different ones this

1148
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,880
is one of them it was mentioning that a

1149
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
user visited an exploit kit landing page

1150
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,700
and I gave them some data sources to

1151
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,839
investigate this thing in a little

1152
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,720
simulation tool I built and basically

1153
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,160
tracked their progress through the

1154
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,079
investigation so have them uh go through

1155
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,060
it attract what evidence sources they

1156
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,560
looked at how long they looked at them

1157
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,540
uh the sequence they took and how long

1158
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,800
it took them to arrive at the correct

1159
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,900
disposition and understanding of the

1160
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,820
alert identifying the attacker and the

1161
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,740
uh the victim and whether or not

1162
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,500
something malicious actually occurred

1163
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,520
there were a lot of data sources

1164
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,839
available but really given the initial

1165
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,859
evidence you have to work with there

1166
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,420
were only three that made sense to start

1167
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,820
with packet capture flow data or open

1168
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,079
source intelligence kind of a

1169
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,420
reputational information and we track

1170
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,980
this meantime to disposition and what I

1171
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,720
found out here was that where people

1172
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,060
started really did make quite a bit of

1173
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,260
difference in how long it took them to

1174
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,820
get to a resolution

1175
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,800
so here you see that folks started with

1176
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,780
PCAT took significantly longer to get to

1177
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,400
the correct this position

1178
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,200
than everyone else

1179
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,980
so certainly at least from an Evidence

1180
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,260
evidentiary standpoint it it matters

1181
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,060
where you start all these people looked

1182
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,680
at pcap they all got there eventually

1183
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,839
but by starting there first it slowed

1184
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,640
them down it took a lot longer it took a

1185
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,500
lot longer to make sense of what was

1186
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,000
going on

1187
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
quick side note on this one by the way

1188
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,000
we did uh there's two groups in this

1189
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,320
experiment we had another group where we

1190
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,700
had the exact same sources of evidence

1191
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,859
but we took out the pcap data and

1192
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,780
replaced it with at the time what was

1193
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,240
bro data now bro was called Zeke kind of

1194
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,940
a filter down more focused version of

1195
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,339
packet capture information when I did

1196
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,040
that the time's kind of normalized a

1197
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,720
fair bit

1198
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,500
foreign

1199
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,780
that's all to say that uh

1200
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,000
the verbosity of our data matters a lot

1201
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,960
too and I'll talk about taking the

1202
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,240
smallest slice of data possible it

1203
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,339
really really does affect how much time

1204
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,680
we spend looking at looking at things

1205
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,240
wading through data we don't need to

1206
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,099
deal with and this is normalized for the

1207
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,540
actual time it takes to pull in and

1208
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,339
parse the data opening up Wireshark or

1209
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,440
filtering it with TCP dump this is after

1210
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,000
all that stuff this is kind of cognitive

1211
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,260
processing time thinking about the

1212
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,339
things

1213
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,839
so there's a there's a difference I

1214
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,820
always say it doesn't matter where we

1215
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,859
start

1216
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,079
now most of you have probably heard of

1217
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,780
this idea of thinking fast and slow two

1218
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,420
Factor thinking too system thinking and

1219
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,500
if you haven't but it's basically the

1220
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,440
concept that most folks generally

1221
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,599
um well all folks generally think in one

1222
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,640
of two ways at different times right

1223
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,380
intuitive thinking is this idea of our

1224
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,359
fast unconscious thought that's kind of

1225
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,060
automatic without trying this is a way

1226
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,020
we think and the other is more

1227
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,160
deliberate we're actually using our

1228
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,780
working memory focusing on things

1229
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,940
something has our attention if I ask you

1230
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,400
what uh 13 plus 5 is you're probably

1231
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,540
going to give me the answer intuitively

1232
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,980
without thinking about it if I ask you

1233
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,660
what 13 times 5 is you're probably gonna

1234
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,520
have to think about it for a second it's

1235
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,920
more intuitive if you know me personally

1236
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,599
and I've seen me a lot when you see my

1237
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,800
face you're going to intuitively know

1238
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,720
who that's Chris if you maybe saw me

1239
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,460
give a talk five years ago and don't

1240
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,839
remember it and you see me you're going

1241
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:43,920
to be like where have I seen that guy

1242
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
and you're trying to think about you

1243
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,500
know different places you've been in

1244
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,700
your life and put two and two together

1245
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,900
and you're in you know kind of

1246
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,220
deliberately thinking about that sort of

1247
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,880
thing

1248
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,400
we use both of these in investigations

1249
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,599
one of the things I sought to better

1250
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,140
understand was how analysts use them

1251
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,760
within their work and so I did an

1252
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,520
experiment here wherein once again I

1253
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,780
took a group of analysts and gave them

1254
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,700
an investigation prompt

1255
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,140
and

1256
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,579
basically asked them how would you

1257
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,839
investigate this what would you do to

1258
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,700
investigate this and I wanted to know

1259
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,200
kind of multiple things like give me you

1260
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,460
know as many things as you can think of

1261
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,680
that you would use to investigate this

1262
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,180
particular alert and what we ended up

1263
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,260
doing with these analysts was

1264
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,880
effectively making a list they had a

1265
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,140
list of things and ways they would go

1266
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,359
about investigating this alert and the

1267
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,680
list was numbered so I know the order in

1268
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,200
which they gave them to me and when they

1269
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,820
gave me the list I evaluated it I kind

1270
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,500
of ranked the actions they were going to

1271
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,480
take there were low quality responses

1272
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,920
things that probably weren't going to be

1273
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,480
too effective or a really good place to

1274
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,859
start here and there were high quality

1275
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,300
responses which were really great places

1276
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,540
to start focused useful things of that

1277
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,560
nature

1278
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,960
and so what I've found here is that

1279
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,520
generally and this is across all

1280
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,040
expertise levels at this point analysts

1281
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,440
generally started with intuitive thought

1282
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,180
but eventually got to deliberate thought

1283
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,280
so you have this list and it may be you

1284
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,680
know 10 15 20 25 items long the first

1285
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,240
several items would be intuitive really

1286
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,099
quick right off the bat fast

1287
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,320
and then once the analyst exhausted

1288
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,700
those thoughts

1289
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,140
they moved into the more deliberate

1290
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,339
things that you know the time it took

1291
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,540
for them to come up with the responses

1292
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,599
extended quite a bit

1293
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,040
so

1294
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,540
I thought that was interesting not too

1295
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,800
surprising at this point but one of the

1296
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,060
things I started doing now was looking

1297
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,040
at the high quality versus the low

1298
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,960
quality responses and where they existed

1299
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,119
on the list and one of my thoughts

1300
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,859
though as well

1301
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,480
analysts when they come up with their

1302
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,619
first response the first thing that

1303
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,060
intuitively comes to them there's

1304
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,200
probably a good chance that that's going

1305
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,579
to be a high quality thing that's going

1306
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:33,720
to be something that they would want to

1307
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,040
pursue and

1308
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,000
oh I was I was completely wrong uh uh of

1309
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,980
those responses only about 10 percent of

1310
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,300
the responses they almost first

1311
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,619
responses they come up with were

1312
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,480
actually high quality responses

1313
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,280
things are actually worth pursuing they

1314
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,020
were a good use of their time to focus

1315
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,060
on and pursue in these particular

1316
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,400
investigations

1317
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,079
that was kind of neat

1318
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,480
furthermore what I found was that of the

1319
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,700
high quality responses the analysts had

1320
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,260
in their list

1321
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,480
most of them were in the later half of

1322
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,619
the list

1323
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,599
where where in their list people got to

1324
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,160
in regards to their deliberate thought

1325
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,720
varied but certainly by the last half of

1326
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,820
the list most folks were into the more

1327
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,800
deliberate thought and most of the good

1328
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,119
responses were actually found in the

1329
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,640
last half of this list so you know what

1330
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,500
we find here is that across experience

1331
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,940
levels

1332
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,920
analysts generally start how they start

1333
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,300
an investigation it's generally

1334
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,560
intuitively

1335
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,480
that's what they generally do but that's

1336
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,220
probably not what they should do

1337
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,359
now the thing you're probably thinking

1338
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,619
here is what about when we just prefer

1339
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,300
expertise

1340
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,619
um and what I found out here when you do

1341
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:35,940
it just for expertise is the numbers get

1342
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,140
a little bit more favorable but not

1343
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,940
nearly as much as you would hope like

1344
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,260
we're talking a couple of percentage

1345
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,280
points

1346
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,800
so experts are more likely in some cases

1347
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,880
to rely on their intuition because

1348
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,260
they're more confident they feel as

1349
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,940
though they have more experience that

1350
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,099
they can absolutely rely on

1351
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,260
but they probably shouldn't either

1352
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,720
intuitive thought has a lot of uses in

1353
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,859
our life and a lot of reasons even

1354
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,119
within analysis work there's some places

1355
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,920
where intuition really matters and we're

1356
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,780
often caught saying things like I want

1357
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,520
to trust my gut

1358
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,859
but we probably shouldn't deliberate

1359
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,480
thought is is kind of the pathway to

1360
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,240
success here through my observations and

1361
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,119
through the things that I've seen

1362
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,760
remember most analysts first thought is

1363
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,260
not their best thought

1364
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,000
and as they get later into their into

1365
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,140
their list later into their thoughts

1366
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,220
that they when they sit down and think

1367
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,480
about what they actually want to pursue

1368
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,099
an investigation is when they think

1369
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:24,420
about it bring it to their their

1370
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,339
attention uh place it within their

1371
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,900
working memory and manipulating these

1372
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,480
objects around that they find the thing

1373
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,119
that is really worth pursuing

1374
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,560
now what I'm asking you to do here when

1375
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,940
you do analysis work is to slow down

1376
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,380
nobody likes to be told to slow down but

1377
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,420
when we slow down we generally are more

1378
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,700
efficient better and more accurate in a

1379
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,740
lot of ways calmness deliberacy

1380
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,640
generally wins the day and Analysis work

1381
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,920
so we're getting close to wrapping up

1382
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,480
here and I've talked about a lot of

1383
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,920
research a lot of mental models and I

1384
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,119
just thought I would cast them up with

1385
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:56,280
uh you know just like how you can use

1386
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,839
some of this to level up just a couple

1387
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,980
of points that I think are valuable

1388
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,960
whether you're an expert or you're kind

1389
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,520
of new to this field I know we have a

1390
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,920
large array of experience here

1391
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,440
the first thing I would say is that you

1392
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,180
should take some time to deliberately

1393
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,680
think about the questions that you're

1394
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,000
trying to answer at any given point in

1395
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,440
an investigation

1396
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,060
whether this is in the threat Intel

1397
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,339
space or in the triage space or the

1398
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,319
incident response space anytime you jump

1399
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:21,240
into Data anytime you jump into evidence

1400
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,099
I want you to pause and think what

1401
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,839
question am I trying to answer

1402
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,339
that will be more difficult than you

1403
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,839
think it is at first but the more you do

1404
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:28,619
it particularly when you have the

1405
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,359
opportunity to get feedback on it

1406
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,300
the better you're going to be at it

1407
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,760
next I mentioned that evidence domain is

1408
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,780
Broad

1409
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,280
but we're no longer living in a world

1410
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,420
where you can only focus on network

1411
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,800
evidence or only focused on host

1412
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,940
evidence and really be able to

1413
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,680
effectively understand all the events

1414
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,180
that are going on in a network process

1415
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,560
that for threat intelligence share that

1416
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,119
with your end consumer you need to have

1417
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,200
a diverse array of understanding

1418
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,300
evidence so take some time to do that

1419
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,740
and really one of the best ways to do

1420
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,119
that kind of feeds into my third Point

1421
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:55,200
here which is to take time for

1422
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
deliberate practice

1423
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,560
many of you have heard the idea that it

1424
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,540
takes 10 000 hours to become an expert

1425
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,180
in something and that's a little bit of

1426
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,339
a an oversimplification of some research

1427
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,859
done by Anders Erickson who's uh

1428
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:09,420
um how thought it was the expert on

1429
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,339
Experts and expertise with within

1430
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,619
psychology and it wasn't so much that

1431
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,380
experts spend more time practicing they

1432
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,000
do but it was really that experts spend

1433
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,400
more time performing high quality

1434
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,839
practice

1435
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,099
what does it mean to have high quality

1436
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,300
practice well it means one you're

1437
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,440
deliberately trying to get better every

1438
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,400
time you do something you're trying to

1439
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,420
get better at doing that thing you're

1440
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,280
focusing on it you're also seeking out

1441
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,800
feedback for that thing whether it's

1442
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,060
some automatic system that's giving you

1443
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,099
feedback or whether it's more ideally a

1444
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,960
coach or a mentor or a peer someone else

1445
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,119
in your field or in your work

1446
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,099
feedback really makes a difference here

1447
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:42,599
so deliberate practice is really built

1448
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,940
upon this idea of feedback and someone

1449
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,859
reminding you to go in and identify the

1450
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:47,640
questions you're trying to answer

1451
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,140
someone who's critiquing your questions

1452
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,819
to make sure that they are specific

1453
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:52,619
relevant and answerable

1454
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:53,760
those things really make a difference

1455
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,000
it's about the quality of your practice

1456
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,940
now as we wrap up here I just want to

1457
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,740
share a quote that I think it's kind of

1458
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,420
a guiding principle for me the thing

1459
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,619
we're talking about here today we talk

1460
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,060
about learning about learning and

1461
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,140
thinking about thinking the term is

1462
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,880
really metacognition that's the fancy

1463
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,020
term we're describing here and the thing

1464
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,220
we know from lots and lots of research

1465
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,560
is that practitioners across many fields

1466
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,020
cognitively complex fields are much

1467
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,180
better at their jobs both learning how

1468
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,440
to do their jobs and executing their

1469
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,780
jobs when they are more metacognitively

1470
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,040
aware when they understand how they

1471
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,460
think they can better apply that and

1472
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,619
regulate their actions understand what

1473
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,440
they're doing be more efficient

1474
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,780
so this quotes attributed to Carl you

1475
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,000
who's a psychologist

1476
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,560
um turns out he didn't actually say the

1477
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,300
quote when you do some research on it

1478
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,980
nobody knows who did so I don't have a

1479
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,599
great attribution but the code says

1480
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,339
basically that until you make the

1481
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:45,540
unconscious conscious it will direct

1482
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,880
your life then you will call it

1483
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,920
what we do in intelligence and security

1484
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,920
analysis as analysts it's not art

1485
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,920
but we can bring Creative Solutions to

1486
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,380
it and use our creativity to resolve the

1487
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,000
conflicts that we're working through

1488
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,980
what we do in security analysis is not

1489
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,500
science although we can use scientific

1490
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,060
methods and principles of inquiry to

1491
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,500
understand how we do it and get better

1492
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,140
at it and level up faster

1493
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,180
what we do is probably more akin to

1494
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,280
engineering it's known quantities that

1495
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,420
we're trying to move around and arrange

1496
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,560
in the right ways so that they make

1497
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,240
sense and that may make what we do sound

1498
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,740
a little less exciting that it's not

1499
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,599
necessarily art or science but I find

1500
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,940
that to be a most empowering thing

1501
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,560
I think about you know when I first

1502
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,880
started sitting in front of that search

1503
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,920
bar being paralyzed and not knowing what

1504
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,900
to do next

1505
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,060
and then I think now and I realize that

1506
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,859
really the only thing standing between

1507
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,980
me and the answer I'm trying to get to

1508
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,020
is my ability to ask the right question

1509
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,180
and then to grab the evidence look at

1510
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,500
the evidence examine and understand the

1511
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,119
evidence that allows me to answer that

1512
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,260
question

1513
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,760
the only thing standing between all of

1514
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,540
you

1515
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,359
and helping people protecting your

1516
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,560
Networks

1517
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,079
saving human lives in some cases

1518
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,460
keeping people from taking things that

1519
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,079
don't belong to them the only thing

1520
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,240
stand between all you and that is asking

1521
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,280
the right question and then being able

1522
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,240
to gather interpret analyze assess the

1523
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
evidence

1524
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,740
that allows you to get to the answer

1525
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,660
until you make the unconscious conscious

1526
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,280
it will direct your life then you will

1527
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,599
call it fate

1528
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,940
what we do is far far too important to

1529
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,020
be left up to date

1530
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,520
that will bring us to the end

1531
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,040
now oh no no no no not yet not yet not

1532
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,520
yet not yet

1533
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,260
um so I'm wrapped up here I'm not going

1534
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,099
to take questions up here because

1535
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,180
honestly I think most of the questions

1536
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,700
that would be asked require

1537
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,560
more discussion than I could have on

1538
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,940
stage and y'all there and the lights are

1539
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,260
bright I can't even see you anyway so

1540
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm here for the rest of the day and

1541
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,220
tomorrow as well um I'll be around and

1542
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,599
at the rural technology fund booths out

1543
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,220
there um so if you have questions you

1544
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,599
want to talk please please come up I'd

1545
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,460
love I love talking about this stuff uh

1546
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,380
I can talk about it for for hours so I'm

1547
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,880
glad to do that

1548
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,140
um the last thing I'll mention here is

1549
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,119
on the slide um that link right there

1550
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,619
Chris sanders.org links have some things

1551
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:00,180
for you there

1552
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,339
um that includes links to my blog and

1553
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,260
lots of research um you can really nerd

1554
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,339
out on that stuff in a lot of different

1555
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:06,839
ways I didn't talk a lot about methods

1556
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,280
here there's like a 200 page paper where

1557
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,540
I describe some of the cognitive task

1558
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,800
analysis I've done you can dig it on

1559
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,760
that

1560
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,040
um there's links to courses I teach

1561
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,599
which is where a lot of this stuff

1562
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,859
manifests I teach of course called

1563
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,780
investigation Theory the analyst mindset

1564
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,720
where I teach people how to be analysts

1565
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,700
that also funds all of this research and

1566
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,839
keeps it going

1567
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:25,980
um and the last thing is it links to my

1568
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,940
social media I want to mention that

1569
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,960
specifically because every Tuesday

1570
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,880
something I do is post an investigation

1571
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,980
scenario I see a lot of you not in your

1572
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,079
head I see people who regularly reply to

1573
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,240
those things it's a really great way to

1574
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,440
um kind of do that deliberate practice

1575
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,240
type deal so think about to understand

1576
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,560
why you're doing something what

1577
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,880
questions you're trying to answer so you

1578
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,859
can post reply to those I do that across

1579
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:45,960
Twitter and Mastodon and Linkedin and I

1580
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,280
even make Tick Tock videos now I don't

1581
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,480
dance in them you don't have to see that

1582
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,700
but uh there are videos where you can do

1583
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,560
that so I post those every Tuesday every

1584
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,060
Friday I post some concluding thoughts

1585
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,500
it's a great way to engage I'm going to

1586
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,700
post a new one tomorrow and it is

1587
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,680
uniquely tied to something I talked

1588
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,260
about today in my presentation so be

1589
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,359
sure to check that out and that's it for

1590
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,859
