1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,019
extend a really warm welcome to my talk

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,880
on the way to a stakeholders heart

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,740
measuring the success of your ctar

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,440
program from a basically really cold and

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,720
dark evening here in Oslo Norway which

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,760
is way way up north in Europe if you're

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,859
not familiar with it is

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,840
um I am really really bummed that I

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,060
can't be with you physically

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,119
um in the US but you know I'm basically

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,800
looking forward to engaging with you in

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,660
the chat after I'm done so so we'll

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,739
we'll just kick it off here

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,420
um so my name is Freddie mercad I'm the

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,640
senior threat intelligence Analyst at

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,840
What's called the Nordic Financial

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,180
search and that's a non-profit

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,700
organization in Norway which covers five

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,340
countries in the Nordic region uh before

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,620
that I worked as an intelligence officer

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,719
in the Norwegian Army and currently I'm

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
preparing to start my PhD and I'm going

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,100
to research the cross-section of

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,280
intelligence as a program and CTI cyber

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,440
threat intelligence and you'll basically

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,119
see this through my talk today and what

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm going to talk about so the PHD I'll

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,159
start in April a little fun fact about

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,119
me I I like to play with dolls

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,939
and I guess I quickly have to just show

32
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,439
you what I'm talking about and that's

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,299
that beautiful thing you can see behind

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,159
me but it's also on the on the

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,200
presentation right now I collect Star

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
Wars uh Action Figures it's not dolls

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,400
you know if I want to be really correct

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,880
on that one

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,380
um I I just want to do one thing and

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,020
that's basically in the resource uh tab

41
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,680
or a resource Channel I just put in uh

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,659
some links and the first one is to my

43
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,640
GitHub and that's the uh github.com

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,500
uh I would highly recommend you go there

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,420
or go to the chat uh the the stock

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,520
Channel where you can find the link and

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
Resource as well there are basically

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,079
saying you should go there download the

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
PDF which is on the Mind map side

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
because you're gonna need it in a couple

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,780
of minutes when I'll go through those

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,600
details so the rest of the agenda

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,758
basically are three things I'm gonna

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,739
talk about definitions because words

55
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,319
matter uh so you know that's a plug to

56
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,660
you Lillian and also uh we're gonna talk

57
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,700
a little bit about a problem and that's

58
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,739
some metrics and how to measure well and

59
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,260
show value to our stakeholders and the

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,360
third part is basically the solution

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
where I'm going to use the intelligence

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,180
cycle to provide value using metrics now

63
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,220
you're probably wondering you know is

64
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,560
this going to be yet another intelligent

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,160
cycle presentation well yes yes it will

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,360
be so

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,160
buckle up and enjoy the ride

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,480
so before we continue I just want to

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,459
make sure that everyone understands

70
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,220
where I'm building my resources on so I

71
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,200
am basically standing on the shoulders

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,599
of giants when it comes to today's topic

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,580
and I have to give credit where credit

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,220
is due so those who came before me

75
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,800
really helped me expand on the subject

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,019
of feedback and metrics and that's

77
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,000
specifically in the intelligence program

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,159
we're using here at the Nordic Financial

79
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,019
search and

80
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,239
it might be that what I'm showing you

81
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,599
today the process of uh doing the things

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,180
that the other people have done might

83
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,760
help you too so first I have to give a

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,459
shout out to two fantastic cyber

85
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,860
Security Professionals Maria cashavan

86
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,560
and Tony gidwani I'm sorry if I

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
butchered your last names but you know

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm Norwegian so I can get away with it

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,620
and they presented their take on how to

90
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,500
do metrics at the sand CTS Summit I

91
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,319
think it was 2019 and and the link you

92
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,060
can also find that in the resource

93
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,900
resource Channel

94
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,080
um uh a year or so later uh uh another

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,940
cyber security professional a fantastic

96
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,680
guy he's also presenting here at the

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,780
sand Summit this year he published uh

98
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,360
his take on the works of Tony and Marika

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,159
and where he basically tried to

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,980
operationalize the metrics items uh and

101
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,319
how you can use them and use their work

102
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,540
as a Baseline and he made his

103
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,180
suggestions available in his GitHub and

104
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,700
and you can find the links again in the

105
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,298
resource uh channel uh on on Slack

106
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,298
so the the question both of these people

107
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,919
or both of these groups of people

108
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,860
basically was trying to answer was how

109
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,020
can we show that our cyber threat

110
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,720
intelligence program provides value to

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,699
organization now now that's a really

112
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,759
tall order and this is basically The

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,199
Core Essence of what I will talk about

114
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,220
today

115
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,800
they try to operationalize it I will

116
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,600
take a step back and I will try and talk

117
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,240
more about the process what can you do

118
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,639
sorry yes I'm going to talk about what

119
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,320
you can do and not how you can do it

120
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,000
that you basically have to figure out

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,880
for yourself and frankly I have to say

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,580
with so many organizations lately that

123
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,699
look at their cost centers and trying to

124
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,280
figure out where they can save money it

125
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,259
has become I think even more important

126
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,900
for those of us that work with CTI to

127
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,180
figure out how we can show value of our

128
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,020
CTR programs to the powers that be

129
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,160
so before we dive into answering uh that

130
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,380
specific question let's talk shortly

131
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,160
about definitions so how you all and I

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,639
Define certain words will vary and it is

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,880
only prudent and I think to clarify what

134
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,500
I mean when I speak about some of the

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,900
key premises of this presentation like

136
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,240
for instance metrics

137
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,940
according to definitions this measures

138
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,180
uh this is a measure of quantitative and

139
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,220
qualitative assessments and it's

140
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,560
commonly used for comparing and tracking

141
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,320
performance or production so the goal

142
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,600
here is to allow the business to monitor

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,539
for changes in order to take action

144
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,139
and the value of Matrix lies in decision

145
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,919
support reducing uncertainty and also

146
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,500
situational awareness or increasing

147
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
awareness of an issue and as a small

148
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,680
curiosity there are these three items of

149
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,380
values is actually perfectly aligned

150
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,080
with the purpose of intelligence and

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,180
that is of course no coincidence why I'm

152
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,560
mentioning this today but you all

153
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,720
understand that in a few moments

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,419
I also want to talk about what we call

155
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,940
Vanity metrics and that's all those

156
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,580
pieces of data that feel great when they

157
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,160
go up but basically make no real

158
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,100
difference to the success of your cyber

159
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,100
threat Intel program any decisions made

160
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,560
for management

161
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,120
uncertainty levels if they have gone up

162
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,460
or down or either situational awareness

163
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,880
how many attacks you were had last year

164
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,940
is not helping perhaps so much to the

165
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,699
management level today and they look

166
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,400
great but they provide no real value to

167
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,680
the stakeholder and that's sort of my

168
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,500
um my assumption then

169
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,840
a key element here it's what's called

170
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,300
gaming and and that's basically our of

171
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,460
core issue of metrics that we all

172
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,860
witness all too often and that's when

173
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,020
they adapt metrics to fit the narrative

174
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,000
rather than letting the results and the

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,940
data tell a story and this is the the

176
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,400
gaming problem which really is as I said

177
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,919
a fundamental issue so according to

178
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,560
Campbell's law the more a metric is

179
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,259
visible and used to make important

180
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,020
decisions the more it will be gained or

181
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,800
adapted to to uh a certain narrative

182
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,259
and this of course will distort and

183
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,539
corrupt the exact process it was meant

184
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,819
to monitor so if we then look at God

185
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,400
good hacks law anything that can be

186
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,039
measured and rewarded will be gained so

187
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,259
those two have sort of set out their way

188
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,340
of looking at it so if we now look at uh

189
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,360
an example what if the manager of the

190
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,300
Norwegian oil fund which is responsible

191
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,960
for 1.2 trillion US dollars each year

192
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,020
what if he was told by his cyber threat

193
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,139
Intel people that they successfully

194
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,060
stopped 100

195
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,460
000 attacks and I use those quotation

196
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,160
marks in the air last year

197
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,740
so let's suppose then that this same

198
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,440
manager or anyone in his management team

199
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,900
actually knew what they were doing and

200
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,759
post some really valid questions about

201
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,400
those numbers what what really

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,940
constitutes an attack does Port scanning

203
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,580
is that an attack is a vulnerability

204
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,740
scanning an attack is every single

205
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,839
fishing male on attack what about

206
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
detections versus alerts what is the

207
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,060
false positive ratio here so when we

208
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,279
look at the numbers one hundred thousand

209
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,640
attacks that's actually

210
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,459
273 attacks every day or as it says more

211
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,620
you know it more than one thousand of

212
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,720
those were serious that means you know

213
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,080
that's still 27 serious attacks every

214
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,920
day that I I do not um I do an Envy the

215
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,480
people who work then at their

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,820
organization so basically I I think

217
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,200
there's something wrong here where

218
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,380
someone has told this gentleman uh some

219
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,899
uh some interesting facts

220
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,500
so if the manager then or anyone of his

221
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,959
team actually starts asking critical

222
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,839
questions of the claim in this article

223
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,820
you will basically find yourself in a

224
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,800
pretty bad situation where you have to

225
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,279
uh defend the numbers you have and I

226
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,160
guess the the point I'm making is that

227
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,800
if you focus on value rather than volume

228
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,440
you will be in a better position to have

229
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,180
an informed discussion with management

230
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,019
and also defend your budgets and not to

231
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,240
forget demonstrate the value you provide

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,399
in protecting the organizations through

233
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,100
your CTI program I mean the the basic

234
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,620
issue we have if we do our job then

235
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,019
nothing happens so we have to show value

236
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,060
in a different way

237
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,839
foreign

238
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,300
so we need to frame the issue a little

239
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,519
bit and according to Sam's and I'm going

240
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,620
to read out some numbers before I get to

241
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,120
the what's on screen but according to

242
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,680
the sense 2020 CTI survey only four

243
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,959
percent of the respondents had any sort

244
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,360
of system in place to measure the value

245
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,040
of their CTA program however in 2021 in

246
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
the CTA survey of 2021 38 of the

247
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
respondents have some methods in place

248
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,459
to measure Effectiveness however

249
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:35,040
although the organizations are measuring

250
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,500
right uh 21 of the 2022 survey sorry 21

251
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,320
of those respondents basically said that

252
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,200
they could not measure whether the CTI

253
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,899
program was indeed useful and valuable

254
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,420
to the organizations to me this is

255
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,620
actually a huge problem and I think you

256
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,420
understand what I'm getting here

257
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,060
you really should be prepared when the

258
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,860
organization starts asking questions

259
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,839
about value

260
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,720
what is the value add of the Cyber

261
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,820
threat Intel program we're spending all

262
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,040
this money how is the CTI program

263
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,620
helping the organization make better

264
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,839
decisions how is the CDI program

265
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,540
enabling the organization to reduce the

266
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,700
likelihood of an attacker successfully

267
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,800
breaching the system you have to have

268
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,899
answers for those things what about

269
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,500
return of investment Roi what is the CTI

270
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,959
program costing the organization and how

271
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
much money is the CTI function making

272
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,839
and we all know that not many CTI

273
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,360
programs if at all make money I guess

274
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,820
unless you're selling or billing for

275
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,700
your services so if you're not making

276
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,279
any money you should probably figure out

277
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
a way to demonstrate how you're saving

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,940
the organization money organization

279
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,540
money somehow and if you do that you

280
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,880
need to be able to show how much the

281
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,339
organization is saving and how you're

282
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,940
contributing into that aspect

283
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,100
what about kpis they're going to ask you

284
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,320
about key performance indicators the

285
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,019
organization probably want to know how

286
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,839
it can measure this how that this then

287
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,820
can be put neatly into their

288
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,459
spreadsheets so they can do their risk

289
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,220
assessments and I think if we talk about

290
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,579
quantitative then yes you can probably

291
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,800
provide them with some some numbers and

292
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,320
some data and that's probably doable but

293
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,120
you know is that the most valuable

294
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,820
sometimes it is sometimes it isn't but

295
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,120
if we talk about qualitative it is not

296
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,220
that straightforward and and while I'll

297
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,279
show you more about that later

298
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,160
so I'm not saying metrics are bad what

299
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,260
I'm saying is that metrics are good as

300
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,600
long as they serve a purpose they have

301
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,420
to be used correctly and not gamed to

302
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,420
show you know quote and quote a truth

303
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,399
and um

304
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,160
I I guess another thing I think I need

305
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,380
to clarify here that I'm talking about a

306
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,779
certain context and me remember when I

307
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,779
said in initially that I am working at

308
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,420
the the sorry the operational level and

309
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,220
I am talking about the Cyber threat

310
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,920
intelligence program not just the

311
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,720
product or process specifically the

312
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,540
entire program and and the program is

313
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,300
the why we are here and also as I said

314
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,880
initially as I said uh just now also I'm

315
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,420
working at the operational level and and

316
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,000
just as the previous speaker said I'm

317
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
supporting both the Strategic and

318
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,019
tactical I'm the go-between I'm

319
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,180
translating requirements from strategic

320
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,060
try to operationalize those and have the

321
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,040
Tactical and Technical individuals help

322
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,019
me with that then translate the results

323
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,660
backing and into strategic speak but

324
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,820
also how to then show and demonstrate

325
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,060
value of all the uh tasks and and stuff

326
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,800
we've done and all the intelligence we

327
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,680
have generated

328
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,300
a key aspect I think and now we're

329
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,300
moving into the intelligence World a key

330
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,279
aspect I think is really important and

331
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,100
that's the the small little circle you

332
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,959
see down on the bottom right corner and

333
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,480
that cyber threat intelligence I think

334
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,420
what we all uh have experienced is that

335
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,240
we work with cyber and this uh

336
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,300
particular field the CTI field is filled

337
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,579
with technical minded people who speak

338
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,920
and know uh the technical aspect of

339
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,380
doing cyber threat Intel but perhaps not

340
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,839
the intelligent side and as you can see

341
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,519
of this model I really love this model

342
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,740
because it to me this shows that cyber

343
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,320
threat intelligence is a subset of

344
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,779
threat intelligence which again is a

345
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,720
subset of intelligence so that means

346
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,459
when we talk about cyber threat

347
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,459
intelligence we can actually learn quite

348
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,220
a bit from the intelligence process from

349
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,320
intelligence Community from the

350
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,620
intelligent cycle and lo and behold now

351
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,240
we're jumping into the intelligence

352
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,940
cycle and again as you can see in the

353
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,920
bottom right corner if you haven't found

354
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,260
the link I really really urge you to go

355
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,639
to my GitHub at github.com

356
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,860
errum the link is also in the the

357
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,920
resource the summit resource Channel and

358
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,720
there you can find a PDF so you can so

359
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,639
you can download that

360
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
now a lot of you have seen the Intel

361
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,800
cycle before you have seen this probably

362
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,380
in multiple stages in different formats

363
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,600
some has six steps some have I've seen

364
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,079
so many as 16 steps of the Intel cycle I

365
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,360
am using four and that's because that's

366
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,339
what NATO is using and I'm I'm just

367
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,680
following the NATO standard here

368
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,079
oh we have Direction and as you can see

369
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,300
from direction there's an arrow going

370
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,279
down to collection and then after

371
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,839
collection we can then start our

372
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,820
analysis and then we go to dissemination

373
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,620
and then we get feedback and we start

374
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,560
over again when we look at the word RFI

375
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,440
request for information someone is

376
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,079
asking us questions a stakeholder asks

377
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,060
us questions we figure out the what and

378
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,920
The Who and the why and then we

379
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,100
basically we start collecting data the

380
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,139
data we're missing we're collecting all

381
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,579
the things that we need to do the

382
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,160
analysis then we do analysis oh we

383
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,139
figure out we need more data we collect

384
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,060
more data we start and continue our

385
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,800
analysis while someone else is

386
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,660
collecting more data maybe you're doing

387
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,820
it and you're collecting more data and

388
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,019
then once you've finished your product

389
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,060
then you go to dissemination you're

390
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,440
spreading it you're sharing it you're

391
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,260
making it available push or pull

392
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,519
um and then of course you're getting

393
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,860
feedback and then you get feedback from

394
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,019
a stakeholder who gives you suggestions

395
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,240
on improving product or you have to redo

396
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,399
everything or they're missing uh

397
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,440
questions or new questions arise so

398
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,139
that's sort of how it works

399
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,899
the the diamond in the middle this is

400
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,660
often what is missing in every talk I've

401
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,820
ever seen and that's the management part

402
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
there we have two words one is irm

403
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,000
intelligence requirement management the

404
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
other is called CM collection management

405
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,459
those are two really really important

406
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,500
aspects of doing intelligence because

407
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,980
this is what is driving and giving the

408
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,140
foundation for your production of

409
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,520
intelligence

410
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,540
and also the yellow box Direction this

411
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,199
is where you can Define everything you

412
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,480
need to do and this is also giving as

413
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
the word is saying the direction of your

414
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,699
focus why you are trying to answer

415
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,740
certain questions why you should focus

416
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,559
on these tools on these techniques these

417
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,720
analysis and these type of sources to

418
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
get your data

419
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,919
now as I said most people talk about

420
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,860
this going clockwise however in

421
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,660
Direction there is a function called

422
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,900
intelligence dialogue this is where you

423
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,660
sit down with your stakeholder and

424
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,740
discuss what is it that you need and why

425
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,740
who is to stakeholder what is it that

426
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,260
they really wants to know what is it

427
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,900
that she when does she want it why does

428
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,000
she want it what type of product does

429
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,520
she want how does she want it delivered

430
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,220
all of those things you need and then

431
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,559
you go counterclockwise from Once you

432
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,080
know who's asking for what and why you

433
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,640
need to figure out what is the product

434
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm going to produce in order to deliver

435
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,860
on the requirements so you have to

436
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,020
figure out what is the product what is

437
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,419
the analysis you have to do what type of

438
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,820
analysis and what type of biases do you

439
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,980
have what type of biases in all your

440
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,820
data and figure out which SATs this

441
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,799
structure analytical techniques Etc so

442
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,200
all of those things you figure out after

443
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,080
you know uh what you're doing and why

444
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,720
but before you can do analysis you

445
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,100
actually have to then figure out well

446
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,980
what data do I have and what do I am I

447
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,620
missing and that's the the gaps right so

448
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,780
you have data you're missing some data

449
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,340
you have to collect and as you're

450
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,220
collecting oh everything into context in

451
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,440
analysis you know then oh I need more

452
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,179
data so you start checking all the

453
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,220
sources which sources are you going to

454
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,700
use and during the intelligence dialogue

455
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,679
you have a discussion and a feedback

456
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,840
loop with the stakeholder before you

457
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,480
start collecting I think most of us have

458
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,700
fallen into the Trap of just starting to

459
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,160
collect data before we actually sit down

460
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,280
and figure out what we're doing and why

461
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,559
so we need to go back to the stakeholder

462
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,000
saying these are the things that they

463
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,340
have asked us to do this is the function

464
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,799
and the process we're supporting now

465
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,140
this is really key we're also giving

466
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,419
back you know when they want it what

467
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,340
type of product how what it should

468
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,160
contain uh how I'm going to do this and

469
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,360
based on the feedback and make

470
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,340
adjustments and I want to go back again

471
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,140
and talk a little about the function

472
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,020
because this is basically the core value

473
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,780
if we understand who our stakeholders

474
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,660
are what they really want what they are

475
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,240
going to use it for how they're going to

476
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,940
use it and then how can we adapt and

477
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,760
also tailor both our products and our

478
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,580
services to them that's going to provide

479
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,440
extreme value

480
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,140
so you might be I might be asking now so

481
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,480
Freddie why are we doing this I have a

482
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
key phrase and that's the spend time to

483
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,240
save time if we can make sure we

484
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,220
understand who our stakeholders are and

485
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,320
what they will use our intelligence for

486
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,320
in order to ensure we're maximizing the

487
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,960
value of intelligence we produce we can

488
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,299
then spend time in the beginning and

489
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,880
actually spend more time we like to just

490
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
to make sure that we will save time in

491
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,140
the end because we're focusing on our

492
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,000
efforts we're focusing our collection

493
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,179
we're focusing our analysis and also

494
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,120
focusing and tailoring our dissemination

495
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,059
to the stakeholder and also gaining

496
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,419
feedback from our stakeholders of course

497
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,200
so there's this uh uh other thing I

498
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,240
wanted to talk to I just showed you the

499
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,460
NATO standard four steps that's how you

500
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,220
produce intelligence the Mind map you

501
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,980
see here which is huge by the way if you

502
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,720
downloaded the the PDF you understand

503
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
what I mean

504
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,220
and that's divided into uh six elements

505
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,740
the first element you see the red in the

506
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,860
top right corner is basically management

507
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,480
this is helping you identify and

508
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,419
prioritize your key stakeholders this

509
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,600
process will actually help you uh plan

510
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,940
everything so you can operationalize it

511
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,799
yourself because all of you will have

512
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,320
different requirements and and you can

513
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,720
hear do the dialogue and follow the

514
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,880
steps and look at all the requirements

515
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,340
and the value proposition of the entire

516
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,460
CTI program why are you here what are

517
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,740
they expecting you to help with for the

518
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,679
organization also help and discuss the

519
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,659
Strategic Direction with goals and

520
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,299
expectations you can discuss fundings

521
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,840
and budgets maturity and growth how can

522
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,720
you grow the program over time that's

523
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,000
all the elements that goes into that red

524
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,740
box over there

525
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,559
as I said this is input to the entire

526
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,980
CTI program all the other steps and this

527
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,620
is actually the most valuable because if

528
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,380
you understand this you have then you

529
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,120
have broken the code and I'll show you

530
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,679
why in a moment

531
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,380
the next part is what I just showed you

532
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,320
and that's basically uh sorry I have to

533
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,419
go back one that that's basically the

534
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,520
intelligence dialogue part of Direction

535
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,799
and that's broken down as I already

536
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,440
explained the intelligence dialogue with

537
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
your customers and clients on producing

538
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,020
a product and that's identifying and

539
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,059
prioritizing the requirements for the

540
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,880
product defining the process in order to

541
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,539
satisfy those requirements and also

542
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:41,159
identifying the people and the resources

543
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,980
you need to produce and disseminate the

544
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,260
finished intelligence and this as I said

545
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,480
is input to the intelligence process and

546
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,940
the products so the first one was to

547
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,760
program overall and this is just how we

548
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,159
are going to solve a requirement and

549
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,080
build a product and deliver it to the

550
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,659
stakeholder which are sometimes are very

551
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,240
often two different things

552
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,480
now as I already mentioned spending time

553
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,080
to save time so these two elements that

554
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,700
I have just talked about the top right

555
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,100
and the the all the way to the right

556
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,799
feeds into what we call the feedback and

557
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,520
metrics now this is actually the the

558
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,799
most important part and I really can't

559
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,500
stress this enough this is an excellent

560
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,380
Foundation to show value over a CTI

561
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,620
program this is key to understand why we

562
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,340
are here what is expected from us how we

563
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,140
can support our most important

564
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,299
stakeholders remember the first one was

565
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,980
to identify the most important

566
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,140
stakeholders and the second one was to

567
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,080
identify the most important questions

568
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,940
the value of each intelligence product

569
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,080
potentially we potentially can deliver

570
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,720
and this is as I already said the input

571
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,940
to the feedback loop and what we should

572
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,100
measure and that is the metrics and and

573
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,440
that is really the core value

574
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,740
now as I said initially the both Malika

575
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,159
and Tony and also gertian has

576
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,539
operationalized this section and I built

577
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,539
out the entire process based on their

578
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,620
work

579
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,200
and and sorry and they're also talking

580
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,299
about measures or performance measures

581
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,299
of Effectiveness which is uh you know in

582
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,580
in many aspects the qualitative versus

583
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,460
quantitative and and gertian is also

584
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,559
creating suggestions for metrics and

585
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,240
he's arranging it from starter to

586
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,299
Advanced and what you will see when you

587
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,880
go into the Mind map and look at how to

588
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,159
do feedback and metrics this is

589
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,440
basically Gathering input eliciting

590
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,600
input from management and customers and

591
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,120
clients the first part of this blue

592
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,520
section actually describes the steps and

593
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,500
process of how to get all the feedback

594
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,140
and the second one shows how to generate

595
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,659
metrics and it's divided into three

596
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,480
level the top level is the most value

597
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,419
but also the advanced and this is mostly

598
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,220
qualitative

599
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,220
this is basically discussing how has our

600
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,100
intelligence improved our security

601
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,840
posture how has our intelligence

602
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,799
contributed in saving money in terms of

603
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,780
breach stopped or ransomware stopped Etc

604
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,480
in the possible value the second level

605
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,940
is intermediate and that's a combination

606
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,460
sometimes a qualitative and quantitative

607
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,919
and that's where you try to investigate

608
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,340
what is it that we have done we combine

609
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,380
the number of reporting with the number

610
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,559
of intelligence requirements and have we

611
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,900
satisfied them yes or no and and what

612
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,419
have they used the intelligence for

613
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,179
now the the last one uh is the least

614
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,640
value but also the starter where you can

615
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,100
start you start with the the mostly

616
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,220
quantitative you try to uh calculate and

617
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,039
yeah so we have looked at the X amount

618
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,500
of ion indicators we have written x

619
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,720
amount of reports but as I've stated

620
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,960
multiple times the key is in the the key

621
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,000
value lies in

622
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,220
um the the the top one is the the

623
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,159
qualitative how have our security

624
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,100
posture improved Etc

625
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,200
and that ladies and gentlemen was

626
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
basically giving you now the framework

627
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
to use the Mind map go through the steps

628
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,539
and it's not meant for you to do each

629
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,159
step it's not meant for you to do

630
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,440
everything pick and choose pick and

631
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,419
choose the your maturity level and then

632
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,460
plan your future and plan how to grow

633
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,220
and yeah

634
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,320
that was it I guess

635
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,320
foreign
