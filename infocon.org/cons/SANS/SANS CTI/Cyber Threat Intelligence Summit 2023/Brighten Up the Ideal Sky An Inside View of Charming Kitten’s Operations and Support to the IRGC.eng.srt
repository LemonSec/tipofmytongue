that's great

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,680
who is ta453 they are a persistent

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960
targeted Iranian Alliance cyber threat

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,119
also known sponsors Charming kitten

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,640
icogen 018

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,460
apt-42 they target academics think tanks

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,800
different government agencies as Mars

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,820
we'll talk about

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,860
typically they'll Target individuals in

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,420
the Middle East U.S and some Europe

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,460
targeting as well we attribute them to

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,980
Iran specifically the irgc io which

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,280
we'll talk about why we believe that

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,899
so we just talked a little bit about who

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,399
Charming kitten is and talk about who I

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,860
am uh we'll talk about the different

24
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,120
tf-453 teams

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,739
we'll talk about the infrastructure how

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,020
some ways to track it as well as the

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,640
holistic support that they provide to

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,379
the irdc and then we'll talk a little

29
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,540
bit uh at a meta level about attribution

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,000
and clustering of this activity and why

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,320
it is a um maybe a case study for

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,760
why each individual vendor should have

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,159
their own name

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,500
a little bit about myself uh my name is

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Joshua Miller I'm a senior thought

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,100
researcher focusing on threats state of

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,299
land threats from the Middle East and

38
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,680
North Africa I work for proof point

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,920
which is an email security company

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm also a captain of the Army Reserve

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,400
and just started as an advocate

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,979
Professor previously I've been working

43
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,600
with Blue Cross Blue Shield in FBI

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,920
Chicago

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
um I'm not on Twitter anymore we can

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
reach me on keybase sometimes on

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,119
Mastodon

48
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,700
a big fan of lemonade and I believe that

49
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,140
uh it's good to get the most

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,840
controversial opinion out there early so

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,640
I think avocados are disgusting and

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,159
coffee is overrated because this is a

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,500
virtual talk I will not be offended if

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,880
you get up and leave I won't even know

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,259
that you're leaving

56
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,799
um so please feel free to leave

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,420
so let's start with the many signs of

58
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,979
charming kitten

59
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,280
um all of these images are from crayon

60
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,440
or the mini Dolly they are not once I

61
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,680
can't myself these are all AI generated

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,860
we're soft with dev0270 or Nemesis

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,959
kitten subcluster phosphorus

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
internet-wide scanning ransomware

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,200
extortion I believe there's a talk about

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,080
them yesterday uh or will be the first

67
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
day of the conference unfortunately I

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,260
haven't been able to see that yet

69
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,420
um but I'm looking forward to it so some

70
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,620
of the ttps wlsas I'm using BitLocker

71
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,660
this was not targeted though they did

72
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,959
hit a children's hospital they did hit a

73
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,660
civilian executive branch agency a U.S

74
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,640
police department but they're not

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
specifically targetedness to their

76
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,459
attack

77
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,480
um they also use a ton of different

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,280
vulnerabilities

79
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,379
um we don't see a lot of Nemesis kitten

80
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,300
or dead zero two seven zero um so we

81
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,060
rely on our funds at Microsoft and other

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,099
places to

83
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,500
sort of uh report on those

84
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,760
um one note throughout the presentation

85
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,400
you'll see QR codes these QR codes go

86
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,260
and are citations to different reporting

87
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,519
that I've used

88
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,099
um it is or blogs that we've put out as

89
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,319
an easy way for you to see the research

90
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,239
that we've referenced there's a lot of

91
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,739
good research out there on Charming

92
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,239
kitten and we want to make sure that the

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,340
correct people get the right citations

94
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,099
so the first subcluster of chairman is

95
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,080
what we call smooth Scholars they are

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
spoofing academics with free email

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,480
addresses outlooks gmails yahoos but

98
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,220
nine conversations they just want to

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,459
connect to talk about X Y and Z and then

100
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,840
once they do send personalized

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
credential Harvest is they're

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,379
personalized and filled to the

103
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,540
individual that was sent to them what's

104
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,640
interesting about spoof Scholars is that

105
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,459
they compromise university-affiliated

106
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,640
websites so websites that may not be

107
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,099
directly a university website but may be

108
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,720
related in this case

109
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,080
um we saw it was the soas

110
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,420
um their radio stations website was was

111
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,280
compromised and you can see here it's

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,659
very convenient they say Hey you can

113
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,280
sign in with any of these email

114
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,080
providers

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,780
let it just let us know sign in uh and

116
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,280
then you'll see the cred Harvest page of

117
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,320
those gather those credentials

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
um food Scholars is a set we track a

119
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,399
little bit separately we've only seen we

120
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,620
see less of actually compromise websites

121
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,199
from them because a lot of what we see

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,880
is actually active controlled and part

123
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,100
of idealistic sky

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,960
so idealistic Sky

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,580
um they are again using benign

126
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,199
conversations they're using actor

127
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,000
created email accounts those gmails

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,759
outlooks Hotmail sometimes a lot of

129
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,340
times they will send unsolicited blank

130
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,160
emails or draft emails sort of just

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,820
um

132
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,440
try to trick some email security

133
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,780
products at least attempt to they do

134
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,240
have relatively good English so

135
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,699
most of the time if you're looking at

136
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,320
this yes it's coming from math queries

137
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,400
but you're not necessarily going to be

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,380
able to pick out yes that is an Iranian

139
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,479
behind the conversation the English is

140
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,919
much better than I think a lot of people

141
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,380
would expect a lot of times they'll

142
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
might send a Google themes like hey

143
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,440
connect to a Google meeting but really

144
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,180
you're supposed to be a zoom

145
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,520
and throughout

146
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
um this we talk about the shifting kill

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
chains so they are very good at

148
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,940
iterating and keep on trying to

149
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,400
um infect their victims based off of

150
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
different kill chains so

151
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,780
there's a

152
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,580
unofficial BuzzFeed quiz

153
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,780
um about whether or not you're talking

154
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,639
to an Iranian hacker

155
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,139
um but when they talk about these benign

156
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,580
conversations what are they talking

157
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,440
about we see a lot of interviews and

158
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,380
podcasts Millie's politics human rights

159
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,060
new books that they they understand if

160
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,320
people walk around with a new book then

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
they're going to be doing publicity for

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,020
it

163
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,639
um those sort of things we do see them

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,919
focus a lot also on nuclear policy

165
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,780
obviously the different nuclear

166
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,280
negotiations have been going on with

167
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,160
Iran or a big deal they want to know

168
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,199
um what the people behind the policy are

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,800
thinking and we did see with the

170
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,380
conflict in Ukraine versus Russia we did

171
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,780
see some shift to talking about Eurasia

172
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,479
and some Ukraine uh lowers as well

173
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,940
another big thing that I do ideal six

174
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,699
guy does is think tanks movie so these

175
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,800
are just some of the things that have

176
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
been spoofed none of these are

177
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,580
specifically victims

178
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,419
um but they are spoofed in order to

179
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,400
present more realistic

180
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,240
um

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,600
kill chains to the targets uh one of

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,979
those coaches look like here's here's

183
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,500
two examples so on the top one uh it

184
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,660
begins again with benign conversation a

185
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,000
Dropbox link is sent after sometimes

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,840
days

187
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,780
of conversation to benign PDF there's no

188
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,120
s place in the PDF no malware

189
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,220
um just a PDF but inside that PDF

190
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,680
there's a link to a URL short or an IP

191
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
Checker and then that then leads to an

192
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
action control domain that harvests the

193
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
credentials

194
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,500
another example after benign

195
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,199
conversation a malicious URL essay and

196
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,819
in this case

197
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,100
um there's two things one there's the IP

198
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,240
tracker and then two there's the

199
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,520
phishing page that phishing page the

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,919
phishing page the metadata from that is

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,600
sent to a telegram page and that's the

202
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,720
ideal Sky telegram page that um Charming

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,759
Kinder was using that's the same page

204
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,460
that the IP tracker is also sending to

205
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,099
that's sort of the inspiration for the

206
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,020
title of this Blog the ideal Sky

207
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,060
telegram was named by the Iranians

208
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,620
themselves

209
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,919
uh and so what is the telegram so

210
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,380
due to a misconfiguration within the

211
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,360
telegram we were able to grab

212
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,080
um

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,300
the data and be able to analyze that so

214
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,880
from October 20 21 through September of

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,400
2022 there are approximately 3 500

216
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,720
entries

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,660
um entries were for testing the accurate

218
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,000
testing IP tracking redirects and URL

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,539
clicks targets that we saw uh there were

220
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,759
18 tanks two universities six different

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,000
foreign governments and close to 300

222
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,740
personal email accounts and obviously

223
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,120
the goal is to capture the email

224
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,139
practice I would note that this even

225
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,479
though that's a there's a lot of data

226
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,280
here we believe that this telegram was

227
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,340
just one of the telegrams used by

228
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,800
Charlie and doesn't give a complete

229
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
picture

230
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,000
um of what charmer kitten's been up to

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,520
and in fact when Google reported on

232
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,319
telegram being used by charmingham they

233
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,360
referenced a different telegram group

234
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,340
that had been open so

235
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,020
um this telegram group was then shut

236
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,180
down by telegram once the Google report

237
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,200
came out in September 2022.

238
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,659
so the next cluster we see is called we

239
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,700
call policy boss robbery

240
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,440
um

241
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,299
what we see here is a big thing you is

242
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,339
the use of compromise accounts so rather

243
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,140
than actor created accounts they're

244
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,880
using compromise accounts often with

245
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,860
direct links targeting high value

246
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,420
targets

247
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,060
um so for example one of these

248
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,899
um

249
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,560
in late 2021 there was a politician who

250
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
made comments about the negotiations

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,519
going on with Iran

252
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,860
um about five days later their press

253
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,320
secretary was targeted via a compromised

254
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,140
account by this subset of turmerican so

255
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,660
these are very much reflective of what's

256
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,300
going on in the news and

257
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,459
um

258
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,860
sort of more we think high value targets

259
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,580
these are not everyone gets to use

260
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,920
um or it gets targeted by these uh

261
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,459
individuals

262
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,640
so while Charming Kingdom the majority

263
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,380
of charming kitten does

264
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,140
collect um information by square fishing

265
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,519
and creating credentials we do see

266
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,980
malware so

267
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,560
um in Fall of 2021 we saw this use

268
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,560
against diplomatic targets both PWC and

269
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,300
checkpoint have both uh write papers on

270
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,620
this

271
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,620
um it's called we call it ghost Echo um

272
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,899
checkpoint calls it charm power was

273
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,700
first used against diplomatic targets

274
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,000
specifically those uh mscs in Iran and

275
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,700
we by seeing it over time over a couple

276
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,080
months we saw active development and

277
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,140
then also obstetrication trying to avoid

278
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,000
that side protection

279
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,760
basically the macro that drops

280
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,459
Powershell that then sends posts to this

281
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,959
community control and then waits for the

282
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,300
commands to run all the modules that

283
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,040
came back seem to be Espionage focused

284
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
and the checkpoint research really goes

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
in depth on what those look like but

286
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,839
gathering information screenshots

287
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,940
exfiltration of information

288
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,440
um that sort of thing so that's sort of

289
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,320
the malware side of charmington which is

290
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,019
um we don't see as nearly as often as

291
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,480
the spearfishing side of things

292
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,959
so then most recently we saw cork uh and

293
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,899
Korg was the latest example of remote

294
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,240
templin injection that we saw

295
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,420
um following up on the PWC research so

296
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,279
basically here you have multi-person

297
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,680
impersonation that send a OneDrive URL

298
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,480
with a fish to a password protecting

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
document they then provide that document

300
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,760
within that conversation over email that

301
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,380
document has a remote template injection

302
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,680
that downloads uh quorg and then Excel

303
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,180
treats all that information to the

304
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,800
telegram server

305
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,380
it exfiltrates the list of running

306
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,959
processes the username

307
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,779
VIP information

308
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,980
what was interesting here is that there

309
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,779
was no C2 information that wasn't

310
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,940
waiting for a command to come back there

311
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,740
wasn't any sort of bilateral

312
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,500
communication it was just collect

313
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,420
information and send it off our

314
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,279
hypothesis is that there was other

315
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,899
exploitation being done once you have a

316
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,700
list of running processes

317
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,880
you can sort of identify what made me

318
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,380
vulnerable the different

319
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,339
um

320
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,980
scanning or different exploits but we're

321
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,300
just we're not sure this was definitely

322
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,019
more targeted than the previous malware

323
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,940
charm power but it's still something

324
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,220
that we're we're not sure what happened

325
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,899
here as far as why there wasn't no

326
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,060
commanding control

327
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,220
and I said multi-person impersonation I

328
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,560
didn't really Define that so

329
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,820
when we talk about multi-person

330
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,500
impersonation what we're talking about

331
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,240
is more than two act or controlled

332
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,640
personas on a single thread

333
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,640
um ta453 is not the first directed to do

334
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,860
this in fact we actually see a point

335
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,800
with some of the more advanced email

336
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,540
broader business email compromised

337
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,040
actors

338
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,839
um but what you see here is an example

339
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,540
where in order to build the social group

340
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,220
and take advantage of that social groups

341
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,260
one after control emo you know the

342
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,839
Target and CC another actor

343
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,420
um that actor that succeed will then be

344
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,040
like yes I agree this is a great

345
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,480
opportunity

346
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,860
um and sort of build the software group

347
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,100
for the initial approach

348
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,540
um sometimes they'll share password

349
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,040
sometimes they'll say hey I'm so sorry

350
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
uh in one example here

351
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,959
um you actually see so Carol had sent

352
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,300
the example of hey would you read my

353
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,820
article any comment on it

354
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,660
um

355
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,540
she in this example on the screenshot we

356
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,100
do see

357
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,260
um her providing the password but in the

358
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,779
same conversation uh two days later when

359
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,459
the the individual then had not

360
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,959
responded

361
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,579
the target

362
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,380
um one of the other personas dropped

363
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,120
Carol from an email and then said hey I

364
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,240
am so sorry for Carol's um

365
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,040
timeliness here's the password please

366
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,600
let us know if you have any questions so

367
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,100
they definitely try to play off the

368
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,079
social group and sort of take advantage

369
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,240
of the fact that

370
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,860
um

371
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,519
there's

372
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,100
um sort of this

373
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,079
Authority that comes with having one of

374
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,120
your peers often a trusted peer to

375
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,540
validate this ta-43 persona

376
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,000
so we also see a lot of ad hoc testings

377
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,639
so not it's not just people involved in

378
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,860
foreign policy it's not just people

379
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,899
involved in

380
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,820
um diplomacy so

381
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,220
we do see a lot of especially starting

382
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,100
back in 2021 actually we saw a lot of

383
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,660
taurine of women than gender studies

384
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,940
experts so prior to all of the

385
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,060
Revolution and protests going on in Iran

386
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,680
the iridency clearly cared about women's

387
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,260
and gender studies and specifically

388
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,220
those

389
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,720
um

390
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,399
maybe those that have been talking about

391
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,680
we also see both

392
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,600
um bad blood which is one of the first

393
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,519
campaigns we've published on for this

394
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,200
group but also just recently with the

395
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,060
multi-person impersonation where they're

396
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,820
going after organ regeneration research

397
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,920
and so some really Advanced Medical

398
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,680
Research that they're interested in

399
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,200
um we also see them targeting an

400
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,180
engineer at an aerospace company who is

401
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,600
involved in uh space research

402
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
um sort of interesting

403
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:35,940
um

404
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,560
we don't necessarily know why we know

405
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,399
the irdc cares about research no cares

406
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,500
about space rather and is in inserting

407
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,060
themselves into the Iran space program

408
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,680
so maybe they wanted to have some

409
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,480
understanding of what was going on in

410
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,980
that space

411
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,839
one of the really interesting ones for

412
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
us was a florida-based realtor and if

413
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,940
you look uh it's the screenshot we have

414
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,279
where they're asking they're saying they

415
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,100
want to film some content and look at

416
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,899
that so what's interesting here though

417
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,760
is that

418
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,060
um this realtor at the time was actually

419
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,459
having had muscle sales for homes near

420
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,920
U.S centcom obviously sanctum is

421
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,579
responsible for the military

422
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,500
U.S military presence in the Middle East

423
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,720
so it would make sense that the irgc

424
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,500
would um be of be interested in having

425
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,779
some sort of location near that

426
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:28,980
organization

427
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,720
um unfortunately we blocked this so we

428
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,480
didn't get to see uh what happened

429
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,959
um but they were at least interested

430
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,760
um one of the ways specifically for this

431
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,860
one that we attributed was based off of

432
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,880
the

433
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,680
tracking pixel so there's a one by one

434
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,680
tracking pixel here that links to a site

435
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,459
profile pic.site that we attributed to

436
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,480
ta-453 based off some infrastructure

437
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,199
overlaps that we've seen previously and

438
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,899
we there's a we'll look at a Blog that

439
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,639
we did later on

440
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,459
about some of these ad hoc taskians and

441
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,839
there's some more details in that blog

442
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,820
we've also seen us-based government

443
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,639
officials what's interesting about this

444
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,160
is it's not just hey here's a random

445
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,579
blur for us U.S officials but it's hey

446
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:18,240
here's a veteran study or hey higher

447
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Heroes it's very much uh

448
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,420
themed to what you would expect a

449
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,300
veteran or a member of the military

450
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,320
would be interested in we also saw uh an

451
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,940
individual same individual that targeted

452
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,260
both

453
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,300
U.S based government officials as well

454
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,100
as

455
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,320
Millie's oil and gas industry and that

456
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,420
same Persona Samantha

457
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,579
um also then started lodging complaints

458
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,579
against different European militaries

459
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,220
um using the same Samantha Gmail so sort

460
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,459
of interesting you have a Persona that

461
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,620
is used across

462
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,399
um

463
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,220
programs if you will so you have

464
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,139
Espionage you have targeted academics

465
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,240
and oil and gas all by the same Persona

466
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,459
which is super interesting

467
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,260
um and then as far as the ad hoc tasking

468
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,359
is in that idealistic Sky telegram there

469
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,400
was also a lot of targeting Iranian

470
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,619
travel agencies this makes sense when

471
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,179
you consider the irdc have

472
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,720
responsibility for keeping track of

473
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,059
Iranians coming to and from and

474
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,699
traveling uh to and from Iran so it

475
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:24,839
makes sense that there would be interest

476
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,720
in Iranian travel agencies and then also

477
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,179
for an embassy Personnel so not just

478
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,100
um members of the MSC or foreign members

479
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,600
of the embassy but also people who are

480
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,039
teaching at the school

481
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,020
the local schools that sort of thing

482
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,100
we're all of interest to Charming care

483
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,360
so

484
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,620
they're interested in all those things

485
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,080
what do they do so Human Rights Watch

486
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,419
recently published a great blog

487
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,280
um and we'll identified a couple

488
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,260
different things one they do use at

489
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,440
times these compromise accounts for

490
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
um for their fish and we'll see examples

491
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,919
of that soon but

492
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,080
they also use Google takeout to sort of

493
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,660
exfiltrate all of the information all at

494
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,500
once

495
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,940
um and they also synchronize the mailbox

496
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,039
to our Microsoft service so

497
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,480
um sort of again it's sort of the

498
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,160
exfiltration of that information so then

499
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,400
later processing by the irgc

500
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,860
one of the ways to retract ga433 is

501
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,720
through their infrastructure

502
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,179
um we see a couple different pages a

503
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,039
couple different types of pages we see

504
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,299
credential harvesting pages that are

505
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,220
actually controlled we see spooking

506
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,840
pages about different universities or

507
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,340
think tanks

508
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,080
we also see Ur entrepreneurs and

509
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,539
commanding people there's a lot of good

510
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,520
research on different Charming kitchen

511
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,740
infrastructure this is just one example

512
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,760
of how this IP which was hosting

513
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,679
uh terminating

514
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,780
uh commanding control infrastructure

515
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,880
hosts a variety of different domains

516
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,980
that also were used for like community

517
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,720
control so they don't

518
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,240
um isolate their infrastructure wall

519
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,980
we do

520
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,600
see the use of unique LDS like Dot

521
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,460
site.icu.info and Dot XYZ

522
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,960
um and that combined with some other

523
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,480
unique registration patterns helps us

524
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
attribute this these different types of

525
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
infrastructure to Charming given

526
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,860
uh and I know we started with talking

527
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,600
about holistic supports irdc operations

528
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,460
that's one of the exciting things I

529
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,320
think about this talk

530
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,780
so let's talk about what we see

531
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,980
um and we can you can make your own

532
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,320
choice on whether or not uh our Charming

533
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,419
kitten is supporting the irbc

534
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,020
so in May of 2022 Shin Bet identified

535
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,360
the irdc activity Divine deliver Israeli

536
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,880
targets abroad to kidnap them uh in

537
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,179
summer of 2021 we see and this is

538
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,460
reflected also on the reporting by

539
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,679
shinbeck

540
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,799
that this domain was given to invite a

541
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,600
researcher to a Zurich strategic

542
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,520
dialogue

543
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,140
so you have

544
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,140
um them inviting people to conferences

545
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,520
um obviously for dialogue to then

546
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,000
possibly kidnap them in May of 2022 uh

547
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,700
that we saw an intimidation campaign so

548
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,520
what we saw was one individual targeted

549
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
by three different compromised accounts

550
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,880
some of which were very high value

551
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,679
accounts meaning the individuals who are

552
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,000
high-ranking military intelligence

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,179
Personnel or important ngos but three

554
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,400
different comrades accounts using the

555
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,679
same domain to deliver this message of

556
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,940
intimidation

557
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,160
first message in Hebrew basically says

558
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,900
we're watching you every email you get

559
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,200
could be from us we're following you

560
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,360
um basically it's meant to intimidate

561
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,860
the individual

562
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,720
and message and specifically mentions

563
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,340
physical surveillance and watching the

564
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,900
individual

565
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,679
um

566
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,260
so that was super

567
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,500
off for us and something that was

568
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,820
um unique in that get together quest

569
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,760
which is where the image was hosted on

570
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,539
um

571
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,240
was shared infrastructure with the

572
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,580
previous identified domain by this

573
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,799
relation but about the invitations to

574
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,660
the search strategic dialogue so this is

575
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,480
an example of instead of just fishing or

576
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,220
sort of trying to get this individual's

577
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,840
credentials they would just straight up

578
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,419
Pay Here's messages we just want to mess

579
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,240
mess with you which is unique for ga43

580
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,720
and pretty aggressive as far as

581
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,580
Espionage related

582
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,280
um or state aligned uh fishing campaigns

583
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,299
call

584
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,299
so additionally um and on top of all

585
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,620
that in August of 2022 the doj announced

586
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,780
embankments against uh

587
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,240
some individuals who were plotting to

588
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,980
murder former U.S officials including

589
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,900
the formal National Security advisor

590
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,720
advisor

591
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,700
so this came out in August

592
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,740
um what was interesting is for us a

593
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,360
close affiliate of one of the two

594
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,400
individuals that was targeted

595
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
um in the plot was also successfully

596
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,900
compromised by the court malware in the

597
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,539
middle of 2022 so you have a close

598
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,820
affiliate of someone who's been quoted

599
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,159
or who's murder is being plotted

600
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,320
targeted by charmington and malware

601
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
that's super interesting to us and now

602
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,039
on the other hand I will say that that

603
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,260
same individual was targeted during

604
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,460
their time in government with

605
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,559
traditional fishing links

606
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,780
uh from the idealistic Sky telegram that

607
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,520
we talked about so

608
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,039
it's not a straight line to say yes this

609
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,260
is directly operational supporting irbc

610
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,059
but it's definitely interesting enough

611
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,780
for us to sort of put it out there

612
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,419
as far as attribution goes

613
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,059
um so we attribute

614
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,740
ta453 to the irgcio which is the

615
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,380
intelligence organization of the irdc

616
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,179
a couple different ways we do this one

617
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,059
on a soft level

618
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,460
the targets that we see reflect what the

619
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,179
irdc has been published as their mandate

620
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,320
Additionally the U.S indictments against

621
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,140
Monica Whit was a Air Force officer who

622
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,240
defected to Iran specifically to haul

623
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,580
out how she was providing intelligence

624
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,100
packets to the irgcio in order to fish

625
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,980
them over social media and email

626
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,799
and then lastly U.S intelligence against

627
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,559
Nemesis kitten we do see some

628
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,720
indictments against and sanctions

629
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,220
against them Nemesis hidden and

630
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,559
different companies so

631
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,020
closing up

632
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,100
um

633
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,380
Charming kitten this is a great overview

634
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,559
of what charmingham looks like for us

635
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,500
as far as different names for different

636
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,260
vendors everyone has our own name we

637
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,720
know the t43 pretty much maps to what

638
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,440
mandian calls 1842 we also let Tia 453

639
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,480
is a subset of what Microsoft tracks is

640
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,539
phosphorus Nemesis kitten sort of is a

641
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,960
subset of phosphatos as well

642
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,460
apg35 yes there is some reporting that

643
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,280
has apt-35 activity that is actually

644
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,080
Charming kitten but a lot of it's

645
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,640
separate so whenever it falls under

646
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,140
tortoise shell so it falls into

647
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,059
achieve455 which is a different group

648
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,640
and so this is sort of our way of

649
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,679
looking at overlap

650
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,740
for tier 433 and four active actors of

651
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,080
saying hey it's not a one-to-one there's

652
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,120
overlaps and so we need to talk with

653
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,280
industry talk with friends friends at

654
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,440
different places sort of understanding

655
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,940
what

656
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,840
uh makes the most sense as far as

657
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,039
overlapping and sort of showing this is

658
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,840
what we see as proof point we don't we

659
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,580
see the fish inside things we don't see

660
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,840
necessarily the ransomware side of

661
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
things and sort of deferring and

662
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,900
illustrating that in a way that makes

663
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,200
sense for our customers and consumers

664
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,600
so quick mitigations

665
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,580
um the biggest one here uh the emergence

666
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,760
Pro rule set it's really cheap uh we put

667
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,140
a lot of Intel and Teller so if you're

668
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,520
not an emergency customer please

669
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,440
consider it

670
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,419
we talked a lot about today

671
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:37,620
um if you have any questions please

672
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,940
reach out

673
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,039
