1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,780
foreign

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,019
a lot of talk about various facets of

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,599
things but I really like to stick with

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,120
or focus on the so what what is it that

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,500
we're trying to achieve through

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,420
intelligence practices and intelligence

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,779
research so with that said currently I

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,699
am doing threat intelli things for

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,760
Huntress uh and have been for about two

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,740
weeks now previously I was running

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,480
detection engineering and threat Intel

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,300
for gigamon and had various stops in the

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,559
CTI world at uh domain tools dragos did

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,000
incident response at Los Alamos National

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,860
Laboratory for a few years and then did

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,960
various things in the U.S Navy but we

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,160
don't really care about that what we

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,260
really care about is on the next slide

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,539
there we go our agenda we're going to

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,039
start up by defining intelligence

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,020
because you know what we haven't talked

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,539
about that today yet uh might seem like

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,860
we're in a cyber threat intelligence

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,600
conference right everyone knows what

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,160
intelligence is and we agree on that

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,500
response right well as Chris pointed out

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,820
in his Keynote

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,540
looking at our definition of things and

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,939
our agreement or lack thereof can be

30
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,260
very important in trying to understand

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,760
just where we're going and what it is

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,500
that we're speaking about once we're

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,240
settled on a definition or at least my

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,740
working definition for threat

35
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,720
intelligence for this discussion we'll

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,580
then move into how intelligence gets

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,799
applied and then transition into a

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,780
discussion on detections and then

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,460
conclude with an intelligence-driven

40
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,080
approach to detection development and

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
engineering

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,500
so with that let's define intelligence

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,600
right because this is simple but what is

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,619
intelligence

45
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,900
uh that's a little small I guess for the

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,000
folks in the back my apologies but uh

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,040
you know intelligence it means a lot of

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
different things or whatever you could

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,759
have your you know pseudo Jack Ryan or

50
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,400
whatever Persona James Bond stuffed or

51
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,979
whatever and the TPS report in the lower

52
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,720
right is kind of what you actually do or

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,759
at least it feels that way sometimes you

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,140
know intelligence it's about coming up

55
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,759
with indicators sharing them and writing

56
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,100
reports and stuff right well not really

57
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,259
that would kind of suck wouldn't it uh

58
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,479
so really what I like to look at when it

59
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,040
comes to intelligence is viewing

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,020
intelligence as decision support because

61
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,479
stakeholders whoever our audience is

62
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,480
that drives the need for a CTI program

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,520
they need to make decisions and the

64
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,099
problem is that in almost all cases

65
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,440
those decisions are made with incomplete

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,959
or imperfect information so intelligence

67
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,319
can step in to reduce but not eliminate

68
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,780
that uncertainty and that can go from

69
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,640
business intelligence to threat

70
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,879
intelligence to more classic sort of uh

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,099
government uh intelligence program and

72
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,020
so forth but the idea being is that

73
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,540
whether it is some General on the

74
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,220
battlefield to an executive in the

75
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,260
boardroom to Jimmy the stock analyst

76
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,879
who's working the third shift or

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,040
whatever and has an alert come up that

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,560
their decision when it comes to what is

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,019
facing them at that moment is improved

80
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,760
by the information that we can provide

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,580
as an intelligence product of some sort

82
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,500
so in looking at that we can break

83
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,959
decision making down effectively into

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,060
two areas uh there was a previous

85
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,620
presentation that threw an operational

86
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,420
and operational always seems like it

87
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,800
messes people up so we'll just skip that

88
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,440
one for now uh but we have very tactical

89
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,200
decisions that can look into specific

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,300
adversary actions as well as the

91
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,280
countermeasures and responses to those

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
uh adversary actions making for very

93
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,739
tactical decisions as well as strategic

94
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,080
decisions that get into higher level

95
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,120
investment in planning as well as

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,980
discussions like Risk evaluation and

97
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,599
tolerance which are discussions that no

98
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,739
one wants to have because those are

99
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,019
boring but important uh we're going to

100
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,120
focus on the upper part here of tactical

101
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,700
decision making for the purpose of this

102
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,379
presentation because we're talking about

103
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,120
a very tactical subject of detection

104
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,280
development and detection deployment

105
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,980
so with that said how do we then start

106
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,500
applying this decision support in a way

107
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,379
that matters in a tactical very tactile

108
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,720
to use a little bit of alliteration here

109
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,599
passion well we can look at our

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,459
intelligence cycle right tells us where

111
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,440
this gets applied it gets applied right

112
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,940
there dissemination and integration

113
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,440
right and we've had a couple of

114
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,120
discussions so far in the conference

115
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,519
about how this

116
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,140
sharing

117
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,720
out or getting information in the hands

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,519
of stakeholders can work but the thing

119
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,440
is is that just like none of us are

120
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,339
probably going to have the same

121
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,620
definition for intelligence pretty sure

122
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,358
very few of us are going to have a very

123
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,880
similar or common idea of what it means

124
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,259
to disseminate and integrate

125
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,900
intelligence into operations because

126
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,100
when we start talking about

127
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,320
dissemination and integration what the

128
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,300
hell does that look like I don't know

129
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,580
could it be reports

130
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,900
yeah I mean it kind of sucks I mean you

131
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,520
know reports are good I really I've

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
written a lot of reports in my day and

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,460
they certainly communicate a lot of

134
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,080
information but they take a while to put

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
together they take a while to read and

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
so we have to ask ourselves from a

137
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,080
integration and dissemination standpoint

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,880
if I'm looking at this from a very

139
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,860
tactical perspective how am I getting

140
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,600
this information out quickly enough to

141
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
matter and that is suitable enough for

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,220
stakeholders to ingest that they can use

143
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,960
this to improve decision making so

144
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,300
reports they have their use maybe not

145
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,400
quite what we're looking for here

146
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,620
what about Iowa seeds well in addition

147
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,600
to the fact that people don't understand

148
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,080
iocs very well I'll die on that Hill

149
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,360
um you know everyone wants to talk about

150
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
the problem with indicators like oh

151
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,780
they're Atomic they go stale very easily

152
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,479
they are very situationally dependent uh

153
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,740
you know the thing is that indicators

154
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,000
could be pretty damn useful though too

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,919
especially if you're talking about very

156
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,720
immediate support to immediate security

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,539
outcomes so like hey this IP bad like

158
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,039
okay that makes a decision pretty damn

159
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,979
easy in that case until it's 8.8.8.8 and

160
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,139
then you piss someone off

161
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:40,860
um

162
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,180
indicators

163
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,680
we could have a whole nother

164
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,940
presentation I have a whole other

165
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,400
presentation on indicators it is a thing

166
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,380
that we can do it probably isn't the

167
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,000
thing that we can do because there are

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,160
problems with this in terms of execution

169
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,440
as well as understanding but what else

170
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,940
can we look at

171
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,280
I think I won a contest with this slide

172
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm pretty sure this has invaded in any

173
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,720
presentation so far today

174
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,620
yeah

175
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,560
that's what's up Dave uh so we could

176
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
talk about behaviors we look at the

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,979
Pyramid of pain right like yeah ttps

178
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,600
like what the hell are those no one

179
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,979
really has an idea of what that means

180
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,960
either let alone how do you translate

181
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,660
ktps into something actionable you know

182
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,880
at the end of the day ttps most of the

183
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,319
time seem like they just end up as a

184
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,880
slightly shorter report that doesn't

185
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,960
really have a good way of getting

186
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,300
ingested into some sort of tool or uh

187
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,860
decision-making cycle to make a

188
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,020
difference so yeah behaviors are getting

189
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,520
pretty cool but if I'm talking about

190
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,860
supporting tactical decision making in

191
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,440
the soccer and IR engagement what am I

192
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,780
really doing here that's operating at

193
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,160
the speed that I need as well as

194
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,680
providing the sort of utility for people

195
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,419
to take action well there's another

196
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,340
option that we haven't discussed yet and

197
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,319
that kind of gets into encoding some of

198
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,600
these ttps in a way and that would be

199
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,460
catching adversaries and we have a lot

200
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,840
of Frameworks that we could use in order

201
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,539
to do so we have Sigma Yara Zeke

202
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,120
cerakata snort if you haven't been in

203
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,460
updating things in a while I guess that

204
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,660
was a little mean

205
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,699
um but you know we have a lot of

206
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,100
detection languages or alerting

207
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,720
languages that we can use some of which

208
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,520
can be very powerful depending upon how

209
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,319
they're used or how they're sequenced

210
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,840
now we start getting into an area where

211
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,759
we're providing something that has

212
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,180
direct benefit to responders to analysts

213
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,319
who are sitting doing security

214
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,960
operations but moving kind of into a

215
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,460
realm where I think most people in this

216
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,319
room might be a little uncomfortable in

217
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,699
writing maybe not so much a Yara

218
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,840
signature because we're so damn

219
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,580
dependent on things like retro hunts and

220
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,560
so forth and virus total for those of us

221
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,780
who could afford it uh but you know

222
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,819
certainly in other Realms such as Sigma

223
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,520
development Zeke scripting not something

224
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,780
that you see too many intelligence

225
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,220
analysts do at least not in my

226
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,660
experience but maybe we should question

227
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,919
whether or not we need to start

228
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,560
encompassing knowledge of these

229
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,819
disciplines into the intelligence

230
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,800
framework to try to understand ways that

231
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,139
we can begin applying intelligence in an

232
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,960
operational capacity because again what

233
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,520
are we trying to do here improve

234
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
decision making to enhance security

235
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,180
outcomes I'm talking about tactical

236
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,400
decision making that means reduce my

237
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,979
mean time to detect uh meantime to

238
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,440
respond goes down as well allowing for a

239
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,240
remediation of incidents and so forth

240
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
and that means identifying these things

241
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,780
in the first place uh you know certainly

242
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,460
again we can have a whole conversation

243
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,960
about threat hunting to find the things

244
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,300
that we miss but damn it wouldn't it be

245
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,379
nice if we didn't miss them in the first

246
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,960
place because we were using a refined

247
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,000
intelligence process in order to fuel

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,580
our security program well what does that

249
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,660
look like then

250
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,880
the detections we've had some languages

251
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,159
that we talked about that look

252
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,260
detectiony uh I suppose but what does

253
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,240
this look like in practice

254
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,520
so really if we want to take a fairly

255
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,919
simplistic definition of detections

256
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,240
we're really looking at the

257
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,100
identification of threats within a

258
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,740
monitored environment via an automated

259
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,620
or semi-autonomous logic or framework so

260
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,500
using something like a z script or a RS

261
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,459
signature or a sigma signature

262
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,540
informed by an understanding of what

263
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,339
adversaries are doing or behaviors that

264
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,440
we're curious about or concerned about

265
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,839
in order to codify that into some

266
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,459
language that allows us to then observe

267
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,440
these things when they manifest in the

268
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,420
network that we're trying to defend

269
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,399
so in looking at this as part of the

270
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
security workflow and again this is very

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
simplified maybe that's a good thing and

272
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,500
perhaps our workflows are a little more

273
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,019
complicated than they need to be we want

274
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,420
to identify observables indicators or

275
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,279
behaviors of interest within the

276
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,160
environment that we're defending to do

277
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,920
so we try to set alerts or alarms around

278
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,779
those items of interest and then when

279
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,640
they manifest we want to respond to

280
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,440
those items in the monitored environment

281
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,420
there's a lot of different disciplines

282
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,920
that come into here and we can certainly

283
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,839
get into discussions on things like

284
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,300
incident support Playbook development

285
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,880
and other items which could be very

286
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,279
valuable discussions themselves but for

287
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,200
now because we only have

288
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
19 minutes and 46 seconds we're going to

289
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,720
talk detections uh

290
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,519
and in looking at this we can have an

291
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,660
example I mean it helps to have an

292
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,279
example of something right and this is

293
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,480
actually a pretty simple one and

294
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,560
honestly something that you should

295
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,519
probably implement in your own

296
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,720
environment if you haven't done so

297
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
already identify instances where you

298
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,300
have an sslt or TLS communication that

299
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,820
uses an x509 certificate containing the

300
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,459
default interpreter uh

301
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,040
criteria that's pretty stupid simple as

302
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,839
long as you're capturing x509s on The

303
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
Wire which you know certain developments

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,740
and stupid privacy or whatever is going

305
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,060
to make that go away in a couple of

306
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,580
years but anyway for now this is a very

307
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,620
valid way of trying to identify that hey

308
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,660
I have a you know someone who's lazy

309
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,000
stupid or just doesn't care that is

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,980
launching an interpreter instance in my

311
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,700
network using https or a uh encrypted

312
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,279
Channel okay why is this simple it's

313
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,079
simple because it's a single observation

314
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,180
I only have to get one thing carve that

315
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,600
x509 out of the wire or capture the x509

316
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,720
as part of the TLs handshake it has a

317
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,459
very tight correlation to malicious

318
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,720
activity you could say like oh you're

319
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,920
gonna catch a red team like yeah that's

320
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,140
malicious activity the behavior is bad I

321
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,940
don't care that you know it's a benign

322
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,560
event or whatever it's like fine benign

323
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,880
true positive call them whatever the

324
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,680
hell you want but this is capturing

325
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,240
something with a very high signal to

326
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,459
noise ratio and it only needs one data

327
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,260
source so if you're doing any sort of

328
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,760
network monitoring you probably can

329
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,320
implement this in your environment right

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,660
now in a way that's not terribly costly

331
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,220
and that could be very cost effective

332
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,279
given the signal to noise ratio on the

333
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,680
given item in question

334
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,899
the thing is though is that not always

335
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,180
that easy uh adversaries aren't always

336
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,740
lazy unfortunately although you'd be

337
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,480
surprised how many are and so we have to

338
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,980
get a little bit more complex so for

339
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,240
example another thing that I would

340
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,860
recommend you try to implement in your

341
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,540
environment but probably is going to be

342
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,700
significantly more difficult to do so is

343
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,160
identify portable executable files or

344
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,220
binary files downloaded from previously

345
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,899
on unknown or unobserved network

346
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,959
infrastructure that contain one or more

347
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,640
function Imports matching a list of

348
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,620
items of Interest say encryption

349
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,420
function so you are looking at likely

350
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,820
ransomware samples that's freaking hard

351
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,860
because we're talking about a number of

352
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,180
things that need to come together in

353
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,620
building this detection in order to make

354
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,899
it functional certainly it's informed by

355
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,579
understanding what threat actors do

356
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,339
posts post exploitation binaries and

357
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,660
network space that they own that we

358
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,920
probably don't interact with all that

359
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
often downloading them and then

360
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,399
executing them in order to kick off a

361
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,620
ransom or incident or something else but

362
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,180
this gets pretty complex because we're

363
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,100
talking about multiple observations and

364
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,839
doing so in a way that's changed or

365
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,000
sequenced look looking for the

366
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,579
individual events none of which are

367
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:30,899
necessarily malicious or even

368
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,240
necessarily suspicious on their own such

369
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,760
as downloader binary file did so from a

370
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
previously unobserved Network space and

371
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,240
the binary contains some functionality

372
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,980
that could be a little snarky it's only

373
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,019
when we put all this together that we

374
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,940
get something that is really worth

375
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,880
investigating and we also have to worry

376
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,079
that at this stage we're probably

377
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,339
getting into a realm where we're

378
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,740
capturing some legitimate activity so

379
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,200
for example if we change this instead of

380
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,180
uh containing encryption functions to

381
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,519
say uh downloading to and executing out

382
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,860
of app data local temp okay that

383
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,600
probably is going to cap capture some

384
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,180
stages you're also going to capture like

385
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,980
Chrome installers

386
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,060
um so you know we have to wonder how

387
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,940
rigorous how effective is the signature

388
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,160
logic within our detection relative to

389
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,200
adversary activity and how much

390
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
information are we providing to the

391
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,399
analyst so that they can make a solid

392
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,980
and probably quick disposition as to

393
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,660
whether or not this is worth escalating

394
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,120
further investigating or declaring as a

395
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,240
benign in false positive event and this

396
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,579
very correlation between data sources

397
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,100
while incredibly powerful anyone who's

398
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,959
tried to do things like join tables and

399
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,779
whatnot in a Splunk elk or whatever like

400
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,940
not only is the syntax not necessarily

401
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,100
straightforward but that gets very

402
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,200
expensive very quickly and just very

403
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,940
hard to do

404
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,639
um so yeah this is good it's also

405
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,380
probably not where a lot of folks are

406
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,660
right now but this is also important to

407
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,519
understand from a intelligence

408
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,680
development perspective of what are the

409
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,180
capabilities of the possibilities

410
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,399
available to me or available rather to

411
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,440
my stakeholders so I know what to

412
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,760
communicate to them I know what

413
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,380
languages they speak I know what tools

414
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,180
they have I know what's relevant to

415
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,579
their operations and what's simply out

416
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,440
of bounds right now so we can read

417
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,079
papers about four types of detection or

418
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,600
how important detecting behaviors are or

419
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,820
doing staple detection engineering but

420
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,620
if your stock can't do it then what the

421
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,060
heck's the point of trying to integrate

422
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,279
that into your operations outside of

423
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,779
just trying to sell your decision makers

424
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,160
that hey we need to maybe invest in some

425
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,320
new tools and capabilities to make this

426
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
possible

427
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
so in looking at that we have a variety

428
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,260
of detection types that are available to

429
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,380
us the languages that we can speak uh to

430
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,420
our Frontline Defenders we communicate

431
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,880
in the form of very Atomic detectors so

432
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,699
whenever you see this IP domain hash

433
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,920
value whatever bad stuff's happening

434
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,019
yeah that can be pretty binary it's

435
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,399
either good or it's not it happened or

436
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,839
it didn't

437
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:58,500
um

438
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,660
very limited though in a lot of

439
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,940
functionality so probably not as

440
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,279
flexible as we'd like or need it to be

441
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,199
in order to adapt with

442
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,540
threats that evolve over time then we

443
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,339
could get into behavioral items similar

444
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,260
to our complex example where we're

445
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,060
identifying characteristics and the

446
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,160
Telemetry that's available to us that

447
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,500
match activity of interest that requires

448
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,240
more complex logic which is going to get

449
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,860
you a little bit further down the line

450
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,959
in terms of identifying really

451
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,760
interesting adversary trade craft and

452
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,100
activity but at the cost of having to

453
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,380
write more complex detectors and having

454
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,420
to have the suitable environment and

455
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,279
capabilities in order to actually apply

456
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,380
them more realistically we're probably

457
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,660
dealing with a composite uh where we're

458
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,399
combining different Atomic and

459
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,199
behavioral types in order to come up

460
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,000
with examples like our complex detector

461
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,420
of looking for PE file unknown Network

462
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,420
location with Shady Imports associated

463
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,220
with it this is where intelligence

464
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,079
really needs to step in and identifying

465
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,899
okay if I don't have the bandwidth

466
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,699
necessarily to investigate all of these

467
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,339
or I don't have the visibility necessary

468
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,560
to see all facets of intrusion activity

469
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,839
how can I Cobble together from a

470
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,779
combination of indicators indicator

471
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,899
characteristics as well as what glimpses

472
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,180
of behavior I can wrap my hands around

473
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,339
in order to put together something that

474
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,899
then is impactful in the environment

475
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,779
that I'm supporting and trying to defend

476
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,600
so in looking at this we can split items

477
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,639
down as far as detectors are concerned

478
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,500
the things that are environment driven

479
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,120
where we're looking for things like okay

480
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,800
show me normal and what deviates from

481
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,240
the Baseline like okay that's cool

482
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,760
that's data science this is not a data

483
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,620
science conference I am not a data

484
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,180
scientist I am not going to go into that

485
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,740
it's this cool stuff or whatever and

486
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,820
there are vendors that will try to sell

487
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,199
you that it will solve all your problems

488
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,300
we're not going there right now valuable

489
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,180
but within its own place then we're

490
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,680
going to talk about adversary driven

491
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,779
mechanisms in order to build detections

492
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,940
where we understand adversary operations

493
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,680
and requirements and then identify

494
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,259
observations associated with adversary

495
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,600
actions in order to fuel our detector

496
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,940
development process that gets us into

497
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,559
the realm of threat intelligence or

498
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,540
threat intelligence deliverables that we

499
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,540
can reasonably expect to have value for

500
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,520
our Frontline operator

501
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,799
okay we've covered intelligence we've

502
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,419
covered detections how do we start

503
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,400
fusing these together in a reasonably

504
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,380
effective fashion and doing this all in

505
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,020
less than 30 minutes of talking time

506
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,540
well let's revisit our intelligence

507
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,280
deliverables so we research and

508
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,620
understand adversary operations and do

509
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,960
so in order to identify the mechanisms

510
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,240
or artifacts of adversary behaviors what

511
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,980
are the touch points that I can see

512
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,140
within my visibility you know for maybe

513
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,120
I only have Network visibility you know

514
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,240
netflow DNS logs and proxy logs like one

515
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,660
good luck two uh that's honestly not

516
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,160
that far off from a lot of organizations

517
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,960
and so if that's what you're dealing

518
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
with you need to figure out a way to

519
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,020
support that uh in terms of not just

520
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,880
what adversaries are doing but how

521
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,940
adversary operations would look in the

522
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,100
Telemetry that's available to you and

523
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,840
once we come up with that Fusion between

524
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,760
understanding what we can see and what

525
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,919
adversaries are doing we want to try to

526
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,780
codify that knowledge of how to identify

527
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,360
adversary operations into some

528
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,880
sustainable lasting fashion that can

529
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,340
benefit our security teams

530
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,960
let's go back to the intelligence cycle

531
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,520
because we haven't seen this like a

532
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,500
dozen times today already right that's

533
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,760
okay it's there for a reason it's

534
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,400
important uh planning and Direction okay

535
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
we're not gonna really get into that so

536
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,720
much but certainly as a combination of

537
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,400
early stages of the intelligence cycle

538
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,140
we want to identify or have an

539
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,580
understanding of what are the threats of

540
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,620
interest and then begin researching and

541
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,539
understanding their operations that

542
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,100
doesn't mean telling your sock operator

543
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,020
and it's like well this breakdown within

544
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,179
Russia's Gru means that operational

545
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,980
control passes to this General sitting

546
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,840
in this office here he doesn't care

547
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
about that instead it means

548
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,539
understanding like what are the threats

549
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,160
that actually face your organization how

550
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,480
do they operate and how do I begin

551
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,580
collecting information about how those

552
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,919
adversaries might operate that gets me

553
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,179
to a point where I can start doing

554
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,039
things like examining technical data

555
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,840
whether that's capturing samples of

556
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,240
malware and running it in a sanitized

557
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,799
and monitored environment to see what it

558
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,860
does looking at incident analysis and

559
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,360
intrusion analysis to figure out what

560
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,400
adversaries are doing and then picking

561
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,559
out what are the touch points where

562
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,539
adversary action starts coming into play

563
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,160
for what I can do in my environment

564
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
figuring out what are those observations

565
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,059
or behaviors that are indicative of

566
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,039
adversary actions that I could then

567
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,580
inform my security team about

568
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,980
then you need to figure out what are my

569
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,600
Telemetry sources I could see this stuff

570
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,059
uh and this requires coming a little bit

571
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,260
out of our shells a bit and

572
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,940
understanding like okay if I work for

573
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,460
big Fortune 50 financial institution I

574
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,660
probably have all the bells and whistles

575
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,460
and can do a whole lot if I'm working

576
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,760
for the 50-person machine shop that is

577
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,100
maybe just doing some Cloud logging or

578
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,620
whatever and does um you know Office 365

579
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,880
and whatnot I probably don't have that

580
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
much visibility in fact they're probably

581
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,059
not their only they're a security person

582
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,919
you're probably coming in once a week as

583
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,960
an mssp contractor or something to help

584
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,940
them out so you have very limited

585
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,740
capability in order to really try to

586
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,080
help them to see these sorts of things

587
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,299
well between those extremes we need to

588
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,919
identify well what are the possibilities

589
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,320
that exist for identifying the behaviors

590
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,000
we've flagged as items of Interest or

591
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,220
high correlation to malicious operations

592
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,799
and to get instances of those

593
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,900
observations in front of a decision

594
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,960
maker to reduce that mean time to detect

595
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,600
and improve security response outcomes

596
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,360
because ultimately and you know this is

597
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,860
asking people to get a little Hands-On

598
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,900
and Technical we want to try to test

599
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,240
identification mechanisms that we use in

600
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,100
researching the threat and then try to

601
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,780
codify them in such a way that they can

602
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,299
be applied as detectors that could mean

603
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,480
some crazy Cabana query or whatever if

604
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,280
you're using that environment it could

605
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,520
mean developing a sigma or a Zeke script

606
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,440
of some sort in order to identify these

607
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
items but figuring out like okay I just

608
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,919
did a hell of a lot of work in order to

609
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,539
try to figure out what an adversary is

610
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,000
doing to try to find them in the network

611
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,980
how do I make the organization or allow

612
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,720
the organization to then benefit from

613
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,640
that research yes I could write a report

614
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,160
about that that's nice I can write a

615
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,299
report about it and present it at a

616
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,860
conference so that's even nicer right

617
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,220
but if I really want to try and improve

618
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,840
outcomes for the organization I'm

619
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,880
defending I probably want to get this in

620
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,260
some fashion that it allows my

621
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,179
responders to improve their outcomes

622
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,280
whether that's by finding things earlier

623
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,080
or figuring out how better to respond

624
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,400
things or just getting more information

625
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,679
about when and where adversaries are

626
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,880
popping up within the mod other

627
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,440
environment

628
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,419
so in looking with that we're really

629
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,020
talking about a seismic shift in terms

630
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,000
of how intelligence aligns with security

631
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,799
operations like you're not talking

632
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,960
you're not sending Yara signatures to

633
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,760
the ciso unless you have a very Hands-On

634
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,260
system in which case that's probably

635
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,059
uncomfortable

636
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,240
um I am sure there's exceptions Rick

637
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,039
um anyway

638
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,320
um but we're really shifting perspective

639
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,600
from what I think is an over emphasis on

640
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,280
strategic deliverables for intelligence

641
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,400
to very tactical applications uh that

642
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,260
align very tightly with security

643
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,480
operations centers incident responders

644
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
uh potentially threat Hunters if you're

645
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,559
you know well off enough in order to

646
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,940
have that sort of capability in your

647
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,100
environment and that's shifting our

648
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,659
conception of deliverables away from

649
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,820
briefings and reports to technical

650
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,980
observations and Technical understanding

651
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,559
of adversary activity that can fuel the

652
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,419
detection Engineering Process

653
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,520
this is really cool in my opinion

654
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,320
because it means that we start fusing

655
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,659
cyber threat intelligence from being a

656
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,880
potential Ivory Tower functionality or

657
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,500
whatever that is the ear of the board or

658
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,580
whatnot because we're telling you that

659
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,200
the Russians are in the network or the

660
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,940
Chinese or the North Koreans or whoever

661
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,760
is the flavor of the week right now so

662
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,000
instead getting really tied into stock

663
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,539
and IR operations in order to inform

664
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:47,039
immediate security outcomes it's not

665
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,260
easy and it doesn't always work because

666
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,860
either your Telemetry is poor or other

667
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,080
things go sideways but now we're really

668
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,760
talking about you know going to

669
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,559
discussions of metrics prove the value

670
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,960
of threat intelligence well threat

671
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
intelligence assisted in the development

672
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,679
of X number of detections that closed

673
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,419
off these phases of the Cyber kill chain

674
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,720
or uh a set addressed these minor attack

675
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,120
techniques Etc and we're really talking

676
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,400
about closing visibility and detection

677
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,799
gaps and improving security outcomes

678
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,980
through identifying malicious activity

679
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,200
uh so yeah I already talked to this or I

680
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,179
don't need a Believer at this point uh

681
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,460
you know really making CTI relevant to

682
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,200
secops Beyond just like oh they wrote

683
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,960
another report okay reports are cool but

684
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,760
now we're talking about really fueling

685
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,220
the life cycle of security operations in

686
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,960
a way that immediately indirectly

687
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,059
benefits them that gets us a closer

688
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,559
relationship with forward-facing

689
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,720
personnel and allows for opportunities

690
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,760
of shortening the intelligence cycle so

691
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,440
we always talk about feedback as being

692
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,880
important but we never get enough of it

693
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,980
well if you're tied directly into

694
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,980
security operations and you're either

695
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,980
qcing evaluating or providing for the

696
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,840
foundation of detectors in your

697
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,600
environment when those go wrong you're

698
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,919
going to hear about it so that feedback

699
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,020
cycle is going to pretty much tighten up

700
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,880
pretty quickly as well as being able to

701
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,799
see the relevance of those items and

702
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,840
what advice has been given towards

703
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,000
detecting and identifying threats within

704
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,240
the monitored environment but not all is

705
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,460
roses and unicorns and whatnot uh

706
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,500
instead we also have some drawbacks to

707
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,740
this way of aligning very firmly with

708
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,659
detection engineering uh that could be

709
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,280
an abandoning strategic views we can

710
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,720
only do so much you know we've talked

711
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,220
about economics and trade-offs and

712
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,440
previous presentations here we can't do

713
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,480
everything all the time all at once and

714
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,919
so if we're taking a very operational

715
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,380
Focus to our intelligence activities it

716
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,820
means that we're probably abandoning

717
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,940
some of our responsibilities or desired

718
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,919
outcomes in the Strategic space because

719
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,020
we fundamentally changed audiences and

720
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,100
that needs to be communicated

721
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,400
effectively in order to avoid

722
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,960
disappointment uh or other items that

723
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,000
may come back to haunt us we also want

724
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,260
to make sure that we're not completely

725
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,240
losing track of long-term trends

726
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,880
challenges and Analysis by losing the

727
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,120
forest for the trees so to speak uh we

728
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
still need to do long-term Trend

729
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,000
analysis attacker activity and

730
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,520
tradecraft and if we become too tightly

731
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,500
wound up with the ransomware flavor of

732
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,780
the minute and so forth we won't get

733
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,640
that perspective and the benefits that

734
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,980
occur to it such as identifying shifts

735
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,440
over time from macro enabled documents

736
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,559
to zip isos and so forth for attacker

737
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,059
methodology because we're so focused on

738
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,940
the here and now so like all things only

739
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,159
Sith deal in absolutes and so you as in

740
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,480
threat intelligence analyst should not

741
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,460
be doing so because you know we are on

742
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,020
the right side of the force so to speak

743
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,240
but really effectively trying to figure

744
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,760
out ways that we can continue to have

745
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,500
some perspective on the overall threat

746
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,140
environment while not abandoning or

747
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,299
going so far in that direction that we

748
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,039
lose sight of the very real and very

749
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,080
immediate uh immediately beneficial

750
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,480
outcomes that can be gained by ensuring

751
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,400
tight threat intelligence integration

752
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,340
with Frontline Security personnel as

753
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,740
communicated through an

754
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,279
intelligence-informed detection

755
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,020
Engineering Process

756
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,820
so the conclusion

757
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,100
relevant secure intelligence informed

758
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,779
security Ops sounds like we all want to

759
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,279
do that right but I don't know if we

760
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,600
don't really do a good job of it right

761
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,799
now so there are ways that we can

762
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,360
probably improve that and this is one of

763
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,760
them detection development represents a

764
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,400
critical space for improving security

765
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,320
outcomes as well as enhancing

766
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,240
significant security decision making

767
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,120
across the organization by applying

768
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,559
threat intelligence and threat

769
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,419
intelligence principles to the detection

770
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,820
research and Engineering Process we can

771
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,220
start providing not just effective ways

772
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,380
to benefit the organization but also

773
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,140
very effective and Powerful ways of

774
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,600
showing the value intelligence brings to

775
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,720
security it's not just like oh uh Karen

776
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,159
over there the cubicle on the corner or

777
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,600
whatever she wrote something up or

778
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,980
whatever about the Strategic support for

779
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,240
us and how that aligns with

780
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,980
state-sponsored state-sponsored

781
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,779
ransomware operations and side jobs like

782
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,520
I don't know what to do with that rather

783
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,980
Karen helped Analyze This malware sample

784
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,480
and realized that we had gaps in our

785
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,700
coverage that were that couldn't see for

786
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,980
example uh RPC calls for lateral

787
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,200
movement within the environment and they

788
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,760
worked with one of our analysts in order

789
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,080
to come up with a way of identifying

790
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,220
this in our existing logging

791
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,860
infrastructure that's pretty cool so

792
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,900
yeah maybe moving a little bit on our

793
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,640
comfort zone from the Strategic

794
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,380
geopolitical space or whatever

795
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,720
intelligence analysis but if you really

796
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,700
want to sell your management that CTI is

797
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,860
valuable if you can prove that it's an

798
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,840
enhancing immediate security outcomes

799
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,880
and working hand in glove with your

800
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
security operations center incident

801
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,240
responders and similar probably going to

802
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,400
be a much easier argument to make but

803
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,440
don't abandon these guys

804
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,020
folks people whatever

805
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,539
um and yeah you know do some research

806
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,740
and detection development

807
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,090
[Applause]

808
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,040
