1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,940
well thank you Rick for the introduction

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,860
and uh thank you Dave for the Pyramid of

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,740
pain badge we're all repping it today uh

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,420
and also thank you everyone both

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,940
virtually and in person uh for joining

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,460
us and joining me as we talk about you

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,260
know uh the economics of cyber threat

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,480
intelligence operations and consumption

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,019
and production

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,660
all right so before we begin just a

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,759
quick rundown of today's uh agenda here

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,399
uh first I want to start off with a

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,920
introduction about myself what I do what

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
my uh work experience is like as well as

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,320
my dog obviously uh and then moving on

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,719
we'll talk about what is economics right

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,280
and what is the economics of Sabbath

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,140
threat intelligence operations

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,360
next we'll talk about consumption and

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,700
production essentially the outputs of

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,379
any CCI operations

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,480
then we'll talk about people process

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,000
technology behind CTI operations what

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,219
drives the operations themselves

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,619
moving on we'll talk about resourcing

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,960
scarcity trade-offs because ultimately

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,820
CTI operations are not running with

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,100
infinite resources right so there has to

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,140
be trade-offs and there are scarcity

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,820
involved

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,680
next we'll talk about economics of

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,360
demand or also known as Intel

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,820
requirements what drives the demand or

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,380
what do I drive to supply to the demand

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,299
itself the requirements themselves

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,939
finally we'll do a quick recap of you

38
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,200
know what uh we've been talking about

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,939
and some key takeaways and hopefully

40
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,180
everybody can learn about uh the sort of

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,939
Economics of society intelligence so

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,439
once again my name is Sherman Chu

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,479
currently I am a solution delivery

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,880
manager with Deloitte where I focus on

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,979
providing clients with cyber threat

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,540
management cyber threat intelligence

47
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,900
operations advice and operations uh

48
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,880
previously I was the technical lead for

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,860
a state and local governments CTI team

50
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,079
where we built the CTI operation from

51
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,100
the ground up

52
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,079
prior to that I was a senior Intel

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
Analyst at a financial institution and

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,340
in my past life I was a non-commissioned

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,560
officer with the US Army

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
as you can see my dog is also now in

57
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,899
Consulting mode

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,379
all right let's let's start so economics

59
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,000
right we've all taken classes before

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,520
high school college AP econ micro macro

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,739
econ I can promise you right now no

62
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,260
charts no there's no Pareto optimal

63
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,180
charts or whatever we're talking about

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,560
the principles the basic principles

65
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,420
principles and fundamentals of Economics

66
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,300
here so as a quick refresher let's talk

67
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,099
about the definition of economics itself

68
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,739
right as according to Merriam-Webster it

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,959
is a social science concerned with a

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,420
description and Analysis of production

71
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,640
distribution and consumption of goods

72
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,660
and services

73
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,379
now how do we apply that to CTI then

74
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,440
well if we apply to CTI that we can

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,060
think about think of it as the

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,920
involvement of or the understanding of

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,620
resources and scarcity that enables or

78
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,220
limits the production dissemination and

79
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,980
consumption of CTI

80
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,720
now you've got you you know everyone

81
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,239
here will be hearing consumption and

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920
production a lot so let's talk about

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,260
that for a little bit

84
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,200
so one can think of consumption and

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
production as two sides of same coin

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
they're both outputs they share

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,620
similarities right uh in that they have

88
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,860
to be timely accurate uh and relevant

89
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,440
they can be tactical operational or

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,300
strategic in nature

91
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,120
they also require people processes and

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,519
technology in order to actuate or

93
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,840
actualize

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,860
but the biggest difference between

95
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,420
consumption and production is that

96
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,459
consumption is really about the mapping

97
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,400
of available intelligence to defense

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,040
whereas production is to generate is a

99
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,140
generation of intelligence for sharing

100
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,019
and others peoples to consume so to

101
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,879
expand us a little bit a little bit more

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,220
with consumption you are basically

103
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,319
collecting mostly primarily Finnish

104
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,700
intelligence and then essentially

105
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,860
breaking that apart extracting the core

106
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,379
information from that to apply to your

107
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,080
own you know security posture

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
um whereas producing is uh you you're

109
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,860
collecting from a lot of raw

110
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,900
intelligence data your Intel internal

111
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,939
Telemetry or perhaps external Telemetry

112
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,580
to provide new insights of threat

113
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,959
behaviors or unknowns

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
so to further sort of expound on

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,358
consumption we can also apply the

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,880
mindset of consumption into the uh Intel

117
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,139
life cycle here I'm not trying to

118
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,060
reinvent the wheel and promise you uh

119
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,860
but at the same time you know I think it

120
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,120
would be good for us to think about it

121
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,340
through the phases right because you

122
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,840
still have to plan and direct what to

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
collect uh what to consume and how to

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
consume then you have to go ahead and

125
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,900
collect the information

126
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,699
next you have to process this obviously

127
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,620
because you know most collections uh

128
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,440
most fish intelligence are uh very uh

129
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,759
verbose

130
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,020
and then afterwards you've got to

131
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,340
analyze whether that is applicable to

132
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,380
your own environment and how what do you

133
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,120
need to extract from it and ultimately

134
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,979
you consume it so creating detections

135
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,080
analytics unpackages if you will

136
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,639
providing that to you know your

137
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,500
respective teams your sock your bread

138
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,080
hunters and then of course uh without

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,820
saying there has to be tuning and

140
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,720
feedback

141
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,919
you know you can't just throw a

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,720
detection in and just call it a day you

143
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,220
want to see whether it is spitting out

144
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,960
false positives or do we need to tune

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,660
for a certain you know um ilcs out of

146
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,419
the detection right so it essentially

147
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,639
follows the similar phases within the

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,360
Intel cycle

149
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,800
okay

150
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,380
so now let's talk about people process

151
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,580
and Technology

152
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,620
you know we've heard about PPT framework

153
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,160
before right it's a means to assess you

154
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,020
know economic activities in the country

155
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,940
or perhaps you know workflow activities

156
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,080
within the organization itself

157
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,759
and in CTI it presents the fundamental

158
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,979
factors that allows or enables for

159
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,080
consumption or production of threat

160
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
intelligence so how about we just break

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,660
it down um a little more granular and

162
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,860
should look at usually elements

163
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,400
individually

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
okay so let's start off with people

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,060
personally I believe that is the most

166
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,820
crucial uh element of all of the three

167
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,080
elements itself

168
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,660
people are the backbone of CTI

169
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,280
now when I talk about people here I'm

170
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,900
not just talking about the nuclear core

171
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,080
uh analysts within ctm itself CTI team

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,780
um but more so anyone that that is

173
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,759
related or impacting the production and

174
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,319
consumption of cyber threat intelligence

175
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,120
you know we're talking about of course

176
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,580
the analysts as uh cursive talk uh has

177
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,020
been talking about also detection

178
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,960
engineer just sock your cert your uh

179
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
leadership your Executives these are all

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,060
people of CTI and of course they all

181
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,460
come from varied backgrounds um if I

182
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,500
were to pose a question to you to the

183
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,360
audience now both online and in person

184
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,300
and ask them what is your background I'm

185
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,460
sure everybody would come from would say

186
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,039
you know I'm from I.T or I'm traditional

187
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,560
uh Intel or I come from you know more of

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,360
an academic background and the point

189
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,880
here is diversity is key right the

190
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,240
background is key uh for for the people

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
of Sonic art intelligence

192
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,180
of course uh people drives process and

193
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,740
Technology

194
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,600
we'll talk about that more a little bit

195
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,340
so process

196
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,680
so kind of like your furniture assembly

197
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,479
instructions it tells you how to do

198
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,819
things when to do things the protocols

199
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,699
and controls right but in in CTI or

200
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,440
mostly in processes themselves we're

201
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,940
we're talking about two levels of

202
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,759
processes there are macro processes and

203
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,319
micro processes

204
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,900
macro processes are more kin to your

205
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,940
phases in your Intel life cycle you have

206
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,860
the collection phase your processing

207
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,139
phase your analysis phase right

208
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,900
but I would say more importantly are the

209
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,520
micro processes that we often forget

210
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,099
about the small sort of controls and

211
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,780
procedures that we should follow in

212
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,460
order to make sure that these major

213
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,880
phases succeed so take collection for

214
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,680
example during the collection phase we

215
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,440
might have a micro process that involves

216
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,720
the evaluation of sources and

217
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,639
information right it may be the admin

218
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,680
Realty code that we are using to

219
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,780
determine the reliability confidence

220
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,940
level of you know a certain Source

221
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,800
information or perhaps during an

222
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,660
analysis space you know we we have

223
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,460
certain structured analog techniques

224
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,440
that we're using to ensure the quality

225
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,180
assessments so these are all

226
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,060
microprocesses and one thing based off

227
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,099
my pre my personal experience and

228
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,419
talking to a lot of colleagues within

229
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,120
the industry so we often forget the

230
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,419
importance of defining implementing and

231
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,819
following these microprocesses

232
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,059
and it is very important for us to spend

233
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,080
time to develop these uh microprocesses

234
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,839
and time is something that requires you

235
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,279
know people to commit to

236
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,740
so the last element within the PPT

237
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,660
framework is of course technology needs

238
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,100
no introduction we're all using some

239
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,779
sort of tooling and Technology here you

240
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,760
think about your scene your intelligence

241
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,279
platform your link analysis tool maybe

242
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,839
it's your python script that helps you

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279
uh automate some of those Monday and

244
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,800
more repetitive tasks right these are

245
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,560
all technologies that we are leveraging

246
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,180
so that people can do their task more

247
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,160
efficiently and that processes are

248
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,200
followed through now

249
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,060
technology itself does not operate in a

250
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,220
vacuum meaning you can just turn it on

251
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,680
and just let it run it obviously also

252
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
requires people

253
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,019
to once again uh develop maintain or

254
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,220
update

255
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,440
as we all know if you've just turned on

256
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,000
a certain intelligence platform a tip

257
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,560
and just let it run and collect all the

258
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,899
all the fresh feeds it becomes really

259
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,180
noisy and really floaty right you need

260
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,459
to analyst to go in and curate the

261
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:36,839
information to data

262
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,959
so all to say that within the PPT

263
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,019
framework people are the core

264
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,160
and people is a finite resource

265
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,200
So speaking resource

266
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,380
as we said resources are finite we hit

267
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,820
onboarding people having the ability to

268
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,940
hire on people you know is is finite and

269
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,320
people can only commit to a certain

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,180
amount of time or hours in their lives

271
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,860
to their job

272
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,500
and of course Financial Resources some

273
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,760
technology needs to be procured

274
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,040
monetarily speaking or you have to spin

275
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,320
up a team dedicated to the sort of

276
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
upkeeping of the technology themselves

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,640
these are all resources and the

278
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
resources that there are that are scarce

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,940
we have to look at trade-offs

280
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,920
we can't have everything right even in

281
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,420
metaverse we don't even have legs there

282
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,959
yet so

283
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,120
so let's talk about some of the high

284
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,459
level sort of uh trade-offs that we uh

285
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,220
that we can look at for both the p p and

286
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,560
t starting off people one of the things

287
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,820
I want to highlight here I emphasize is

288
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,160
that people cannot effectively consume

289
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,740
and produce simultaneously the processes

290
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,420
surrounding consumption production can

291
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,820
defer greatly some technologies can do

292
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,800
both but at that point there's a lot

293
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,740
tuning involved and as an organization

294
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,200
itself we need to sort of lean on one

295
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,300
side unless you are you know a

296
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,700
multi-billion dollar organization where

297
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,459
you can spin up two teams right

298
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,140
um and I would also argue that

299
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,800
consumption is harder than production it

300
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,120
was consumption of thread intelligence

301
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,860
requires you to understand your own Tax

302
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,839
Service the courses the defensive

303
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,760
courses action that you can take in

304
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,560
order to consume that intelligence and

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
turn it into something that will benefit

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,260
your organization

307
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,440
so while there are no scarcity for

308
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,260
processes right it does require time and

309
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,480
expertise from people to implement

310
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
refine

311
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,680
we can try to copy pasta a bunch of you

312
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,140
know uh process processes from from

313
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,300
textbooks or CTI textbooks slap it on

314
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,940
and call it a day but it is not uh

315
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,560
essentially compliance to your to your

316
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,180
organization's requirements your you

317
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,820
know the workflow and does take people

318
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,160
to go in and look at what works and what

319
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,440
doesn't work in terms of processes and

320
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,480
really refine them

321
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
um so that's time and expertise

322
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,899
and of course technology right

323
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,880
technology is there to augment processes

324
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,440
in people

325
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,839
um and it but it also requires people to

326
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,360
go in and maintain and tune and upkeep

327
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,579
so you can you can you can think of that

328
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,620
as more technology means more people to

329
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,180
actually manage

330
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,440
um so

331
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,079
some and there are often times uh where

332
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,880
a lot of organizations out there when

333
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
they spin up their CTI their first sort

334
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,620
of instinct is to purchase everything

335
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,019
under the sun

336
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,480
um and by focusing on technology first

337
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,700
we oftentimes would run into the problem

338
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,800
of people maintaining it and a lot of

339
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,680
this technology would deprecate so

340
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,839
people people-centric CTI

341
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,639
Okay so

342
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,260
we'll talk about some balancing or

343
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,260
balances between the three elements here

344
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,800
um

345
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,160
as you know reality dictates equilibrium

346
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,680
equilibrium is hard to achieve in

347
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,279
economy and both in any organizations so

348
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,240
gotta present you with three

349
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,560
hypotheticals here these are extreme

350
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,200
hypotheticals but what we want to do

351
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,540
here is to Showcase what happens uh what

352
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,980
are the results of of missing one

353
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,860
element over to two

354
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,480
so let's just say that we are you know

355
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,940
are on the up and up for processes uh

356
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,720
technology and kind of long people here

357
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160
what really happens here is that you

358
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,540
know we cannot adequately follow through

359
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,519
the technology that we have we have

360
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,139
implemented or the processes that we

361
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,380
have set up um set forth and people have

362
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,060
to will have to bounce between different

363
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,560
work streams and that look that's the

364
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,820
last thing you want you want people to

365
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,360
be focusing on you know a a single issue

366
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,940
or a few issues not too many and people

367
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,220
can be strained and overworked

368
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,040
and the output itself is optimal at this

369
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,880
point at this point in time

370
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,139
now the second hypothetical here so

371
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,639
let's just say that we have

372
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,060
a good team of people uh we haven't

373
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,320
implemented you know the processes right

374
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,019
for the life cycle of the phases as well

375
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,899
as the micro processes but we're lacking

376
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,540
in toolings and Technology

377
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,519
when it comes to you know processing a

378
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,040
huge amount of data that would be you

379
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,200
know it will become very painful in that

380
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,940
you know you're probably hand jamming

381
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,920
into an Excel sheet and then having all

382
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
these pivot tables right it takes a lot

383
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,639
of time although Excel is actually still

384
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,600
great

385
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,000
um I'm not jabbing it taking a jab at it

386
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,120
obviously uh but you know if when

387
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,500
compared to say like you actually have

388
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,240
well-defined you know scripts that can

389
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,339
help automate a lot of these parsings

390
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,920
um one would take a lot more time than

391
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,899
um than the other within the latter you

392
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:34,800
will

393
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,040
so additionally if we're trying to

394
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,560
disseminate uh for intelligence through

395
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,600
a non-automated process

396
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,399
it's not fun blasting emails to

397
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,839
everybody you know every single time you

398
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,579
finish intelligent products some might

399
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,500
think of getting a sort of centralized

400
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,079
knowledge of management or perhaps a

401
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,880
delivery like a CMS to deliver their

402
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,980
finish intelligence right so technology

403
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,899
does matter in terms of streamlining the

404
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,600
people in the process

405
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,040
so

406
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,480
let's just say that we have people we

407
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,040
have technology but we're kind of

408
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,839
lacking into the sort of implementation

409
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,240
or processes well

410
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,920
now you're talking about inconsistent

411
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,899
outcome right we're not following any

412
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,399
instructions here so we're kind of just

413
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,320
going you're just doing things on the

414
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
whim right especially when it comes down

415
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,279
to assess assessments and Analysis work

416
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,260
you need structured analying techniques

417
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,639
you need structured processes to help

418
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,860
with providing consistencies in your

419
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,779
assessments your confidence levels so on

420
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,440
so forth so without that your you know

421
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,980
your products your output is going to be

422
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,779
inconsistent and may actually impact you

423
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,060
know your either Superior posture or

424
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,500
your credibility as a finishing

425
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,600
intelligence provider right so processes

426
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,760
definitely matters

427
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,699
but overall to sum it all up you know we

428
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,399
have to think about people first right

429
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,680
create you know everything is without

430
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,360
people there are no processes there

431
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,920
there can be no technology that can be

432
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
actuated or actualized

433
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,380
okay so let's talk about demands the fun

434
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,620
part

435
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,940
so when we talk about demand in a in

436
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,980
this in the CTI sense we really are

437
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,320
talking about Intel requirements now

438
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,540
unlike traditional demand within you

439
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,079
know um most economic activity in CTI we

440
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,240
can actually have more direct control of

441
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,339
demand slash Intel requirements because

442
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,560
it is a essentially a contractual

443
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,139
agreement between the CTI team and your

444
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,360
leadership what can be supplied right

445
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,980
for their demand

446
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,220
um and additionally you know

447
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,240
we can also evaluate via the people uh

448
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,800
processing technology

449
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,560
uh to understand what Intel requirements

450
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,440
can we commit to right

451
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,899
um say an Intel requirement requires a

452
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,660
lot of uh people you know people to to

453
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,820
actually uh commit to uh maybe it is

454
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,980
tracking down a nation-state threat

455
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,620
actor right and uh your your you you

456
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,019
should spin up you know uh personas or

457
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,060
perhaps uh additional threat Hunters

458
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,619
right that's that's a lot of commitment

459
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,780
from people's side as well as processes

460
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,740
as well

461
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,319
so if you look at your current

462
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
organization

463
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
uh or at least your org chart can you

464
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,500
actually commit to that right maybe you

465
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,480
just have three people obviously you

466
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
wouldn't be able to directly

467
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,140
um track these you know uh threat actors

468
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,179
or these these groups right

469
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,099
um so be realistic obviously based on

470
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,220
what your current uh resources

471
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,500
now another thing that we want to do as

472
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,880
well is to periodically assess your

473
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,100
consumption of production

474
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,900
you know generally speaking on an annual

475
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,480
basis or perhaps a recurring basis what

476
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,039
are you producing what are you consuming

477
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,299
is it up to part is are your people

478
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,280
um are you do you have enough people to

479
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,799
to actually commit to all these demands

480
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,660
um and it's critical because oftentimes

481
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,380
we uh you know we are contractually

482
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,460
agreeing to demands that we want to

483
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,160
um sort of achieve and not what we can

484
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,020
achieve right so Canon one of two

485
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,700
different things we should always start

486
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,500
off with what we can achieve based off

487
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,720
of actual resources find our resources

488
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,080
and then moving on with what we want

489
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,059
then plan forward

490
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,880
so always keep that in mind right

491
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,520
because CTI operations does they do it

492
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
does not happen in a vacuum it requires

493
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,380
resources time uh financial resources

494
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,220
and people

495
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,100
Okay so

496
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,299
quick recap here

497
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,220
as I said no uh no charts here but we'll

498
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,799
do I'll go through some takeaways here

499
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,840
um the economics of CTI

500
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,520
through the lens of Economics principles

501
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,320
we can understand the scarcity of

502
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,720
resources that affects consumption and

503
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,799
production

504
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,020
and you know speaking consumption and

505
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,940
production they are two sides of the

506
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,260
same coin

507
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,419
um and when you flip a coin usually

508
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,660
usually one one side faces up right it

509
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,640
doesn't fall both uh to stand up

510
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,919
straight meaning you know commit to

511
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,539
either consumption or production

512
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,460
CTA Human Resources as I mentioned I

513
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,780
cannot consume produce at the same time

514
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,539
yep uh and you know use

515
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,539
people processing technology to evaluate

516
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,520
how much can you consume how much can

517
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,860
you produce

518
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,559
and then we should always think about

519
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:31,200
Intel requirements as demand

520
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,120
and assess whether

521
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,120
we can supply based on the current level

522
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,899
of resources

523
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,900
okay well with that

524
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,710
thank you

525
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,060
[Applause]

526
