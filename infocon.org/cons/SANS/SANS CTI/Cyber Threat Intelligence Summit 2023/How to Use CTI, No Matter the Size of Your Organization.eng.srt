1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,220
hi I'm Sydney Jones and I'm here to talk

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,860
to you about how to use CTI in various

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,380
size information security teams from

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,320
that one person doing infosec to 10 plus

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,140
people on a CTI team

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,840
so here's what we'll be covering I just

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,460
wanted to get through you know I've been

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,439
talking to other speakers here today in

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,019
the past and preparing for the summit on

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,480
different topics that are presented at

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,159
various intelligence Summits and

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,140
nobody's really talking about how to use

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,860
CTI in your various size teams and we do

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,899
a lot of discussions on how to

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,500
um

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,840
make and tailor your products for your

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,160
customers but we're not talking about

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,200
how to tailor your actual team

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,559
so here's what we'll be covering

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,620
a bit about myself so I lead the CTI

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,280
team at BNP pariba here in the US prior

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,980
to that I led a CTI program and another

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,160
large bank and also in an exchange I

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,660
also developed an external engagement

26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,540
program at my last firm and I have

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,680
several years in the Department of

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,439
Defense again as a CTI analyst and doing

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,600
intelligence policy advice

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,479
I also am in various uh committees

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:16,979
within the financial services

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,520
information sharing and Analysis Center

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
and co-chair of the critical

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,119
infrastructure subcommittee at the

35
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,560
intelligence and National Security

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,000
Alliance

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,680
and outside of all of that I find time

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,840
to have fun um so I am also an avid

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,220
sailor and Dancer

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,360
so let's start off with a couple of

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,799
questions I asked them to raise the

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,920
lights on this slide how many of you

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,979
think that any it department needs an

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,820
intelligence function

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,299
not as many as I thought okay I think

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,159
they do uh

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,200
but I also have been an intelligence

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,780
professional most of my career

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,759
um so I think it's really in how it's

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,100
used that is the best thing I don't

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,420
think we all need to be writing those

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,460
long-form intelligence reports that a

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,439
lot of speakers thought was what an

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,619
intelligence function did yesterday I

55
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,180
think we can do a little bit more of

56
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,239
information sharing within your company

57
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,099
and then the last couple of questions I

58
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,420
have and then you can bring lights back

59
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,560
down

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,500
um how many of you have CTI as one of

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,060
the many functions you're responsible

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,300
for

63
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,540
about five percent how many of you have

64
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,879
been that one person doing CGI the only

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
person

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
okay less than five percent okay that's

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,580
good that I guess more of you have

68
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,280
actually done CTI on a larger team

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,959
um so we'll be covering again like I

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,580
said from that one person kind of

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,459
macgyvering information security making

72
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,860
sure that the networks are up

73
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,319
um then going through like a smaller

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,660
medium-sized CTI team and then up to

75
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,120
that larger CTI team of like 10 plus

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,940
people I will be kind of building upon

77
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,860
each team so please don't kind of tune

78
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,599
out if you are in a bigger team don't

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
wait till the end to listen

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,319
um and then if you are on a smaller team

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,480
don't forget about what's coming up just

82
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
because this will give you some advice

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,739
on how you can mature your program and

84
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,959
kind of ask for more resources you'll

85
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,700
have the ability to tell them hey this

86
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,580
is what I can provide you in return for

87
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,080
those resources

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,819
that's it for my pull the audience

89
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,060
question

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,760
okay so what about that one person doing

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,800
information security

92
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,019
um my biggest advice that I will stop

93
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,420
here is to be a part of your sector's

94
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,000
information sharing and Analysis Center

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
or analysis organization your ifac and

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,340
eye style it's a big thing here within

97
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,019
the US and I've noticed that we have a

98
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,700
lot of people from other countries and

99
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,920
probably online they do have similar

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,319
programs outside of the us as well ready

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
spoke yesterday from the Nordic

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
Financial cert or cert I think it's one

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,620
of those Freddy how to talk yesterday so

104
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,360
go look for that

105
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,519
um there's also FSI Sac AS Global

106
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,040
there's a group in Israel as well and

107
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,720
I'm sure there's others that I am not

108
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,159
aware of

109
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,379
um So within the us there are 25

110
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,080
different eye sacs and eye styles that

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,879
are listed on the National Council of

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,339
isac's website so your sector is

113
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,320
probably a part of one

114
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,298
um what they do is they can give you a

115
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,639
lot of information specific to your

116
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,220
sector so you're not going to be

117
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,180
inundated with all of this information

118
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,100
that's out there about all the threats

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,380
that are going on globally it's kind of

120
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,139
narrowing it down for you

121
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,060
um and then also within your sector

122
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,740
they're going to have those smaller

123
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,020
groups so I would suggest that you reach

124
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,060
out to the membership director or

125
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,040
whoever your account representative is

126
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,220
for that ISAC and ask them hey this is

127
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,440
my Niche business within my sector and

128
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
that's what I'm trying to find out more

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,440
about

130
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,419
um within Finance which is where I have

131
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,000
spent a good chunk of my career the FSI

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,520
SEC has groups devoted to the broker

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,199
dealers insurance companies exchanges

134
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,520
and then any other kind of smaller

135
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,979
subsets and then for those of you who

136
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,780
might not know not everyone in finance

137
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,520
actually cares about credit card fraud

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,300
which for me is kind of a blessing

139
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,860
um it gives me a little bit more time to

140
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,960
focus in on other threats that I am

141
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,940
actually concerned about

142
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,740
um so it's within these groups that we

143
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,240
can kind of find out a little bit more

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,419
information and in my last company I

145
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,759
actually started a smaller group devoted

146
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,740
to the market segment

147
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,419
um so we were more concerned about our

148
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,220
smaller clients and how they could get

149
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,800
information specific to their firms and

150
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,600
their threats we thought if we could

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,220
help protect them and get them kind of

152
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,080
talking with each other about threats

153
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,699
that they're seeing it would actually

154
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,520
protect the market overall and keep the

155
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
sector as a whole or at least hopefully

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,960
as a whole more secure from those

157
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,639
threats

158
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,560
separately

159
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,900
um Within These isacs they also have

160
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,240
Regional focused groups so it's not

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
specific to your actual smaller

162
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
sub-sector but it can be based on where

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,440
you are located geographically so this

164
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,820
is instead of just going to their annual

165
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,340
Summit once a year seeing everybody and

166
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,320
getting you know a lot of fun out of it

167
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,120
you're actually meeting up quarterly

168
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,759
hopefully or more often and getting to

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,979
meet peers within your geographic area

170
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,960
so you can have those conversations

171
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,940
those smaller groups which is actually

172
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,860
really great

173
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,139
so that's kind of a lot about the ISAC I

174
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,419
really like the ISAC some people may not

175
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,180
but I think it's a good place to start

176
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,000
and then after that I would say even

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,520
beyond the US you can look at the Cecil

178
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,100
vulnerability catalog they actually post

179
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,500
a lot of updates on vulnerabilities that

180
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,960
are actively being exploited and they

181
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,400
updated on their website which I

182
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
actually made sure to put on the screen

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,699
which I hope is big enough for you guys

184
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,560
to read

185
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,780
um so that way if you're that one person

186
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,419
caring about literally everything going

187
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,520
on in your company you can kind of

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
prioritize your patching cycle based on

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,259
what's actively being exploited they

190
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,840
will actually also prepare monthly

191
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,300
summaries depending on your sector and

192
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,639
provide those as well saying hey within

193
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,620
your sector in the past month we've

194
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,720
noticed that even older vulnerabilities

195
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,060
are being exploited so you can go back

196
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,039
and make sure that your patching is up

197
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,259
to date if needed

198
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,120
and with all this information that's a

199
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
lot to come through so you may want to

200
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,680
talk to your firm about using either a

201
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,560
seam or a tip not my preference at the

202
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,240
size team but it's a lot for one person

203
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,740
to handle so if you have the budget it's

204
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,960
something you can consider

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
as far as outputs I really don't think

206
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,979
you're going to have time for any

207
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,720
intelligence help but you already have a

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,880
lot going on so just kind of help this

209
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,860
or use this information to help inform

210
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,780
your processes you already have in place

211
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,940
so for a smaller information security

212
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,860
team so a little bit bigger than one

213
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,740
person but still not that large kind of

214
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,720
pay attention to what we just talked

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
about but another way that you can kind

216
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,740
of help with that information and any

217
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,419
additional information you're looking at

218
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,319
externally is an open source aggregator

219
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,060
so I've been using the free version of

220
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,680
Feedly I know free tools are popular

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,699
here

222
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,160
um paid Feedly does have a paid version

223
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,039
but I've been using the free one for I

224
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,139
don't know how many years at this point

225
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,180
um I am actually putting in the sisa

226
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,340
information that we just talked about as

227
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,780
long as well as some FBI pins flashes in

228
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,520
the financial sector we get finra

229
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,860
notices about fishing campaigns that are

230
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,979
ongoing I'll have that in there and any

231
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,539
security blogs that I'm following

232
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,520
proofpoint just gave a talk listing

233
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,380
multiple different blogs that they are

234
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,720
citing so that's another thing that you

235
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,000
can add into your Feedly or any other

236
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
aggregator you choose to use and as well

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,519
as any news so that you like and I would

238
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,779
suggest that you kind of keep tweaking

239
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,940
this as it's needed you know if you're

240
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,040
interested in a paid version Beauty has

241
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,800
a paid version data Miner and sprinkler

242
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,040
are other options as well and for my

243
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,080
Twitter users if you still enjoy Twitter

244
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,380
I think tweet Tech is still available so

245
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,980
don't quote me on that but I hope it is

246
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,240
um and then some things you can also

247
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,880
monitor for are data and credential

248
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,080
leaks

249
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,300
um for this you can either use a paid

250
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,580
vendor or you can also check have I been

251
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,580
phoned or breached since to see if your

252
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,399
information's been out there

253
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,080
um what else do I have on here and then

254
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,760
ocent Frameworks I learned this in my

255
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,980
ocean class csans they have so many

256
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,360
things on that website that they

257
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,580
actually update so not only just for

258
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,860
this slide as well but future slides

259
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,200
that's a good a good resource to go back

260
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,459
and look at

261
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,279
and again still no additional outputs

262
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,380
that I'm asking you guys to do or even

263
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,000
try to do because you're still focused

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,620
on that broader information security

265
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,600
Mission you're really just going to be

266
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
looking to Monitor and detect anything

267
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,240
that you can

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
okay so we're at a CGI conference when

269
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,620
are we going to talk about CTI teams

270
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,300
um so this is the one I wanted to start

271
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,459
with so a small team of one to three

272
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,959
analysts

273
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,160
um there's a lot of external information

274
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,260
that I've just covered but I really

275
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,060
think that this is when you can start

276
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,820
focusing on your internal Telemetry and

277
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,320
tying in all of that external

278
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,959
information to what's internal this

279
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,480
would mean your sock data or any other

280
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,420
logs that you have access to and through

281
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,580
this you can start using the ISAC

282
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,860
information about phishing campaigns or

283
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,740
malware hits occurring in your sector

284
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,760
comparing it to see if you're having

285
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,060
similar issues going on at your firm

286
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,440
this is also when a tip would actually

287
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,200
come in quite handy because you can tie

288
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
in that external data to your internal

289
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,579
data and then if you're looking to do

290
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,500
malware analysis we talked about malware

291
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,959
analysis yesterday a couple of tools

292
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,380
would be abuse.ch

293
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,920
virustotal and hybrid analysis I also

294
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,899
put on here cert gadgets it was on the

295
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,640
ocean framework site so that's another

296
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,620
resource you could use

297
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,019
for your focus here it's going to be on

298
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,700
that operational lens and you're talking

299
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,600
about tactical operational and strategic

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,279
and your outputs I really want you to

301
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,420
start with those intelligence

302
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,860
requirements that we've talked about

303
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,500
throughout this conference an example

304
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,660
that I like to start off with as a big

305
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,760
intelligence requirement you know you're

306
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,019
only going to have like four to eight

307
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,700
overarching ones if you have more than

308
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,260
that it's going to be way too many for

309
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,540
you to think about so a big one that I

310
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,040
always start with when I go to a new

311
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,540
team is hey are we looking at

312
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,820
information related to a campaign

313
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,680
targeting us

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,040
or a peer that's very similar to us that

315
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,779
should be your main goal what are your

316
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,399
crown jewels and what are the threats

317
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,620
that are trying to get to that so that's

318
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,660
my advice for in regards to Intel

319
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,980
requirements

320
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,940
um and then you're going to use those

321
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,640
Intel requirements to create some type

322
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,040
of reporting or information that you're

323
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,320
sharing with other teams so I give you

324
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,600
some advice here for working with your

325
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,820
incident Response Team you're going to

326
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,380
look through those phishing metrics

327
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,640
you're going to look through the

328
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,500
phishing campaigns that are going on

329
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,019
within your ISAC channels kind of

330
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,000
comparing contrasting seeing if you're

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,560
seeing similar hits

332
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,079
don't just say be like hey we saw this

333
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
in FSI Sac here you go suck go see if we

334
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,220
have it you can actually go look for

335
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,380
that and then if you get a hit you can

336
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,060
pass it on to the stock for them to do

337
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,920
additional research and if there are no

338
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,260
hits you can just put it in your tip or

339
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,120
your scene and then it'll notify you if

340
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,640
you have something in the future

341
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,839
um for your vulnerability management

342
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
team again it goes back to that Cecil

343
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,980
alerts or any other reporting that

344
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,140
you're using for vulnerabilities you

345
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,360
want to let them know hey we saw this

346
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,160
vulnerability that's being patched but

347
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,019
it's actually actively being exploited

348
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,240
in our sector maybe that's the one that

349
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,519
you guys want to patch first

350
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,279
uh then I wanted to talk about exercises

351
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,040
and red teaming activities a lot of

352
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,500
people have a hard time understanding or

353
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,060
thinking through what should the red

354
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,700
team look to exercise or Implement so

355
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,279
you can provide the real world

356
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,420
intelligence about what's been going on

357
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,399
in the past few months past week past

358
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,440
year depending on how often they do

359
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,079
those exercises so an example that came

360
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,060
out last week is now we're now being

361
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,339
delivered via OneNote attachments so

362
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,899
that's something you may want to see if

363
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,660
your red team could exercise

364
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,760
and then if that's not enough if you

365
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,459
have time uh you can do some weekly

366
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,940
reports some teams of this size do

367
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,700
weekly reporting to their staff it can

368
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
be either technical or operational

369
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,600
reporting lines that you're reporting

370
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,399
those to so this would be external

371
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,440
intelligence that you're seeing and

372
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
trying to tie that back to your

373
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,160
intelligence requirements I'm not saying

374
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,920
do a summary of news articles please do

375
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,660
not do that otherwise they're going to

376
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,480
think that's all you do

377
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
so you're actually wanting to tie the

378
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,079
external intelligence back to your firm

379
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,779
so where's your firm operating where are

380
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,519
they looking to expand their business to

381
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,040
who are their clients are they operating

382
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,860
in a high risk operational area what are

383
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,959
the threats for that what are the threat

384
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,300
actors targeting your sector this week

385
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,319
that type of thing

386
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,920
uh for a mid-size CTI team this is

387
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,660
actually when you can start adding in

388
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,060
that strategic focus and focus on all

389
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,100
three aspects of intelligence that we've

390
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,680
talked about and your analysts can start

391
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
kind of deciding which one they might

392
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,519
like more interesting I'm a strategic

393
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,620
analyst but I love my tactical analysts

394
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,740
because they love the malware

395
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,320
yeah

396
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,760
um so some things that you can look for

397
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,160
as far as inputs if you have the budget

398
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,019
and I'm assuming if you have a team this

399
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,660
size you have a little bit more budget I

400
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,579
would suggest adding in a dark web

401
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,680
monitoring vendor so they can start

402
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,839
looking on the dark web seeing if

403
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,940
there's anything talking about thread

404
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,079
actors wanting to Target you

405
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,600
specifically or your type of firm so you

406
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,300
don't have to go out there nation state

407
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,880
or Espionage focused vendor is also

408
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
really helpful at this point

409
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,600
um and then if you don't have that money

410
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,180
at least for the nation-state vendors a

411
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,120
lot of them will provide log updates and

412
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,980
security blog updates as we mentioned

413
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,440
earlier on the larger activities that

414
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,940
they're seeing so you can at least kind

415
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,880
of add that into what your wanting to

416
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
report back to the firm if you want a

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,579
more powerful ocent aggregator like I

418
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,500
mentioned earlier this is another time

419
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
you could probably start adding that in

420
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,959
since you're going to have enough

421
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,480
analyst focusing on that

422
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,660
and then also a domain monitoring tool

423
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,000
so this is when you're trying to you

424
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,620
know look back through to see if

425
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,360
anyone's kind of doing your things to

426
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,399
your domains but then also when you're

427
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,920
trying to figure out hey we saw this

428
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,779
happening from such and such domain

429
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,279
where does that tie back into

430
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,399
infrastructure wise

431
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,399
as far as outputs you can do a lot more

432
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,440
on the sector Trends threats that you're

433
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,320
seeing sector-wide geopolitical events

434
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,880
and how that could impact your business

435
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,579
line or your bottom dollar and business

436
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,220
strategy are you looking to operate in a

437
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,820
new location are you looking to add in a

438
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,160
new line of business in finance a lot of

439
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,720
people want to add in crypto for some

440
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
reason

441
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,239
don't do it please don't

442
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,440
um you can also do some products with

443
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,820
your physical security and business

444
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,639
continuity teams as well so this would

445
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,440
be are there cyber threats that could

446
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,180
actually happen at the same time as a

447
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,800
physical disruption to one of your

448
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,440
locations or again you are looking to

449
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,720
expand into a high-risk operational area

450
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,120
whether the Cyber threats involved in

451
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,160
doing that

452
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,320
and then my personal favorite you could

453
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,600
start trying to do here is external

454
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,980
Partnerships

455
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,600
um this would just be an additional duty

456
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,480
if someone has some time maybe one or

457
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,800
two analysts and what do I mean by

458
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,079
external Partnerships I'm a big

459
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,480
proponent of having relationships with

460
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,860
your local law enforcement and

461
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,639
government entities prior to an incident

462
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,919
so I know that a lot of people aren't

463
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,500
really sure where to start but it's a

464
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,240
good thing to kind of get to know who

465
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,099
those people are you can also start

466
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,079
building more one-on-one trusted

467
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,959
relationships within your sector so

468
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,819
again like I said do this prior to an

469
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,439
incident you don't want to be dealing

470
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,299
with a ransomware attack and trying to

471
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,559
figure out who to call

472
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,119
you want to already know who they are

473
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,240
like hey dude yeah it was great seeing

474
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,620
you last week by the way I need your

475
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,299
help you know you want to have that

476
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,919
relationship already

477
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,039
and it's also good use for intelligence

478
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,419
collection because you already have

479
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,160
those relationships and someone might

480
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,440
tell you hey we're seeing XYZ activity

481
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,600
before they even put it in an ISAC

482
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,940
then for a larger team of analysts

483
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,799
coming from the government and into a

484
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,900
large multinational Bank

485
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,760
I kind of used to think this is what a

486
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,220
CTI team wants I've learned over the

487
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,320
years this is not a CGI team in most

488
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,600
places it is usually you know the

489
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,440
Fortune 100 Banks or 100 companies for

490
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,360
the government or security vendors that

491
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,340
have the science team but if you are

492
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,980
fortunate enough I guess fortunate

493
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,860
enough to work for one of them this is

494
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,520
some advice for your size team again I'm

495
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
assuming at this point you're going to

496
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,100
have a lot of budget because you're

497
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,200
going to have this many people so you're

498
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,700
going to look at some specialized

499
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,200
vendors and what do I mean by

500
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,200
specialized so some firms are actually

501
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,140
building specific teams for specific

502
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,260
threats and that's going beyond your

503
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,000
strategic threats they're looking at hey

504
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,860
we've seen a lot in the supply chain

505
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,080
sector we're really concerned about that

506
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,539
so let's look for some vendors that can

507
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,120
help us explore that option or in the

508
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,000
cryptocurrency world or blockchain chain

509
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,980
analysis really is really great and

510
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,539
useful for people who are concerned

511
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,480
about that but you can also double up on

512
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
your vendors so if you have a specific

513
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
region that you're focused on some

514
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,299
vendors are better at focusing on

515
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,400
certain regions so you can add in a

516
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,860
vendor that's focusing on that

517
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,980
uh some firms of the size are also very

518
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,600
concerned about brand protection and

519
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
what do I mean by that you're concerned

520
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,100
about how your brand is seen online or

521
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,900
if there are scams implicating your

522
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,880
brand without your permission so you're

523
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,140
looking for tools that will be

524
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,559
monitoring for new domains that pop up

525
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,419
impersonating your brand social media

526
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,980
accounts that are impersonating your

527
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,039
brand or possibly your c-suite and I'm

528
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,419
not just talking about deep baits

529
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,460
um and then when we get into ex your

530
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,080
outputs it's still going to be the same

531
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,760
recording lines but you're going to add

532
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
in a little bit more because you're

533
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,360
going to have those more Niche teams so

534
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,760
your supply chain cell that some firms

535
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,559
have you're going to need to be working

536
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,059
with your third-party risk management

537
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,400
team as an example and the relationship

538
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,679
managers for those vendors you're going

539
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,840
to be talking to them regularly talking

540
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,460
to them about the threats you're seeing

541
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,380
all these data breaches that keep

542
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,840
happening to our vendors these days I

543
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,600
don't know how many I've seen in the SSI

544
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
stack realm this month I it's been a lot

545
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,039
of just vendors that we were concerned

546
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,419
about

547
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,919
um and then you know they're going to

548
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,600
build those reporting lines specifically

549
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,139
for that

550
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
and oh the other one I had was

551
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,100
cryptocurrency because again I work in

552
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
finance there are cells that are

553
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,580
actually very much concerned in the

554
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,679
thefts of cryptocurrency and monitoring

555
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,799
those threat actors on a daily basis

556
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,960
and then again external engagement I

557
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,100
think at this point you can actually

558
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,440
have that one person who's focused on it

559
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,140
maybe too full time and that's going

560
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,940
Beyond just the relationship with law

561
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,039
enforcement this is you know building

562
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,600
those relationships with the

563
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,179
cross-sector engagements of you know

564
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,980
everyone is dependent on energy and

565
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,720
telecommunication I don't care what

566
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,120
sector and you're dependent on that for

567
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,559
your business so you're kind of building

568
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,960
those relationships across your isax

569
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
through the you know different

570
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,220
cross-eyes hack channels you're finding

571
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,080
other information sharing groups that

572
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,580
you can talk to you're talking to

573
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,260
Academia you're talking to other

574
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,600
government sectors you're talking Beyond

575
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,539
US government or your local government

576
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,340
um so anyways that can be a whole other

577
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,919
talk in and of itself so if you want to

578
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,480
talk to me about external engagement you

579
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,140
can see me after

580
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,160
okay so I've given you a lot of

581
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,799
information hopefully it was enough for

582
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,960
you guys to absorb but I want you to

583
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,940
think of some questions before I show

584
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,580
you a summary slide

585
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,600
where are you now in regards to CTI

586
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,179
and where do you want to be

587
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,440
and how can you get there

588
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,280
so I hope that this talk gave you some

589
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
ideas of how you can kind of mature your

590
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,020
team and some things that you can do to

591
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,580
convince your management of why you need

592
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,440
more resources or when you get those

593
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,539
resources that you'll be able to provide

594
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,460
them better outputs

595
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,260
I had meant to tell you I was going to

596
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,940
give you a summary slide of everything

597
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,980
but here's a summary slide of everything

598
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,720
if you want to take a picture of this

599
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,140
before the slides are off

600
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,740
and please don't do this all on your own

601
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,710
right and with that again not malware

602
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,060
[Applause]

603
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,010
