1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,820
the Genesis of what I'm going to talk

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,620
about today really comes from a number

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,360
of different sources one is my own

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,799
interest in this I've been I've been

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,560
breeding studying this for you know 15

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,180
20 years

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,699
the other is uh popular media is really

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,380
kind of starting to color our

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,359
understanding of of Russian organized

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,400
crime and and essentially now they are

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,980
the boogeyman of all the new movies you

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,920
know you think back equalizer John Wick

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,860
John Wick 2 you know uh some of the

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,540
other ones nobody they're all Russian

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,120
organized crime actors and third is kind

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,980
of kind of a service understanding of we

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,840
we tend to think maybe

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,480
attribution Wise It's Russia or it's

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,480
crime or it's an apt group out of Russia

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
there's a lot more Nuance to it that's

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,360
really colored in large part by the

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,760
history of Russian based organized crime

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,000
uh and uh this is gonna we're gonna see

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,039
this constant theme of how this builds

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,619
over over really the last 150 years but

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,119
before we get into that I'll just

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,920
introduce myself formally Jerry Johansen

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,960
I'm on the incident handling team at Red

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,400
Canary and I work in Readiness around

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,740
detection or response

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,600
um prior to my time at ranking area I've

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,460
been in in Enterprise and Consulting for

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,720
about 10 years working detection

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,240
response and Intel and prior to that

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,520
spent 10 years in law enforcement as an

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,560
investigator in cyber crime at the state

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,020
and federal level and I'm based out of

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,540
Rapid City South Dakota anybody any

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,960
South dakotans here tonight no sorry uh

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,579
if you're up there for Wild West hacking

42
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,479
Fest drop me a line

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,860
we're going to discuss why we're

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,060
actually talking about this why are we

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,579
going to go into the nuances of

46
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,560
russian-based organized crime and I say

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,740
russian-based organized crime because uh

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,500
rbsc or Russian organized crime is a

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,700
global phenomenon if you are looking at

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,979
say you know our understanding the

51
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,040
Italian mafia it has some ties back to

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,920
Italy but it is not a global institution

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,720
that the way we see russian-based

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,220
organized crime

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,000
and when we start to dig deep we're

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
going to go into the history and then

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,720
look at where we are today russian-based

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,140
organized crime and how that actually

59
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,060
informs our understanding of the Cyber

60
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,940
threat that is related to russian-based

61
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,739
organized crime I'll kind of summarize

62
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,560
some things uh give you the the bad news

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,500
worst news scenario of where we are and

64
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,700
where we're going with this

65
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,640
the scale is the big thing the scale of

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,379
russian-based organized crime and cyber

67
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,780
crime in particular is staggering and it

68
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,180
is one of the few

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,060
um outside of Apt groups that we see

70
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,239
this scale in terms of organized

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,760
criminal activity in cyberspace there

72
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,739
are plenty of other organizations out

73
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,920
there from the cartels to gangs to other

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,019
organized crime but nobody compares to

75
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,060
how the russian-based organized crime

76
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,280
groups operate their scope of it and

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,980
fear of the sphere of influence so it's

78
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,800
a huge huge problem across Europe even

79
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
into the United States

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,540
it's also very hard to pin down from an

81
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,040
attribution standpoint where we're

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,720
talking cyber

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,300
is this a criminal organization that's

84
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,940
doing this is it a state-sponsored

85
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,360
criminal organization or is it a what I

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,940
would say is a state criminal Enterprise

87
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,400
and that kind of informs what we may

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,940
have to start looking at moving forward

89
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,159
the big thing to take away is we're

90
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,000
going to look at some of the

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,860
relationships between russian-based

92
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,260
organized crime cyber crime and their

93
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,680
proxy for Russian intelligence services

94
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,720
and this is not a casual relationship as

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,799
we're going to see we're going to see

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,500
some some serious integration here again

97
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,299
going back to that attribution problem

98
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,879
is how do we determine where this fits

99
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,620
is it a state-sponsored or is it a

100
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,060
criminal Enterprise

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,519
and right now we're seeing a lot of

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,580
support for uh the war in Ukraine you

103
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,439
know this really kind of changed the

104
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,939
atmosphere in the last year and has

105
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,500
really kind of colored some of the

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,879
aspects to what we're going to be

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,298
discussing

108
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,079
I'm going to give you a brief history

109
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,358
though because a lot of what we're

110
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,020
seeing today is colored in the last 100

111
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,720
plus years we tend to think of

112
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,400
russian-based organized crime as an

113
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,979
issue with the rise of Vladimir Putin

114
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,100
for example but this issue how it

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,660
integrates with the government and

116
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,860
culture of Russia goes well well before

117
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,120
1999 and as we're going to discuss

118
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,340
we can really start to trace the

119
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,960
elements all the way back to about the

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,340
1850s 1860s so mid 19th century this is

121
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,139
rapid industrialization across Europe

122
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,840
and even in the United States so rapid

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,300
industrialization brings a lot of people

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,699
into a concentrated area

125
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,740
so if you're a fan of movies and you've

126
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,660
seen Gangs of New York

127
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,940
or read the book this is essentially

128
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,120
what is being replicated in Russia where

129
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,680
in the United States we had rapid

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
industrialization in New York City it

131
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,180
brought a lot of people together and it

132
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,160
became basically a breeding ground for

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
criminal activity

134
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,180
but the criminal activity starts to

135
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,800
become specialized so you have people

136
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,199
that are that are specifically good at

137
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,960
pickpocketing others that will just Club

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,699
you over the head and take your wallet

139
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,020
but we're starting to see this

140
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,460
specialization

141
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,860
and with the specialization becomes a

142
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,919
criminal subculture and this is where we

143
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,919
see the Thieves World uh caveat I am not

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,320
a Russian speaker so I believe it's the

145
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,199
worst guy near which is the Thieves

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
World so it is a Loosely Affiliated

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,060
group of individuals that are committing

148
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,160
mostly property and violent crime with

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,020
the intent of getting money that's

150
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,680
basically their their uh modus operandi

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,960
to use a technical term

152
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,419
and then you start to see a hierarchy

153
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,240
build where money goes up to people to

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,280
get support and to operate into into

155
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,380
individual areas

156
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,180
one of the notable people to come out of

157
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,400
this area is Joseph Stalin who's a bank

158
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,479
robber and he actually starts the next

159
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,520
phase in this when he takes power in

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,020
1924

161
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,220
one of the aspects to his regime was the

162
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,400
wholesale uh imprisonment in the gulags

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
the gulag archipelago of criminals and

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
other uh other individuals within the

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,720
the society that he deemed uh deviant or

166
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,340
you know for whatever politically

167
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,720
inconvenient I think is a good way to

168
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,160
put it

169
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,500
this concentration leads to more

170
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,539
organization this is something that

171
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,000
happens even even today when we start to

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,280
lock a lot of individuals up you see

173
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,160
gangs form and those gangs start to

174
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,660
become more highly organized because

175
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,340
they have nothing better to do than to

176
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,259
organize themselves

177
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,220
this leads to beforey which is the

178
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,500
thieves in law and what that essentially

179
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,860
means is a code of conduct is now built

180
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,680
around being a member of Russian Russian

181
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,000
organized crime or russian-based

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,319
organized crime and this still carries

183
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,380
over till today but the uh the Visa law

184
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,440
is a written code and it dictates your

185
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,139
behavior as a member of the criminal

186
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,300
underworld

187
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,860
one of the other more public

188
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,720
displays in terms of iconography if you

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
look up there is the the actual tattoos

190
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,500
this is one of the things you'll see a

191
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,660
lot in the movies where you know our

192
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,720
antagonist is a is a Russian Russian

193
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,880
gangster is the tattoos

194
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,419
we see codes of conduct we see an entire

195
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,180
subculture being built here and this is

196
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,020
all based around criminal activity

197
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,300
with this organization the big takeaway

198
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,580
from this is a hierarchy starts to be

199
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,280
built about who's in charge

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,860
who owns what relationship there's a

201
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,660
rigid hierarchy that is built because

202
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,400
that becomes important as we start to

203
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,500
see how that adapts later on

204
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,979
Stalin Stalin dies in 1953 and Nikita

205
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,039
Khrushchev who is then the premier

206
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,780
releases everybody back out onto the

207
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,539
onto the streets so here's the here's

208
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,979
the perfect sauce that's just been

209
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,199
created they have spent literally 23

210
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
years building up a subculture with

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,779
codes of conduct and organization and

212
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,360
now they're back on the streets

213
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
starting in 1960s carrying over into the

214
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,380
70s and 80s is uh widespread shortages

215
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,500
of high-end and luxury goods within the

216
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,760
Soviet Union

217
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,620
where you have a where you have a black

218
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,540
market you have organized crime

219
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,580
organized crime comes in starts running

220
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,260
the black market

221
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,060
there's a high level of competition

222
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,200
between each of these Rory groups that

223
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,180
are fighting this out to the point where

224
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,480
they're having running Street Wars but

225
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,519
the other Major Impact that this has is

226
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,620
the worries start to establish

227
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,720
relationships with those that can afford

228
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,300
the black market Goods which are the

229
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,380
political military and intelligence

230
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,880
higher-ups these are the people that

231
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,519
will make use and can get away with

232
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,160
black market Goods

233
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,800
so there is this beginning of this

234
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,980
period the intertwining of the glory and

235
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,440
the Soviet political and Military and

236
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,620
intelligence uh executive class if you

237
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,959
want to say that this becomes important

238
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,700
later on because this is where we start

239
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,040
to see the relationships in the 60s 70s

240
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,560
and 80s that will carry us over to a

241
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,779
current state right here

242
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,360
this exact this is exacerbated in the

243
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
1980s where we start to see a lot more

244
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,060
loosening of the restrictions in the

245
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,760
Soviet Union it just increases that you

246
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
know think of it as a bacteria we're

247
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,260
just putting in a nice warm dark spot so

248
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,760
it can keep growing and growing and

249
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,120
growing

250
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,720
1991 92 Soviet Union collapses and this

251
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,580
creates chaos this is really the

252
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,860
defining moment that we start to see the

253
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,839
modern

254
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,860
russian-based organized crime and

255
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,140
russian-based cyber crime really start

256
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,240
to

257
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,820
consolidate power and gain a lot of

258
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,480
legitimacy

259
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,680
with those controls a whole bunch of

260
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,200
chaos reins and essentially what happens

261
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,779
is those that were

262
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,060
organized crime figures at the senior

263
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,200
leadership level start to take positions

264
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,180
within the government and major

265
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,880
Enterprise so for example the Soviet

266
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,459
Union they had nationalized the entire

267
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,279
oil production and then as soon as the

268
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,360
Soviet Union collapses then

269
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,459
individuals then take over the oil

270
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,260
production so for example if you were

271
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,940
looking at this and you are a fan of

272
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,980
Sopranos imagine Tony Soprano one day

273
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,860
starts to run mobile

274
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,440
that's essentially what's what is going

275
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,040
on with this chaos

276
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,200
these these individuals come in take

277
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,180
control they're actually called thieves

278
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,399
in Authority so there is a additional

279
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,680
layer of people with legitimate

280
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,320
jobs running multi-billion dollar

281
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,240
organizations

282
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,459
the other thing is

283
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,040
um and and it was covered yesterday when

284
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,959
Drew was talking about this adaptability

285
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,660
model the RB the russian-based organized

286
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,000
crime decides to shed that and become

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,940
more adaptable so whereas prior to this

288
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,800
you would have organized crime groups

289
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,320
that would be in competition with each

290
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,420
other now they are essentially Loosely

291
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,420
affiliated with individuals shifting not

292
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,579
really alliances but working more on a

293
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,380
task organization this interview will go

294
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,180
here for six months and work on

295
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,440
something this individual will go over

296
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
here so there's a much more adaptable

297
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,240
and and less of this hierarchy and

298
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,640
keeping everybody within specific silos

299
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,200
so where are we today the modern era

300
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,579
really starts

301
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,300
in about 1999 and Vladimir Putin Rises

302
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,680
to power

303
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,860
if you're maybe not up on Vladimir Putin

304
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,839
he was one of these individuals that

305
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,920
came out of the intelligence Community

306
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,860
he was KGB officer and he already had

307
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,200
connections in the 90s being a local

308
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,180
politician with some of these

309
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,600
individuals and what you see is the

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,180
emergence of a conditional understanding

311
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,519
that Russia now had a nationalized

312
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,600
underworld

313
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,940
what does that mean and the reason I

314
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,740
read that off is that is one of the key

315
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,360
key aspects here

316
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,540
in the 1990s to contrast that where the

317
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,160
United States was in terms of organized

318
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,620
crime they we do not have the

319
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,660
nationalized power of organized crime or

320
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,000
cartel groups in the United States the

321
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,880
way that Russia post-soviet has where

322
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,079
essentially

323
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,260
the vory those that are are part of this

324
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,740
world uh Bankers our Bankers economists

325
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,920
government officials phds and yes cyber

326
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
individuals people that are highly

327
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,180
skilled in computer crime

328
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,860
so this is where the Russian business

329
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,779
network if you're familiar with that in

330
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,279
in about 2006 2007 really starts to uh

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,700
starts to become part of this operating

332
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,200
model

333
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,620
and the major challenge that we have is

334
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,899
cyber cyber criminal groups operate with

335
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,339
impunity

336
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,339
and they have those informal and even

337
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,519
Formal Connections that allows them to

338
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,320
actually carry out their operation

339
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,560
Without Really any fear of prosecution

340
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,980
another quick side note for example uh

341
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,899
this the Russian government in the

342
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,459
United States government do not have a

343
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,800
extradition treaty so

344
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,899
these individuals we're going to look at

345
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,899
some specifics are really under no fear

346
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,639
of being extradited to the United States

347
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,940
for uh crimes that they commit here

348
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,160
such as the colonial pipeline or or any

349
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,660
of the other ransomware attacks

350
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,279
in criminology there's a concept called

351
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
harm capacity and when we're looking at

352
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,019
organized crime or or other organized

353
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,779
entities like cartels and gangs we look

354
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,360
at their harm capacity and what that

355
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,120
essentially means is you know how much

356
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,339
can they actually do how much impact can

357
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,160
they have on the culture how much impact

358
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,139
can they have on individuals within the

359
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,339
society

360
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,980
so a real quick breakdown what we're

361
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,540
dealing with right now are highly

362
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,279
sophisticated and highly sophisticated

363
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,620
at basically every level

364
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,560
whereas you might see in a cartel there

365
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,519
are some highly sophisticated

366
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,279
individuals at the very top but as you

367
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,839
start to work your way down they become

368
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,720
less and less able to actually carry out

369
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,519
criminal activity on a sophisticated

370
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,440
level they're basically brutes they're

371
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,459
muscle

372
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,680
whereas russian-based organized crime

373
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,199
has this sophistication level really all

374
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,519
the way up and down

375
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,320
this also

376
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
ties directly into their cyber

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
capability they're very as as probably

378
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
we are all aware they're highly

379
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,360
sophisticated in terms of their cyber

380
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,540
there is a in fact an era legitimacy

381
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,899
and this often comes from

382
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,720
the chaos of the 1990s is a lot of

383
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,639
individuals had to leave their

384
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,019
government jobs because there was no

385
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,500
money to pay them so they see that

386
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,440
working for a russian-based organized

387
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,639
crime element

388
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,420
is actually a legitimate uh a legitimate

389
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,940
job and that will pay them

390
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,579
technically proficient computer science

391
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:57,120
mba's phds again level sophistication is

392
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,220
is staggering compared to other

393
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,440
organized crime groups that that have

394
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
appeared and disappeared in the last

395
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
hundred years

396
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,779
those deep political connections

397
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,480
essentially makes them immune from any

398
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,579
type of consequence for what they're

399
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,019
what they're doing and the operations

400
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,760
that they're conducting

401
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,720
and there is a lot of cooperation with

402
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,060
the intelligence community and and

403
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,740
russian-based organized crime which

404
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,480
really puts them

405
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,579
so far ahead of any other organization

406
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:27,959
imagine

407
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,260
for example Tony Soprano and his North

408
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,139
Jersey crew uh meeting with the CIA

409
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,019
director of the CIA or senior leadership

410
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,120
at the CIA or the NSA that is

411
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,920
essentially what russian-based organized

412
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,240
crime has right now

413
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,940
so cyber

414
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,680
how does this all fit in

415
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,199
this is a really good quote I'll

416
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,480
actually show some of the the sources

417
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,860
that I use for this it actually comes

418
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,500
out of one of these but uh it is

419
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,899
essentially going back to that that

420
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,260
technical sophistication and capability

421
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,160
is you had a lot of out of work or low

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,559
prospects for work some very talented

423
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,280
very intelligent individuals and this is

424
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,859
a way to make a lot a lot a lot of money

425
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,980
very quickly with very little risk of

426
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,000
actually going to jail

427
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,679
so for example evil Corp this is

428
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,419
probably one of the most egregious like

429
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,880
out there there is no doubt their

430
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,700
connection to the Russian intelligence

431
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,059
Services specifically the FSB

432
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,940
um anybody familiar with Maxim

433
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,799
take your booties okay that's yakubats

434
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,080
um just a quick history on evil Corp uh

435
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,000
do some breeding uh looks like the you

436
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
know dry decks moving into raspberry

437
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,220
Robin uh this is one of those things

438
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,860
that uh we see also talking about Drew

439
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,080
and their ability to shift and and move

440
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,720
around tools techniques kind of keep

441
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,039
ahead of them

442
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,140
again this is probably the most

443
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,840
egregious example I've seen uh of this

444
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,240
type of cooperation

445
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,380
um

446
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,480
the real crime is a paint job on the

447
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,860
Lamborghini but uh

448
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,500
we have we have Maxim here on the left

449
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,780
with his

450
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,880
paint job we'll put it that way in the

451
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,940
middle is his wife who he married

452
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,200
her father is Edward now Edward uh is a

453
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,120
TV personality a former FSB uh

454
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,400
uh executive he was an officer in the

455
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,820
FSB and he actually runs a

456
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,620
paramilitary or private military

457
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,220
Contracting firm uh called vemple

458
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,900
and uh this is literally the most

459
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,240
egregious that that I can see in terms

460
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,299
of the connect direct connection there's

461
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,480
images of Edward at the wedding uh

462
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,840
hanging out just you know at just you

463
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,240
would normally go to a wedding and her

464
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,059
his daughter is marrying the head of one

465
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,160
of the largest uh ransomware groups out

466
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,280
there

467
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,179
Conti is another one

468
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,179
um now defunct uh talking you know

469
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,720
referencing Drew's talk uh yesterday in

470
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,580
terms of splitting into uh the royal

471
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,900
ransomware

472
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,299
this is a well-funded and connected

473
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,340
group but you know again there was

474
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,900
another discussion about the content

475
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,720
leads uh shows the potential for FSB

476
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,080
funding there was actually uh there was

477
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,380
actually a requests for breached data

478
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,900
so here is kind of where we look at this

479
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,980
from a perspective of attribution is a

480
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,760
ransomware group actually hits something

481
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,960
a Target

482
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,419
and it may not have been at the

483
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,760
direction of the FSB but now we're

484
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,320
looking at there is an existing

485
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,039
relationship so they can actually

486
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,160
work through that see what they have and

487
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,220
maybe call up their buddy at the FSB who

488
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,020
they know through a criminal Network

489
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,360
criminal underground and essentially

490
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,539
offer up that information so there's a

491
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,480
much more deeper level of cooperation as

492
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,419
a two-way street

493
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,580
as opposed to what we see here where to

494
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,460
get criminals to give up any information

495
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,440
we'd have to we'd have to squeeze them

496
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,539
with prison time or whatnot there is

497
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,400
this two-way street

498
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,539
we also see conti and we are seeing

499
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,179
hacktivist groups and cyber criminals

500
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,580
actually taking part in cyber operations

501
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,840
and support of the war in Ukraine again

502
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,720
this is all kind of the same stew versus

503
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,419
the cyber crime cyber criminals are

504
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,160
allowed to operate no they are

505
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,380
essentially

506
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,980
maybe even Advanced towards taking some

507
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,380
sort of geopolitical stance as part of

508
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,020
their relationship with uh the Intel

509
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,059
community and and there's and their

510
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,760
status as criminals within Russia Today

511
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,380
Dark Side anybody see the the Rival

512
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,260
Roundup the video the the cops pushing

513
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,660
in the pushing in the door this was a

514
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,419
high profile arrest uh right before

515
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,419
everything was going down in Ukraine the

516
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,200
FSB decided to do a Roundup and included

517
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,679
a dark side member in that

518
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,360
the missing piece is what actually

519
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,820
happened to these individuals so this

520
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,059
might signal uh I'm gonna you know

521
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,460
Hazard to guess might signal some sort

522
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,260
of in the front or the police station

523
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,460
out out the back

524
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,020
this is also that portability and that

525
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,299
and that uh that Drew talked about

526
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:52,919
yesterday is

527
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,679
take one down all of the criminal

528
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,480
elements scatter they go work for other

529
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,880
groups all with the all with the

530
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,679
understanding that this is all part of

531
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,419
the game when we're talking uh you know

532
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:07,860
russian-based organized crime

533
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,900
the very I talked about the Glenn

534
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,200
picture the very very little sliver of

535
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,500
Hope is uh I believe the name of the

536
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,000
company was chain analysis was actually

537
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,820
able to pull back some of the funds from

538
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,799
the colonial pipeline attack

539
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
so there is some

540
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,140
a little glimmer of hope in this group

541
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,380
in particular because

542
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,500
organized crime operates for the sake of

543
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,179
gathering money that's it that's all

544
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,679
they do that's what they're there for is

545
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,419
they're consolidating that's that skill

546
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,059
and sophistication to grab some cash

547
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,220
if you can interfere or Trace that that

548
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,620
follow the money routine that actually

549
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,460
can help a great deal

550
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,100
so we'll round it up here

551
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,220
if we look back 150 years in terms of

552
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,840
the relationship with the Russian

553
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
government

554
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,799
this is a feature it's not a bug this is

555
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,840
the way that their government operates

556
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,260
in terms of a relationship between

557
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,280
organized crime

558
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,100
cyber organized crime the Intel services

559
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,919
and the political leadership

560
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,400
what this does for us is it there's a

561
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,580
significant overlap that we're seeing

562
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,980
here we talked about Intel services and

563
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,679
cyber criminals you know evil court is

564
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,059
probably the most egregious I'm sure

565
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,919
Maxim can pick up the phone at any time

566
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,200
and get the FSB on the phone the FSB can

567
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
and return the favor

568
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,880
this makes attribution very difficult

569
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,539
this is really one of the the reasons to

570
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:43,260
maybe look at this as a more nuanced and

571
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,440
more uh or I should say less clear-cut

572
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,460
than criminal apt group again that kind

573
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,539
of state criminal Enterprise

574
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
they are highly flexible and don't

575
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,659
maintain a rigid affiliation and

576
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,159
hierarchy the way that we would

577
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,440
traditionally think of organized crime

578
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,039
and uh this was covered extensively by

579
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,080
Drew Drew yesterday with those drafts

580
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,659
showing hey this is how they move in and

581
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,059
out of this space and actually are able

582
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,140
to

583
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,539
disband and reconstitute themselves

584
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,820
somewhere else

585
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,539
and most likely developing that from an

586
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,460
existing model of what russian-based

587
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,080
organized crime was doing in the 1990s

588
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,600
up and up until today

589
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,340
as I said we have no extradition

590
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,320
treaties so there is very little to do

591
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,360
in terms of cooperation and we've also

592
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,400
seen that cooperation diminish a lot

593
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,919
with the current state of the world

594
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,840
but I will leave you this

595
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,159
from an assessment standpoint

596
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,020
russian-based organized crime and their

597
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,539
cyber crime Affiliates

598
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,480
um I I submit they inhabit a gray area

599
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,320
they're part State and part criminal and

600
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,659
at that point you know all bets are off

601
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,039
and maybe we have to think about this

602
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,740
from from a different perspective

603
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,860
I've included some resources uh in the

604
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,380
slide deck in terms of of books articles

605
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,120
everything like that

606
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,380
um you know if you're if you want to

607
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,659
reference anything and really want to

608
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,400
study a little bit more

609
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,780
um that's right there

610
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,220
so thank you very much

611
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,699
foreign
