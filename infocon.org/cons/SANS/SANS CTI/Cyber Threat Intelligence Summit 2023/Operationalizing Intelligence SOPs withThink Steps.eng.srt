1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,380
who started public speaking during the

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,760
pandemic since it's actually my first

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,679
in-person talk

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,260
um thank you

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,640
um one of the things that I don't get to

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,800
do a lot with virtual talks is involve

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,779
the audience so I am going to be asking

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,340
you questions throughout so I hope you

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,880
enjoy that my first question is how many

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,420
in the room know what Sops are

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,340
okay almost everyone in the room so if

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,480
you're not familiar with that's a piece

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,820
standard operating procedures how many

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,399
in the room think that you have the

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,100
perfect Sops definitely up to date

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,160
definitely centrally located

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
okay this talk is for you I was hoping

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,840
there would be like one person that

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,860
would raise their hand and I can make

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,180
fun of throughout the talk but it's okay

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,840
I have Rick

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,219
um

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,820
okay so I'm gonna introduce who I am

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,079
um then I'm going to talk a little bit

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,440
about cognitive science uh hat tip to Dr

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,080
Chris because I'm a huge fan of his and

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,000
I always also like to include some type

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,340
of cognitive science to my talks then

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm going to talk about the state of

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,299
current intelligence Sops and some of

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,979
the challenges that I have seen working

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,740
in the field and then the impact of

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,320
having poor Sops or just not having sfps

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,920
at all and then I'm going to

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,740
um introduce something that I found when

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,640
I

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,700
um did my last talk at the 2020 sand CTI

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,400
Summit I introduced my framework and one

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,960
of the parts of the framework was think

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,759
steps and I'm going to give you some

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,100
examples about how to use think steps in

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,200
a not only for your CTI investigations

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,740
but also to improve your Sops and then

45
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,060
I'm going to give you some tips on how

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,720
to operationalize uh not only my idea

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,820
but just generally tips to help you with

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,220
your Sops and then I'm gonna hopefully

49
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,500
if I have time do a quick summary and

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,659
maybe some questions

51
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,920
so I just started last week at Cisco

52
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,979
Talus I'm very happy to be on the team

53
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,780
as a cyber security research analyst and

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,959
writer I'm also the author of the

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,220
children's book series The Mighty

56
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,739
intelligence Warrior you'll see her on

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,440
the screen and all her glory you might

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,300
see characters from my books throughout

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,860
the presentation

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,260
um just because I could

61
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,780
um I'm uh also the creator of the

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,760
cognitive stairways of analysis which

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,860
you can go back and watch that talk from

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,800
the 2020 CTI Summit or if you want to

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
know more about it in my book or that

66
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,700
talk you could go onto my blog on

67
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,120
perthuntergirl.com and at heart I'm a

68
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,459
tactical intelligence junkie I like to

69
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,220
be as far in the weeds as possible

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,440
um and I'm not a regular Mom I'm a cool

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,840
mom

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,239
and I'm also a massive Lego fan I

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,980
actually have a Lego city that I built

74
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,739
during the pandemic I have not named it

75
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,360
um so if you have any ideas please let

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,099
me know

77
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,959
so let's talk about the process of sense

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,599
making uh Dr Chris had talked about it

79
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,580
in his keynote which I was very excited

80
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,920
about but this is basically how our

81
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
brains make sense of the world around us

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,000
and

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,260
um

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,780
when our brain experiences an event it

85
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,180
collects data about that event and it

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,920
looks through like our Rolodex of

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,599
schemas that it's already created to see

88
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,940
do we need to make a new schema do we

89
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,180
need to update an existing schema or is

90
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,280
it probably not useful information like

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,480
kind of like if you ever see something

92
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,860
out of the corner of your eye and you

93
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,019
think did I see something is it a ghost

94
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,140
and your brain's like oh and you just

95
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,000
stop thinking about it that's when it's

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,099
just going to get rid of that data so

97
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,200
knowing that that's how our data our

98
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,860
brains make sense of the world around us

99
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,080
why do I remember the words to every

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
Britney Spears songs in existence but I

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
can't remember what I need to do on a

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,659
day-to-day basis without making a to-do

103
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,500
list

104
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,379
if our brains are so amazing and they

105
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,140
have all these different features why do

106
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,000
we always forget stuff that we find

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,299
useful well I read this article

108
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,340
it was on nature.com and it was called

109
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,439
The Forgotten part of memory and it was

110
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,360
written by Lauren gravitz

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,358
and it was about neuroscientists in

112
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,339
Canada and they did a research about the

113
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,260
process of forgetting and what they

114
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,919
found was it's most likely a feature and

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,020
not a bug and that our brains are

116
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,880
constantly going through this like data

117
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,860
management

118
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,320
process to help us learn and to help us

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,020
evolve and um

120
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,880
learn new things that is good for

121
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,940
survival again I don't know why out of

122
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,199
all the things I can remember it's

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,780
Britney Spears but it must be useful to

124
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,699
my survival

125
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,259
so let's talk about the different types

126
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,540
of business knowledge explicit knowledge

127
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,180
it's very easy to express I give the

128
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,880
example of a threat landscape report if

129
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
you work in CTI you've probably heard

130
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,360
this phrase before you could probably

131
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Define it easily you could probably say

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
what is in it but how your individual

133
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,259
business uh puts one together maybe like

134
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,080
the style of it the keywords if maybe

135
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,380
instead of executive summer you have

136
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,620
key points or key findings that's more

137
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,180
of the implicit knowledge that's

138
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,759
specific to your organization

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,720
the tacit knowledge which Dr Chris also

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,539
mentioned in his keynote if you go back

141
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,780
is really how we go to quote him from

142
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,180
perception to reality this is the

143
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,639
tradecraft of analysis and some people

144
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,180
think that this is challenging to

145
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,400
capture but I am here to say it is not

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,620
and you'll notice under tacit knowledge

147
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,180
that I have a little Mighty Warrior

148
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,520
symbol from my book this is going to be

149
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,440
found throughout my presentation and

150
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,419
it's going to be opportunities for

151
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,419
capturing that tacit knowledge

152
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,460
so let's talk about the state of current

153
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,840
Sops one of the issues that I understand

154
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,620
regardless of the size of your

155
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,940
organization

156
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,800
it takes time

157
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,560
and I don't have a solution for this is

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,440
going to take time to have Sops and it's

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,060
going to take a lot more time to have

160
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,220
good Sops

161
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,100
um and I'm going to talk about time in a

162
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,139
minute and you will see another shout

163
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,000
out that makes you think that you might

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
actually have more time than you think

165
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,500
another thing that I see with Sops is a

166
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,020
lot of times it will talk about tasks

167
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,479
that you have routine tasks but it won't

168
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,419
necessarily say why do we have those

169
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,139
routine tasks it won't say what business

170
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,840
function is this task helping and I feel

171
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,400
like there's an education opportunity

172
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,280
for analysts because if you don't know

173
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,900
why you're doing it

174
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,940
it can be challenging when you take that

175
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,259
implicit knowledge to another

176
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,020
organization and they ask you you know

177
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,639
in the interview or whatever

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,380
why did you do that like why do you

179
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,720
think that that type of uh report or

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,460
task is important and you have no idea

181
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,080
because you just haven't got that

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,539
education so I think the why you're

183
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,220
doing something whether it's why it's

184
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,840
important to the clients or why it's

185
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,580
important to the business is important

186
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,919
to add into the Sops

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,020
so if you haven't seen this talk by

188
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,960
Sherman if you're in CTI or you manage a

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
CTI team it's one of the greatest talks

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,160
I've ever seen I saw it and instantly

191
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
was like yes

192
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,780
this so if you think you do not have

193
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,979
time

194
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,900
you might find that you actually have

195
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,419
more time than you think so I recommend

196
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,039
going back and watching that either on

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,419
the Stan's website or on YouTube

198
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,020
so

199
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,380
another thing that I've noticed is Sops

200
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,440
are not I don't know why it has a Dell

201
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,139
I felt really silly when John had a

202
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,699
Taylor Swift and I was like is that a

203
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,800
Taylor Swift why did the why did I find

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,020
a meme that has Adele whatever we're

205
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,440
gonna go with it but a lot of times saps

206
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,259
are not up to date and or a lot of times

207
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,380
what I see is you have this expensive

208
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,539
product that your manager thought would

209
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,580
be a good idea to use and so you have

210
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,880
Sops for that specific tool but then

211
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,220
they decide the license for that for the

212
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,720
whole team is too expensive so you've

213
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,919
switched to a cheaper tool or open

214
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,900
source tool but you haven't updated your

215
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,720
Sops so then when someone comes in to do

216
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,360
that job they're like oh yeah

217
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,979
that we don't do that anymore and then

218
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,599
that person has to kind of like Shadow

219
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,639
someone and Flounder and I feel like

220
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,620
they shouldn't have to do that it's

221
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,760
stressful

222
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,219
the other thing I've noticed is a lot of

223
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,380
times if you work in an environment that

224
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,419
Fosters creative freedom

225
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,219
where people could come up with new

226
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,899
ideas

227
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,520
um and say you know I think it would be

228
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,279
a really good idea to do an end of year

229
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,240
report or I think we should do uh you

230
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
know whatever it is that you think is a

231
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,660
great idea for your organization maybe

232
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,760
it's just a way to automate a process

233
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,100
and you create something

234
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,200
and it becomes part of the team like

235
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,620
part of a critical routine task but it's

236
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,240
not necessarily

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
uh documented it may not be documented

238
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
in a way that anyone but that one person

239
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,320
understands

240
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,839
so let's talk about impact

241
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,920
so when you do not have good Sops it

242
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,720
sucks when someone leaves

243
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,220
especially if they've been there for a

244
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,779
long time because they have all that

245
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,519
tacit knowledge

246
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,620
and if they haven't captured it you're

247
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,540
going to basically try to find someone

248
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,240
to replace that person and I'm here to

249
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,600
say might be an unpopular opinion but I

250
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,640
don't think anyone is replaceable I

251
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,959
think everyone that is in the audience

252
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,820
whether you're virtual or here

253
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,680
physically you are not replaceable

254
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,000
because you all have your own

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,420
experiences your own tacit knowledge

256
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,519
your own perspectives and so a lot of

257
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,680
times when organizations go to hire

258
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,800
someone the long process because whether

259
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,300
they know they have a bias in their

260
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,000
brain or not they do sometimes and

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,380
instead of looking for someone that's

262
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,200
qualified for that role or is eager to

263
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,940
learn and has a good attitude and could

264
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,100
quickly grow into that role they just

265
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,140
want to find a replacement I want the

266
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,360
Unicorn that has these Niche skills that

267
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,860
the person who left and you're not

268
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,600
always going to find that

269
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,640
and then if you do find someone and they

270
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,200
go to the onboarding

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
and you don't have Sops in a central

272
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,779
location it could feel like a goose

273
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,959
chase not only for the person

274
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,220
onboarding that employee but also for

275
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,620
the person that is the employee and like

276
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,440
I know for me specifically I write a lot

277
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,839
of sticky notes and I stick them all

278
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,240
over my monitors and I kind of Judge My

279
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,019
Success at a new uh business like uh how

280
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,899
many I could take away over time and I

281
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,180
feel like if I'm already doing this why

282
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,880
aren't we you know capturing that in sop

283
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
so people don't have to flounder in

284
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,380
right like you know dozens of notes the

285
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,240
other point I wanted to make is that

286
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,640
single point of failure if you have

287
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,880
someone that leaves and they have all

288
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,980
this knowledge or or they had created

289
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,560
all these new ideas or reports

290
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,600
it sucks for your team trying to

291
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,579
replicate it especially if it has to do

292
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,500
with like coding and things like that

293
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,120
and maybe not everyone on the team has

294
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,860
that

295
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,040
so I want to talk quickly about how I

296
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,320
stumbled upon thick steps

297
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,800
in 2020 I was writing a blog or I was

298
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,740
doing research to write a blog about the

299
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,360
analytic tradecraft

300
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,480
and I wanted to expand upon the word of

301
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,519
analysis because I felt like we don't do

302
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,140
that enough as an industry and a couple

303
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,760
people have said this throughout the

304
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,620
summit that we kind of have an

305
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,959
assumption that everyone understands

306
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,279
what we're talking about when we say

307
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,660
certain words

308
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,300
and I went through different Industries

309
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,100
to see how do other Industries perform

310
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,560
analysis and I took my favorite things

311
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
from each one and created my framework

312
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,620
and one of them was think steps

313
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,600
and

314
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,300
this one was from a white paper and it

315
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,899
was called how analysts think think

316
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,720
steps as a tool for structured sense

317
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,160
making and criminal intelligence

318
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,420
analysis try saying that five times fast

319
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,300
it is not easy but basically the authors

320
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,920
of this white paper interviewed criminal

321
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,839
investigators and they all had cases

322
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,779
that had pre-prepared to discuss and and

323
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,540
they talked about their analytic process

324
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,160
throughout their investigation

325
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,640
and the mind map that you see is kind of

326
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,040
what the authors put together

327
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,260
this is a lesson in QA because it

328
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,120
literally says model of police

329
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,300
operational intelligence analysis I put

330
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,519
model of police crime analysis process

331
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,459
don't know why we will talk about QA in

332
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,079
a minute but

333
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,680
think steps basically are a template

334
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,160
that allow the investigator to approach

335
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,139
the case decompose it into separate

336
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,880
elements and then classify the data

337
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,019
during the investigation accordingly

338
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,920
for example one particular

339
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,899
investigator that was interviewed

340
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,779
they had never

341
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,920
investigated the type of crime that they

342
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,019
had brought they had prepared for this

343
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,279
interview and it was on human

344
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,600
trafficking

345
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,940
and this is where I learned that they

346
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,180
not only use think steps as a way to

347
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,500
help themselves during their own

348
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,540
investigation to keep on track and

349
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,519
Associate data accordingly they also use

350
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,740
it as a training tool

351
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,720
um for people who have never you know if

352
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,100
they've never done it they already have

353
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,200
a template to kind of go learn and they

354
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,180
do something called a phenomenon study

355
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,120
and this is where they

356
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,339
they already have the template for this

357
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,500
crime they go and research all of the

358
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,019
little bits of that crime so that they

359
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,880
know what they're looking for during the

360
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,079
investigation

361
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,120
and this is a similar mind map that what

362
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,959
you'll find in the white paper I

363
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,060
recreated it in Whimsical which is free

364
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,519
and I love it on the right hand side you

365
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,560
will see the information about the

366
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
person or persons involved in the crime

367
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,519
and this is just useful information for

368
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,620
them to have readily available during

369
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,480
their investigation

370
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,720
I have a small confession to make

371
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,019
I have ADHD and I don't know about some

372
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,820
other people with ADHD but sometimes

373
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,920
when I'm reading something particularly

374
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,899
if it's about anything related to sense

375
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,079
making or cognitive science Dr Chris's

376
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,700
dissertation

377
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,779
um

378
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,540
I get so excited and sometimes my brain

379
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,220
skips ahead to what I think is most

380
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,800
interesting and I may or may not fully

381
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,560
understand the holistic view of what I'm

382
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,180
reading and when I first read about

383
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,420
think steps I took out key pieces

384
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,360
but when Rick reviewed my slides he had

385
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,160
pointed it out so thank you Rick because

386
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
I realize I missed something very

387
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,440
important not only in my framework but

388
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,699
in the blogs that I've written about

389
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,339
think steps and you noticed on the last

390
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,260
Slide the think steps were just words

391
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,899
they're just you know very short things

392
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,519
that you need to think about

393
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,620
during the phenomenon study the criminal

394
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,560
investigators added the context and what

395
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,540
I thought was think Stacks or think

396
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,800
steps was the context because I knew in

397
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,560
my life that's what was missing and so

398
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,899
today I am

399
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,779
um presenting the think steps plus the

400
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,820
context to not only improve your own

401
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,100
personal investigations but also your

402
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,279
Sops to help with training

403
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,519
so my first example is a threat actor

404
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,760
profile this is a very repeatable

405
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,220
um report or even if you're just doing

406
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,899
it for an internal knowledge base at one

407
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,760
point or another if you work in CTI

408
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,260
you've probably done a threat actor

409
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,220
profile

410
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,199
and on the left hand side

411
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,000
these are my think steps and you might

412
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,699
think well this looks a lot like almost

413
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,699
like an outline of things to include in

414
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,160
your paper but if that's your

415
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,620
deliverable or it could be a PowerPoint

416
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,760
however you're delivering the

417
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,279
intelligence but it's not exactly that

418
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,160
similar but not exactly it is basically

419
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,360
the things that I want to think about

420
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,519
during the investigation but not all of

421
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,620
them may end up in deliverable so like

422
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,139
previous known attacks that you know if

423
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,220
they don't have any previous known

424
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,420
attacks you're not going to add that but

425
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,800
it is something that is critical that

426
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,480
you should look at

427
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,100
um and the tricky Dragons It's not a

428
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,839
real threat actor but it is from my book

429
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,240
you might look cute he's very tricky

430
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,740
don't trust him

431
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,980
so on the right side

432
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,019
um the first two points are the

433
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,940
intelligence requirements and this is

434
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,339
specifically if you're doing you know

435
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,019
I've always been at the vendor so I

436
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,660
always do a lot of rfis but even if

437
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,040
you're doing something internal for your

438
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,019
own knowledge base I feel like having

439
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,740
some type of ir is still really good and

440
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,720
for an sop

441
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,120
I mean our all rfis are going to be

442
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,220
different sfps are going to be a little

443
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,480
bit different for the most part there's

444
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,360
a lot of IRS that are very much the same

445
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,699
and so I feel like having example IRS

446
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,319
it's another training tool that you can

447
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,400
have

448
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,260
um and specifically if you have it set

449
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,599
up so that it's similar to like what the

450
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,579
client is going to request to help your

451
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,260
analysts to be able to read through the

452
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,099
lines

453
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,520
on the bottom on the right hand side I

454
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,619
put example information that you might

455
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,959
get from a client or just from your own

456
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,760
knowledge of that particular thread

457
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,059
actor and that's just useful information

458
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,500
you can even put another one like

459
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,000
tactical audience a strategic audience

460
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,039
so adding the contacts this is one of

461
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,020
the thing steps think if I just clicked

462
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,660
on it expand it Minority Report Style

463
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,980
I feel like

464
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,440
you know previous mentions of an example

465
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,500
organization it's important and a lot of

466
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,780
us know it's important but if you have

467
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,039
someone that's newer that's getting into

468
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,660
the field they may not know why that's

469
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,220
important so I think it's important to

470
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Define not only why it's important the

471
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,260
potential impact but also the different

472
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,360
types of mentions because not every

473
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,620
threat actor is going to go out and be

474
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,960
like Oh I'm tacking example you know

475
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,660
they might say I'm attacking a financial

476
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,520
services institution in the United

477
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,400
States with the revenue of 50 billion or

478
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,080
you know whatever it is

479
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,400
so

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,679
that's tacit knowledge that I have from

481
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,780
experience but may not be you know

482
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,160
something that everybody knows and I

483
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,419
feel like we can capture that

484
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
so

485
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,160
uh another shout out to Gert for Bob

486
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,200
Ross talk that he did the joy of threat

487
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,820
Landscaping

488
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,740
um because my second example was cyber

489
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,620
uh threat landscape I wanted to give his

490
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,120
quote which is the intelligence

491
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,860
requirements are the sketches of my

492
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,860
research I absolutely love that so on

493
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,120
the left side again I have the think

494
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,740
steps these are the things that I would

495
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,440
add to a report if I was doing a threat

496
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,640
landscape report and this one is

497
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
industry specific so it's very general

498
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,620
it's very broad just as an example and

499
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,240
again another example intelligence

500
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,700
requirement on the right

501
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,280
and then if I were to break out one of

502
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,500
those intelligence require or uh think

503
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,039
steps expand upon it add the context

504
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,799
Define what it is Define the impact of

505
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,720
that thing Define

506
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,580
um the different uh things to look for

507
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,160
why is it important and this is an

508
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,299
opportunity not only for you to add

509
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,440
education but this is the information

510
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,880
you might actually end up putting in

511
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,080
your report especially if it's an

512
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,640
executive audience so you're just saving

513
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,440
yourself time by having it already

514
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,660
prepared in your Sops

515
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,299
and then even going into like how are

516
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,340
you doing it you know I like to use

517
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,620
Google door King because it helps with

518
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,480
like at least for secondary reporting

519
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,179
because it gets to the point it saves me

520
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,160
time so I feel like going into specific

521
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,919
details where are you looking for uh

522
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,720
this information what are things to look

523
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,740
for

524
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,600
um why is it important

525
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,419
so this is a quick I am running low on

526
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,360
time so I wanted to give another example

527
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
I don't have context for this one but I

528
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,280
wanted to show another example of how it

529
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,200
could be used for Sops it's more like

530
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,760
how the criminal investigators were

531
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
using it which is information or

532
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,940
characteristics about a specific crime

533
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,880
or things that you may see

534
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,100
um if you are you know in your

535
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,559
environment so on the right hand side I

536
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,440
added some invest some intelligence

537
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,539
requirements but I also think this is a

538
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,860
great opportunity if you're going to

539
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,140
model it like this to put stuff that

540
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,080
like common words or language that

541
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,520
um at least if you're on a vendor that

542
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,059
clients use because sometimes uh you'll

543
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,200
notice when you're trying to create

544
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
intelligence requirements you have to

545
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,679
read between the lines you can kind of

546
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,480
see what they want but you have to be

547
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,400
able to kind of put it into clearer

548
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,160
words so that you can actually provide a

549
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,440
deliverable so that's another way that

550
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
you use it

551
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,080
so how do we operationalize this

552
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,120
the first thing I would say having a

553
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,179
central location is extremely important

554
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,880
and of course I'm going to recommend

555
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,640
Excel because like Katie Nichols says it

556
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,679
is undoubtedly the best CTI tool of all

557
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,400
time

558
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,900
one of the other things that I love

559
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,419
about it is that you can

560
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,640
you can add in kind of like mind maps

561
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440
but then you can link it to other slides

562
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,600
so if you did want to expand upon it

563
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,580
even if it's linking to another tool

564
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,559
that's fine but it's centrally located

565
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,500
so it's not a big boost Chase for your

566
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,860
analysts so first thing I say is make a

567
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,220
list of the routine tasks that your team

568
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,419
does

569
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,299
and then after you've finished that put

570
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,760
that aside and then make a list of the

571
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,799
strengths of all of your team members

572
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
and the reason I say that is because

573
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
sometimes when we're just thinking about

574
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,620
routine tasks we're just thinking about

575
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,419
the tasks that are in our job

576
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,500
description

577
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,179
but when you start thinking about the

578
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,159
strengths of people you start thinking

579
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,159
about all those little single points of

580
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,200
failure tasks that they do for us that's

581
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,120
not really part of their job description

582
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,400
so you might find some more goodies in

583
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,159
there that you can collect Sops for and

584
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,740
then use your own internal resources you

585
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,419
know if you already have Sops just build

586
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,159
upon them there's no use like

587
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,260
Reinventing the wheel

588
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,880
um and if you don't you know you could

589
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
start small with just a couple processes

590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
and

591
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,440
um the way that you capture the tacit

592
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,480
knowledge really the meat and potatoes

593
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,320
of the presentation is I feel like we

594
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,500
always say everybody learns differently

595
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,360
but we don't really talk about everybody

596
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,460
teaches differently

597
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,559
and I don't know about you but when I

598
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,539
get assigned Sops

599
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,240
I don't really like

600
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,799
um because it's like it's hard to go

601
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,480
through the process and you want it to

602
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,520
look nice and it takes time as I said

603
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,880
but something that Rick's team actually

604
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,380
did really well when I was at digital

605
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,760
Shadows

606
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,280
um hat tip to Ivan riggy he used to

607
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,780
videotape stuff

608
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,900
that he did and it was amazing for me on

609
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,640
a remote team because I can go back and

610
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,559
watch it and when you're doing it on

611
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,460
video

612
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,580
you might you know spit out that tacit

613
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,020
knowledge that you may not put into

614
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,520
written work

615
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,240
and it was extremely useful and

616
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,280
I feel like sometimes you're you're

617
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
limited because some of the

618
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,159
investigations you're going to do going

619
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,140
to have client data so you can't

620
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,720
necessarily keep that in your Sops so

621
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,840
you can sanitize it or also if you have

622
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,700
any type of repeatable tasks that's not

623
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,260
necessarily related to a specific

624
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,960
company or if you can recreate it in a

625
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,700
similar fashion

626
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,620
um with just information that's out

627
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,700
there

628
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,280
um like a known malicious things that

629
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,380
you can put in its place

630
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,120
um one of the things I like to do that I

631
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,400
have actually done before is after I

632
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
have finished I had like one week where

633
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,000
I had finished a tactical report in a

634
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,039
strategic report just so happens in the

635
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,020
same week and there was someone on my

636
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,760
team that was looking to know more about

637
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,460
my thought processes so I got on a call

638
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,140
with them and just kind of went over

639
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,320
like you know if I'm on virus told I'm

640
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,059
looking at the you know malware that's

641
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,500
communicating with it and then I'm

642
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,120
looking at the related you know

643
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,280
infrastructure and then I might go on

644
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,039
uh if I'm doing like a strategic report

645
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,000
I like to use uh unit 42's Playbook they

646
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
have a lot of Industry specific stuff

647
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,380
secureworks has some stuff leaping

648
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,960
computer is a great knowledge base if

649
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,580
you just go in and you type in like

650
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,559
whatever your industry is financial

651
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,539
services or whatever then you could see

652
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,760
every time they've tagged that in a

653
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,679
story and that's extremely useful

654
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,620
information and this is just stuff that

655
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,840
you know we might think is obvious but

656
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,640
it's not going to be obvious to other

657
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,179
team members so I think pay attention or

658
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,220
ask your team members how do they like

659
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,020
to learn that would like to follow along

660
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,419
do they like to not talk to anyone and

661
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,919
just read it do they like screenshots

662
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,260
but also ask them how do they like to

663
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,100
teach

664
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,740
because if they are just going to get on

665
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,539
a zoom call even if you're able to just

666
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,159
record it or if they're just going to

667
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,020
explain it maybe even just in a lunch

668
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,480
and Learn Type situation where they're

669
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,799
just explaining their thought process

670
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
that might be more comfortable for them

671
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,580
and everyone will still get the

672
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,039
knowledge and you could even record you

673
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,860
know that for people that missed it

674
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,860
and then peer review as we saw very

675
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,360
important

676
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,700
um and I think it's really important to

677
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,620
not just look for grammar mistakes but

678
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,140
look for like actually try to do that

679
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,760
thing and

680
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,400
have your managers do it have your

681
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,039
seniors do it have your newbies do it

682
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,080
and try to go through the process

683
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,779
because if you can't follow the steps or

684
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,820
you have one part that doesn't work you

685
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,240
have to document that and onboarding is

686
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,400
a great time to review your Sops but

687
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,320
I will say every organization that I've

688
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,960
been at is really good at asking me you

689
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,360
know what are my opinions are about the

690
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,980
onboarding process what are my opinions

691
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,260
about their Sops and their processes

692
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,659
they're always looking for feedback

693
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,460
um I don't know about you but I'm never

694
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,880
gonna be like oh it's garbage

695
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,679
it's it's total garbage thank you for

696
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,080
hiring me but let me make fun of you so

697
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,299
don't expect your newbies to actually

698
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,039
answer that question

699
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,980
ask but they might not answer what you

700
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,340
should be doing is asking them how is it

701
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,059
going

702
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,340
and if you notice that they are reading

703
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,140
an s p and it doesn't make sense to them

704
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,200
or some part of it's disconnecting

705
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,760
especially if it's something Technical

706
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,860
and they're getting some type of error

707
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,120
that's a cue for you to update it or to

708
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,860
get someone else to update it put it on

709
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,020
your to-do list it's not a job for your

710
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,720
newbie to figure it out it's just your

711
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,539
cue as a senior or manager to get that

712
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,360
fixed so it's easier for the next person

713
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,179
and lastly make sure it's a living

714
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,340
document it's hard

715
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,900
chasing

716
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,760
um

717
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,500
Sops down and getting them done it is

718
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,380
hard it takes time but it's worth it I

719
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,740
have seen pure chaos and and not a lot

720
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,659
of processes in place that I've seen

721
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,460
where there's a lot of processes in a

722
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,520
lot of Sops and it makes your life a

723
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,260
hundred times better as an analyst on

724
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,940
your day-to-day even if you have to do

725
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,700
extra work because it's organized so I

726
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
do think there is light at the end of

727
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,679
the tunnel and you will see

728
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,900
um rewards for that and then anytime

729
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,240
again if you're switching tools and your

730
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,880
Sops for that specific tools try and

731
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,940
update that or any changes to existing

732
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,279
tasks any new ideas that get created

733
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,120
into a task the great way to do it so

734
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,140
remember

735
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,559
uh our brains are amazing at how we make

736
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,419
sense of the world around us but you're

737
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,220
not going to remember everything so if

738
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,980
you know you're wired to forget then why

739
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,320
not capture that data while you still

740
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,400
have it it takes time but it is worth it

741
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,860
and try to keep them up to date try to

742
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,900
not only talk about what it is you're

743
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,779
doing how you're doing it why you're

744
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,299
doing it and avoid single points of

745
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,400
failure

746
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,559
and while you're avoiding single points

747
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,200
of failure make sure you're not impeding

748
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,240
on creative freedom unless you want to

749
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,960
and that's that's on you but

750
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,400
also

751
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,580
adding the think steps as a template

752
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,200
specifically for those repeatable tasks

753
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,659
that you have not only like internal

754
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,640
tasks but you know whether it's rfis

755
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,340
reports and then you know that

756
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,679
information can be used not only to help

757
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,980
your analysts stay on task during the

758
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,900
their investigations but also for

759
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,539
training other employees

760
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,919
and I finished on time

761
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,220
thank you

762
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,418
