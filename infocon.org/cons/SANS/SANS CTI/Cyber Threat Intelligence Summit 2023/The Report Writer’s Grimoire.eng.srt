1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,240
folks to this session on the report

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,139
writers wearing wire or grimoire uh my

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,360
name is John Grimm as Lillian indicated

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,100
I am a director for cyber threat

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,080
intelligence for Experian I've been with

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,900
the team for just over a year and prior

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,320
to joining Experian I was with the

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
investigative response world doing

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,980
corporate uh investigations on behalf of

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,380
our clients and prior to joining that I

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,899
was a U.S army special agent in cyber

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,480
counterintelligence investigations both

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,420
as a civilian and as a soldier and I

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,620
also was involved with human

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,320
intelligence in terms of uh being the US

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,440
Army interrogator so report writing is

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,260
near and dear to me it's something that

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,140
I've really learned to embrace over my

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,539
career back in the old days when I was

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,660
doing non-cyber intelligence as well as

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,239
the current uh cyber uh threat

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,280
intelligence role that I have

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,760
so why is report writing so important

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,280
well first and foremost with the

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,720
training that I've had I've always been

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,100
a little bit disappointed when I go

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,420
through forensics training or

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,939
intelligence training and I don't see

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,280
very much in terms of writing actual

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,080
reports with the exception of

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,820
counterintologists it was a very good

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,759
course there learning how to convey your

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
findings so over the years I've learned

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,000
to build out my own grimoire or codex in

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
terms of writing reports because after

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,080
all that's why we're here we're here to

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,000
convey our findings if you're looking at

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,340
the Cyber threat intelligence cycle or

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,380
even the investigative response cycle

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,619
all of that can mean nothing unless

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,479
you've actually conveyed your findings

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,860
to your audience okay so real quick

44
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,899
um what I wanted to kind of focus on is

45
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,579
some of the building blocks to getting

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,100
to that report writing phase and if we

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,119
look here

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,579
at the intelligence life cycle and this

49
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,079
is the intelligence life cycle slightly

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,720
modified from The Joint she's a staff

51
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,820
there are six phases here we're going to

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,220
focus on certain aspects of certain

53
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,139
phases okay we're going to look at the

54
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,599
direction aspect of the first phase of

55
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,580
planning and direction we're going to

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,200
skip ahead to the fourth phase of

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
analysis to production and focus on the

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,260
production piece this is where we're

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,720
going to be writing our reports and the

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,040
fifth piece right here we're going to

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,599
look at in terms of phases is

62
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,220
dissemination and integration are more

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,200
specifically dissemination and it's

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,459
really important

65
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,980
um to to think about how your report is

66
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,280
disseminated and integrated into your

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,580
audience's activities it could be your

68
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,980
audience might be doing patching for

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,900
example for vulnerabilities or they may

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,879
be a red team that's using your report

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,640
okay so dissemination is really

72
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
important and then of course the

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,700
evaluation and feedback and depending on

74
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,620
how you look at the cycle it could be at

75
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,060
the very end or it could be all

76
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,400
throughout the intelligence cycle so

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
let's get into to the grimoire and all

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
the components for the grimoire so first

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,000
and foremost when we're looking at the

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
intelligence cycle and we're looking at

81
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,780
that first piece the direction piece we

82
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,700
want to focus on the task at hand

83
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,739
understand what we're looking to do in

84
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,319
terms of conveying our findings to our

85
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,540
audience so the process we just talked

86
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,400
about that and where report writing fits

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,620
in within the intelligence cycle and you

88
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,300
can also think of report writing within

89
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,860
the investigative response or incident

90
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,780
response cycle as well

91
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,420
the requirements the inputs outputs

92
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,920
sources and consumers are going to talk

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,720
about each one of these as we build up

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,000
to actually writing a report and then

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,620
let's get into the production piece the

96
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,780
telling an informed story what are the

97
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,000
vehicles for relaying your findings

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,280
what's the structure the vocabulary you

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
want to use and the storytelling and

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,120
then finally we'll move into the

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,099
dissemination piece which is delivering

102
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,959
the solid product we've built the

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,180
product you're about to disseminate it

104
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,340
you need to add a few more things here

105
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,799
the veracity of your Source the veracity

106
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,080
of your information and how confident

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,260
you are in the levels of uh of findings

108
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,540
that you have any gaps recommendations

109
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,599
any markings for your reports sharing

110
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,519
your report in the review process and

111
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,860
then lastly the evaluation piece

112
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,920
obtaining actionable feedback on your

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,620
actual findings the report that you've

114
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,620
delivered to your audience

115
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,060
so first let's look at Direction

116
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,520
focusing on the task at hand this could

117
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,280
be also titled the building blocks of

118
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,160
getting to delay or relaying your your

119
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
report so what are the requirements and

120
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,360
don't want to spend too much time on

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,460
pirs priority intelligence requirements

122
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,860
or information requirements or any other

123
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,479
types of requirements you have they're

124
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,180
driving your intelligence but you want

125
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,160
to have a good understanding of your

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,259
pirs and here's four examples here

127
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,180
derived from the various framework which

128
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,580
underlies things such as the data breach

129
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,500
investigations report that Verizon does

130
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,880
so I just pulled these real quick as

131
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,300
examples four pirs um who's your

132
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,580
adversary how will the adversary Target

133
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,720
us

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,479
who will the adversary Target in terms

135
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,820
of assets of people and how will the

136
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,440
adversary impact us it's really

137
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,479
important to know these pirs I don't

138
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,639
recommend a lot of pirs I recommend

139
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,740
somewhere between 8 and 12. you can

140
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,780
certainly have sub pirs if you want to

141
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,180
so understand your requirements what is

142
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
driving your intelligence what is

143
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,520
driving the need for reporting

144
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,380
another uh framework that I'm very uh

145
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,720
fond of is the cypok framework which is

146
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,979
something that folks may be familiar

147
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,100
with it's a lean Six Sigma related first

148
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,600
I believe developed by the automated

149
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,360
industry in terms of automobile industry

150
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,560
in terms of uh Supply uh inputs process

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
outputs and customers so we have

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,060
modified this slightly here sources and

153
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,419
inputs which would be your inputs into

154
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,160
your information collection so who or

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,500
what are your sources of information how

156
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,940
is that information collected and then

157
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,740
as we get into the process piece the P

158
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,320
this is where your information

159
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,580
transforms into intelligence and then

160
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,740
the back of the process the O and C the

161
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,479
outputs in the consumer how is that

162
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,759
intelligence conveyed and who or what

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,380
are the consumers of intelligence and

164
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,419
this is what we're here today about is

165
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,880
relaying that product that you've put

166
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,320
together based on your intelligence

167
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,960
analysis and packaging it up in a way

168
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,139
that's helpful to your actual consumer

169
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,319
so with the pirs one of the things you

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,759
also want to do and just touching on

171
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,259
this real quick is have a collection

172
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,720
plan identify your sources of

173
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,100
information maybe they're external

174
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,840
sources it could be organizations it

175
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,060
could be tools internal sources as well

176
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,580
and what kind of coverage you have this

177
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,080
is important because you're answering

178
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,660
these pirs but you also have to include

179
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,819
any gaps and we'll get to that shortly

180
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,620
within your intelligence collection and

181
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,840
Analysis that may impact your actual

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,060
findings

183
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,940
so the consumers uh telling the story

184
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,800
one of the biggest components of a story

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,500
is who's actually reading or consuming

186
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,860
your your intelligence and we've had uh

187
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,180
various different

188
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,919
um discussions I know in the past in

189
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,419
terms of what strategic operational

190
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,419
tactical intelligence means uh to me

191
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,639
because of my bias from coming from the

192
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,340
military and the non-cyber field prior

193
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,100
to my cyber time I think of strategic

194
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,539
operational tactic a little bit

195
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,400
differently I think strategic is more

196
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,080
like theater and Regional intelligence

197
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,080
operational is more within that actual

198
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,699
theater and tactical as the folks that

199
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,620
are on the ground I think of tactical

200
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,539
short-term operational a little bit

201
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,580
longer and strategic as long-term

202
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,440
planning I also think of different

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,720
echelons in terms of military and how

204
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,819
it's organized but generally speaking

205
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,340
this can transpose into the cyber world

206
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,280
and you can see here with strategic this

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,380
is looking to answer The Who and the why

208
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,960
okay and this is for executive level in

209
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,720
terms of your audience more longer term

210
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
planning and maybe not so technical in

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,520
terms of its details when we're looking

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,860
at operational reporting this is the how

213
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,860
the medium-term planning your leadership

214
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,199
your mid-level managers your leading

215
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,199
technical teams for example there are

216
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,520
technical details within that

217
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,940
operational reporting but not really a

218
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,340
ton of things such as iocs maybe those

219
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,039
are reported separately for the uh the

220
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,360
more tactical folks and then the

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,819
Tactical level the who or the how the

222
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,460
what the when and the where this is the

223
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,080
Here and Now activities things that are

224
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,520
happening immediately this is for the

225
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,740
technicians and has a lot of technical

226
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,060
details and then you can talk about

227
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,160
technical intelligence and one of my

228
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,840
favorite topics is topical intelligence

229
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,159
the things that are happening out there

230
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,779
in the media that get a lot of attention

231
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,958
it may not really translate into

232
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
strategic operation or tactical but are

233
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,399
more informative in nature so choose

234
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,260
your appropriate story know who your

235
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,560
audience is the executives tend to look

236
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,459
more for documents to read whereas uh

237
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,160
depending on on the audience you may

238
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,779
choose to put it in some more of a

239
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,700
presentation or webinar

240
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,140
and we'll talk about that as well

241
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,399
shortly

242
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,980
so number two production telling an

243
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,560
informed story okay so what do we mean

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
by that well let's start off with how do

245
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,959
we package this up okay how do we convey

246
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,060
our findings and two of the ways very

247
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,399
basically is either in a PowerPoint

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
presentation or a similar presentation

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,860
or a Microsoft Word documents both you

250
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,440
can convert to a PDF file before you

251
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,080
disseminate to your audience the pros

252
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,360
for PowerPoint is it's a flexible format

253
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,660
it's graphic friendly and it's good for

254
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,980
presentations it's built for

255
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,860
presentations the cons is it's not so

256
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,839
good for detailed findings okay and this

257
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,940
is where we get into Microsoft Word for

258
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,220
example it's got a structured format

259
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,380
it's a little bit less flexible in terms

260
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,540
of the PowerPoint it's not as graphic

261
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,160
friendly and it's good for detailed

262
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,880
findings multiple pages of text if

263
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,279
you're going to be describing uh some

264
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,500
kind of concept or finding within your

265
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,779
report it's not so good for presentation

266
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,540
so these are the two vehicles that I

267
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,580
pretty much have used uh in my career in

268
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,899
terms of conveying findings

269
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,540
so format or structure I should say in

270
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,360
two of the formats that I've used over

271
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,180
time that help me convey findings and

272
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,920
put things into a structured manner

273
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,860
having structure to your report is

274
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,920
easier for the audience to read but it's

275
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,140
also easier to do analysis on your

276
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,120
previous reporting when you have the

277
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
same types of sections within your

278
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,399
report so on the left hand side is the

279
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
bsar and this is a format that's more

280
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,920
it's better in my in my findings for

281
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,720
tactical or operational level reporting

282
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,000
okay so with everything you want to have

283
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,380
your bluff your bottom line up front

284
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,320
okay and it's simple statement at the

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,540
very top of your report that that

286
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,720
conveys and maybe a sentence or two what

287
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,920
is the bottom line what are we looking

288
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,880
at

289
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,620
and then you get into things such as the

290
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,660
situation what's the background

291
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,880
the assessment what is your intelligence

292
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,579
assessment what response activities did

293
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,579
your team or did the organization do in

294
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,579
terms of the findings within the report

295
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,560
or the findings before the actual report

296
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,140
was was uh was put together this might

297
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,899
be a report in support of investigative

298
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,360
response or instant response activities

299
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,160
what are the recommendations in terms of

300
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,540
going forward and we'll talk more about

301
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,640
recommendations here shortly and then

302
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,320
what are your references what are your

303
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,420
references your sources as well as any

304
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,339
additional resources that can Enlighten

305
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,160
the audience that you didn't put in your

306
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,500
your report but you're citing that as a

307
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,720
secondary reference for them to go to to

308
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,240
learn more on the topic so

309
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,860
on the left hand side this is good for

310
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,600
tactical and operational level reporting

311
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,760
and then in my experience uh if you're

312
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,260
looking for strategic and operational

313
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,200
level reporting the visar format is or B

314
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
Store formula it's a little bit more

315
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,779
appropriate you've got your bottom line

316
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,860
up front

317
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,720
very similar you've got your situation

318
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,420
any observations that you've made your

319
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,100
assessment and then any recommendations

320
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,560
so we're missing the response piece and

321
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,700
as you can see

322
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,260
um that's the difference between the

323
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,019
b-ser and the B solar format okay why

324
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,519
are we missing that well this is more of

325
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,899
a strategic or operational level

326
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,940
planning type of report that you're

327
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,700
providing uh perhaps in support of

328
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,600
executive level decision making

329
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,079
so vocabulary one thing is is very very

330
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,320
important is that you parallel any kind

331
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,300
of vocabulary or Frameworks that your

332
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,860
organization uses and I'll talk a little

333
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,660
bit more about framework shortly as well

334
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,760
this is just an example of the minor

335
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,740
attack framework you can use the

336
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,620
Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain some

337
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,300
sort of framework to help convey your

338
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,880
findings you can see here there's 14

339
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,279
different tactics and there's 191

340
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,019
different techniques that sit underneath

341
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,320
all 14 of these different tactics what a

342
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,720
great way to convey your findings

343
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,399
by using about vocabulary that's

344
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,200
accepted by the industry as well as your

345
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,720
organization a picture says a thousand

346
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,720
words you can include tables that are

347
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,519
based on lighter attack within your

348
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,680
reports those tables can show tactics

349
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,959
and techniques Matt to the mitigations

350
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,320
or maybe even the software saves you a

351
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,480
lot of writing and saves your reader or

352
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,220
your consumer from a lot of reading

353
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,279
so in terms of Storytelling and

354
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,899
originally when I was putting this

355
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,000
presentation together prior to putting

356
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
together my whole Focus was on the

357
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,440
storing the storytelling aspects of it

358
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,480
and perhaps this is a follow-on session

359
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,300
in the future because there's so much uh

360
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,940
in terms of this this topic both from

361
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,160
the standpoint of content and from the

362
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,620
standpoint of Standards so here's some

363
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,480
examples here in terms of Storytelling

364
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,639
so you want to make sure again you

365
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,200
understand your audience and you're

366
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,940
conveying your findings in a way that's

367
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,220
understandable to them some of the ways

368
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,779
you can do that in terms of content is

369
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,519
visuals your graphs your tables your

370
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,620
diagram a picture says a thousand words

371
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,100
right especially if it's a framework

372
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,959
that they're familiar with

373
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,019
Clarity active voice subject verb object

374
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,940
for English speakers versus passive

375
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,740
voice it really does cut down on

376
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,860
ambiguity ambiguity and confusion

377
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,079
so always look to use the active voice

378
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,940
the extent you can

379
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,880
subject did this rather than this was

380
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,459
done by the subject avoid slang this is

381
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,980
more professional and reduces any kind

382
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,320
of confusion as well short title and

383
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,240
spell out your acronyms never assume

384
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,860
that your audience knows what those

385
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,600
acronyms stand for

386
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,639
spell those out

387
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,920
the common terminology

388
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,320
perhaps your organization has a security

389
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,480
operations glossary or something similar

390
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,880
that's a great tool a great reference to

391
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,000
link to in terms of reporting so folks

392
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,100
can go ahead if they don't understand a

393
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,959
certain terminology go to the glossary

394
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,940
and see what it actually means to the

395
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,240
organization and consistency use the

396
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,100
same terminology I know it's boring but

397
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,660
if you're going to refer to an adversary

398
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,940
in one paragraph a cyber criminal and

399
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,380
another and then threat actors later on

400
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,940
it might be confusing for the audience

401
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,399
so stick to one terminology adversary

402
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,680
throughout it makes it much much more

403
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,480
easy to follow in terms of your your

404
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,420
findings

405
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,880
standards examples if depending on your

406
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
organization if there's branding that's

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,940
involved make sure you use the proper

408
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,519
branding you can go through training for

409
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,959
that or you probably have a branding

410
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,240
resource in terms of icons and colors

411
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,779
and whatnot size of font Etc biases I

412
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,279
know there's been a lot of coverage over

413
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,620
the years in terms of biases you want to

414
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,180
keep those at Bay in terms of your

415
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,180
confirmation by bias your sampling bias

416
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,260
Etc

417
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,940
use your bottom line up fronts

418
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,760
especially at the top of your reports it

419
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,680
really lets the reader know what they're

420
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,079
in for and gets to the bottom line as

421
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,519
quickly as possible so that they don't

422
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,220
have to if it's not related to them read

423
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,540
through the entire report to understand

424
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,100
what it's about

425
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,440
Source reference resource citations I

426
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,060
talked about is that as well make sure

427
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,579
you're properly citating where you're

428
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:06,959
getting your information from your

429
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,180
sources and references and any resources

430
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,620
things such things such as date time

431
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,720
groups make sure there's uniformity

432
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,519
throughout your reporting

433
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,199
dates what's the difference between

434
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,540
between date of information and date of

435
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,740
acquisition they're actually really

436
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,660
different right or can be very different

437
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,220
those are different from date of report

438
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,959
so make sure that you have Clarity there

439
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,820
because really pegging your information

440
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,920
to a date when it was last known to be

441
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,779
good in terms of that information is

442
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,779
really important for your report times

443
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,579
and and you can see language there as

444
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,720
well keep all those things in

445
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,040
consideration in terms of your

446
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,259
storytelling

447
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,139
now dissemination delivering a solid

448
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,480
product so

449
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,160
one of the things here that you want to

450
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,980
include in your report and these are all

451
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,779
if you think of the grimoire of codex

452
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,160
these are all little nuggets of

453
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,899
resources that you're going to use to

454
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,940
write your report but a lot of this

455
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,100
content that I'm going over is is not

456
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,040
really taking up too much real estate

457
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,559
within your report for example veracity

458
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,839
your source and information this could

459
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,660
boil down to two letters right it could

460
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,020
be using in this particular case the

461
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,299
admirality system to

462
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,119
uh evaluates and assess your sorcery

463
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,419
reliability and your data accuracy or

464
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,740
your item credibility

465
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,859
so for example using the system a is

466
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,480
completely reliable

467
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,480
for over in the other column is doubtful

468
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
so if you have a source with information

469
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,380
that's A4 you can rely on that Source

470
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,240
but the credibility of the information

471
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,820
might be bad so this is you know one

472
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,039
little component in terms of veracity

473
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,900
and providing to the actual reader

474
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,640
your assessment in terms of the source

475
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,020
and the item in terms of its credibility

476
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,179
these could also be built into your

477
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,039
confidence levels which again is another

478
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,500
small component maybe of the overall

479
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,900
report maybe just one sentence that

480
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,720
the CTI team has moderate confidence

481
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,059
that blah blah blah blah okay so this is

482
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,740
just another example here from The Joint

483
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,799
Chiefs and staff joint publication 2.0

484
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,440
of how you can determine veracity and

485
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,679
convey that confidence level so low

486
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,440
moderates and high

487
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,980
okay so another in in terms of conveying

488
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,860
your findings or disseminating your

489
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,740
products and making sure that the uh the

490
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,320
actual consumer the reader understands

491
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,880
um

492
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,340
the the actual findings in context is

493
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,640
using uh assessing your gaps and

494
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,559
caveating the findings within your

495
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,140
report maybe you have some challenges in

496
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,360
terms of obtaining the evidence or the

497
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,799
information that was turned into

498
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,080
intelligence maybe you don't have a

499
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,940
complete picture maybe for internal

500
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,620
Telemetry you don't have full coverage

501
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,120
in a certain region

502
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,179
limitations maybe uh the tool that

503
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,039
you're leveraging has some limitations

504
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,380
in terms of the details that they

505
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,940
provide or maybe there's some

506
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,520
constraints that are limiting what your

507
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,860
collection analysis was or maybe there's

508
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,960
some dependencies on things that you

509
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
actually can't control so this is also

510
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,120
known as your what we don't know what we

511
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,640
can't know what we want to know putting

512
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,460
everything into perspective making sure

513
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,559
that the audience understands that there

514
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,900
were some limitations challenges

515
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,880
constraints and dependencies in terms of

516
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,160
your report

517
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,679
so getting into the recommendations and

518
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,780
this is uh one of my favorite topics

519
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,100
because this is what the report really

520
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,559
what the product really boils down to is

521
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,740
the way forward in terms of uh what to

522
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,720
do next okay also known as

523
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,160
countermeasures or maybe they're they're

524
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,280
actually controls or the mitigations

525
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,660
um I've actually thought a lot about

526
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,700
this uh there's a bottom line up front

527
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,200
because at the top of the report and

528
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
I've often thought maybe we should have

529
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
a rough and sort of a bluff also have a

530
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,960
rough that's recommendations up front

531
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
puts those right at the top of the

532
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,280
report so the reader actually sees real

533
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,539
quick what they're in for and they can

534
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,940
go ahead and read the rest of the report

535
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,799
uh regardless of where you put your

536
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,299
recommendations

537
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,460
um these should be recommendations that

538
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,299
are are helpful they are actionable they

539
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,220
are relevant and they are valuable to

540
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,039
the organization so some of the ways of

541
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,780
conveying your recommendations would be

542
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,400
using some of the industry standards out

543
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,660
there and this is just three examples

544
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
here the center for Internet Security

545
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,160
controls the sys controls there's 18 of

546
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,600
them in version eight I believe it's

547
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,640
version that we're up to these are great

548
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,140
for tactical level countermeasure

549
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,120
Reliance in terms of reports you can

550
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,640
simply after your findings you can go

551
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,520
ahead into your recommendations and and

552
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,900
recommend that the organization go ahead

553
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,620
and follow however many of those 18

554
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,059
countermeasures in in the sub counter

555
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,700
measures that fall with assist controls

556
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,660
similarly with the minor attack

557
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,179
mitigations there's 43 of those they're

558
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,980
not very specific but they can be also

559
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,380
helpful in terms of relaying what

560
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,760
mitigations

561
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,620
um you're recommending based on the

562
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,020
findings report in a framework that's

563
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,240
understandable by the organization it

564
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,340
uses motor attack and these mitigations

565
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,320
do and can be mapped to the tactics and

566
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,480
techniques and then there's also the new

567
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,220
cyber security framework which is great

568
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,919
for operational and strategic planning

569
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:20,940
this is a framework that's actually

570
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,340
being reviewed right now for updates

571
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,380
um hopefully in the next couple years

572
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,179
um but this file this framework falls

573
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,460
into five functional areas with various

574
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,080
different categories underneath of those

575
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,240
areas so this is again a little bit more

576
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,340
operational strategic

577
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,840
um the miter attack mitigations are

578
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,360
operational in my opinion and then the

579
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,340
more tactical assist controls these are

580
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,520
just three examples so having this as

581
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,960
part of your framework that you leverage

582
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,120
and vocabulary that convey can really

583
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,640
really help out with those folks who are

584
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,960
reading your report and looking to take

585
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,500
action on your recommendations

586
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,299
so a few other things as you're closing

587
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,980
out writing your reports or putting your

588
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,799
slide deck together the markings

589
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,960
um your portion markings or your footer

590
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,080
and header marking so you can use a set

591
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,640
of cyber threat levels this is just one

592
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
example here from cisa the national

593
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,659
cyber incident scoring system that can

594
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,520
help convey the Cyber Threat Level that

595
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,200
you're recommending in your report or

596
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,659
the overall marking uh within your

597
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,179
report itself there's other cyber threat

598
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,100
levels that are out there FSI sac and hi

599
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,720
Sac from the mind

600
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,320
foreign

601
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,799
s there is always potentially a turning

602
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,539
client privilege or work product that

603
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,340
you want to consider if this is actually

604
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,500
an ACP type of product that you're

605
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,640
putting together

606
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,799
the organization likely has some kind of

607
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,539
data classification markings that are

608
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,880
required for the report or the slides

609
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
and then if this is only a draft you

610
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,000
want to make sure that it's clear that

611
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,559
this is a draft and not a final word

612
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,539
product

613
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,480
and then in terms of markings for

614
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,280
sharing if your your report's going to

615
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,679
be shared to other folks outside of your

616
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,659
organization you can Leverage The TLP

617
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,179
the traffic light protocol which is

618
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,320
something that was established by

619
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,799
first.org it's been updated there's TLP

620
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,960
red Amber and restrict green and clear

621
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,059
and you want to make sure that if you

622
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,919
are sharing this to another organization

623
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,960
that you understand these markings and

624
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,880
follow the guidelines in terms of how

625
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,960
your product should be marked

626
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,120
so in terms of review uh right before

627
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,280
you're doing the dissemination quality

628
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,900
assurance and quality control it's time

629
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,200
for the big red pen and in my in my time

630
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,740
doing reports I learned very early on

631
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,539
um not to take offense to anybody that's

632
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,700
that's marking up my report because I

633
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,380
always think it's going to be a better

634
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,419
report in the end especially if

635
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,640
somebody's relying on your intelligence

636
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
you want to make sure that you're

637
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
conveying your message clearly and it's

638
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,159
not misunderstood and you're including

639
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,659
everything that needs to be included in

640
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,620
that report so if you are reviewing

641
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,220
um typically organizations will have at

642
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,320
least two reviews a peer review and then

643
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,419
a senior leader review and when you

644
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,220
review some of the things you want to

645
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,720
check for is everything I just talked

646
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,020
about more specifically here readability

647
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,880
Clarity concise and consistency assume

648
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,400
you are the consumer and do not know

649
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,260
what the topic is about until you're

650
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,179
reading that report

651
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,220
standards branding and format grammar

652
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,679
active voice spelling punctuation making

653
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,299
sure you have proper citations for your

654
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,880
sources references and resources and

655
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,340
then if you're providing feedback track

656
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,559
your changes and use comment bubbles for

657
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,740
that

658
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,140
okay evaluation so obtaining actionable

659
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,080
feedback and again your evaluation and

660
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,940
your feedback can happen throughout your

661
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,500
your report writing cycle or your

662
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,240
intelligence cycle

663
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,919
at the end here's what we're talking

664
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,460
about in terms of ways that you can

665
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,659
solicit feedback so one of the more uh

666
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,460
popular ways in my mind and how I grew

667
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,780
up in the intelligence Community was

668
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,640
formalize evaluations from the analysts

669
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,320
to reading the reports

670
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,419
so the consumers provide feedback and

671
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,100
rate the product impact maybe they're

672
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,320
using things such as major significance

673
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,539
high value of value low value no value

674
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,820
and this helps you out is is your

675
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,860
products meeting the needs of the

676
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,020
consumers and what is what is their

677
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,360
feedback and if your product is no value

678
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,400
you just don't throw in a towel you look

679
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,960
at it and you learn from it and improve

680
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,460
your products in the future it's a whole

681
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,559
reason we're having feedback the survey

682
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,539
forms are another way to get feedback

683
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,340
sending periodic surveys to your

684
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,860
intelligence consumers using tools such

685
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,140
as forums or Google Microsoft forms or

686
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,640
Google forms

687
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,799
audience pools I know we're going to be

688
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,360
doing polls for this presentation so

689
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,000
during briefings assessions assess your

690
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,860
audience knowledge level but also

691
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,539
request feedback during or at the end of

692
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:46,620
the session

693
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,840
then finally informal discussions set up

694
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,299
meetings with your consumers and ask

695
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,320
them

696
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,240
um are you getting the products are

697
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,679
these actionable are these meeting your

698
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,020
needs if not what can we do to improve

699
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,179
these products

700
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,919
so that brings us here to the end of the

701
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
report writer's grimoire we've filled in

702
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,779
all of these different areas I know this

703
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,480
is a huge topic didn't have much time to

704
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,279
cover everything in detail but hopefully

705
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,100
this will help give you

706
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,200
um a way forward in terms of develop

707
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,720
your own grimoire or codex if you final

708
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,059
thoughts I see Willian just uh getting

709
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,760

710
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,320

711
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,980

product to their level

719
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,860
take a structured approach to writing

720
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,140
use an outline use report templates

721
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,600
use common Frameworks and vocabulary be

722
