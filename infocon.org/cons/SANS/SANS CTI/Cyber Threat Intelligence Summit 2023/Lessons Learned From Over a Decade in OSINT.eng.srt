1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,960
from over a decade in oh Sam right who

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,820
the heck am I well she just said I'm a

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,040
certified science instructor the author

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,680
of the Sans SEC 497 host course the new

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,460
one

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,500
I was a federal agent just retired over

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,359
21 years of federal law enforcement

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,400
found in multiple o sent units within

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,560
the government had outside work off the

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,300
rise for most of my career so I've done

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,439
a lot of that I've spoken a podcast

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,480
spoken a wired but it's kind of funny

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,300
when it comes to CTI I joke that like I

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,020
totally cheat my wife uh ran CTI for a

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,300
fortune hundred company and still works

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,700
there so you know between like uh

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
working with her working on the things

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
that I've worked with the one thing that

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
it's given me is definitely kind of a a

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,739
well-rounded Viewpoint of a lot of

22
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,239
what's going on from both public sector

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,760
and private sector and so there's just a

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,020
few things that I thought would be kind

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,020
of a fun to share today agenda no time

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,719
for this right only half an hour talk

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,539
so one thing that I want to talk about

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,519
is just kind of those sent roles and how

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,400
they've been changing recently right

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,420
historically those that roles have been

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,159
relatively well defined if you talk to

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,020
people well a Duo said well who do you

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,760
work for a law enforcement beautiful

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,240
right short term quick hit disrupt

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,780
disgrade dismantle right like how can I

36
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,580
basically I'm focused on one you know

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,159
small group of individuals and hopefully

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,780
we can arrest them take them off the

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,900
streets and back on to the next one

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,979
intelligence agencies Department of

41
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,900
Defense tend to be more holistic a lot

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,759
of times maybe looking at like a

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,799
national level right or a region or an

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,259
industry something like that

45
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,540
private sector right everyone here is

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,820
very very familiar with these indicators

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,680
of compromise just different uh

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,180
different things like that you're like

49
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,860
what are the main threats in your

50
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,899
industry right what are the ttps what do

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,280
you need to look for these are the types

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,560
of things that we think historically is

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,979
in symbols and if we think of them as

54
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,259
like buckets of paint people tend to

55
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,880
think of it like a left-hand side well

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,740
you do this so this is what you do okay

57
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,560
you work here so this is what you do but

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,660
in the real world right it looks a lot

59
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,180
more like the light right these are all

60
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,580
just getting kind of mixed and Blended

61
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,040
in together and I've seen it from kind

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,620
of both sides from a law enforcement

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,080
side right in my day job you've saw this

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,660
because I've had analysts that no

65
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,920
disrespect to them just weren't

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,599
technical didn't have the training it

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,700
wasn't their experience and now they're

68
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,200
doing things like researching IP

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,480
addresses trying to figure out if it's a

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,000
VPN or where it's coming from or you

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
know some of the different things that

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,760
I've just seen and it's people like I

73
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,020
said they're trying to do the best they

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,879
can just don't really have that

75
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,980
knowledge that training that experience

76
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,879
on the flip side right I've seen private

77
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,720
second

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,760
right here's cyber threat intelligence

79
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,120
right hired to do technical work and all

80
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,620
of a sudden they're doing largely a lot

81
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,840
of times like law enforcement rules I

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,700
can remember in a 2020 when there was a

83
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,200
lot of civil unrest here in the United

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,660
States you know my wife getting phone

85
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,540
calls like hey I just got off the subway

86
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,360
like I'm supposed to go into work but it

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,739
doesn't look like it's safe for me to

88
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,540
enter the building or not

89
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,580
or you know vice versa like hey I've

90
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,340
been in this building for 16 hours I

91
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,720
don't think it's safe for me to leave

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,819
what do you think right there's some

93
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,400
persistent monitoring Twitter code that

94
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,959
I wrote for uh when I looked at the

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,459
government just to help me out in my day

96
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,319
job I actually gave a talk on and

97
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,060
released the code of the Sans osef

98
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,580
Summit the year before last and I come

99
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,560
to find out like after 2020 there was

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,840
two large companies private sector

101
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
companies who were actually running that

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,980
code trying to figure out right is it

103
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,599
basically forced protection mission

104
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,480
right trying to keep their people safe

105
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,060
and so like I said you see this blending

106
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,739
right you see once again private sector

107
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,959
running down threats to executives

108
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,000
right kind of what we jokingly refer to

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
sometimes as a bag of bounties right

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,920
Anonymous email addresses saying they

111
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,299
found vulnerabilities but they want to

112
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,040
get paid right all these types of things

113
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,720
that are going on

114
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,239
why does this matter I think people in

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,080
the space understand what I'm saying and

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,459
know that it's happening because you

117
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,799
witness it too but why does it matter

118
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,738
right why do we care a couple months ago

119
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,600
I got asked if I wanted to come on

120
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,880
Quantico and give a talk to a bunch of

121
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Executives heads of security with

122
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,639
Fortune 500 companies so ciso csos Etc

123
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,740
and I'm like yeah that actually sounds

124
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,139
like a blast and that morning when I was

125
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,840
driving on base I drove right by here

126
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,060
and I stopped pulled over my rental car

127
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,360
I got out and I just kind of enjoyed it

128
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
for a minute or two took this picture

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,440
and quoted it on and what this is this

130
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,419
is the the long range rifle range that

131
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,820
are on Quantico and the Marine base and

132
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,620
it reminded me of a book that I read

133
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,600
when I was a little kid it was about a

134
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,220
gentleman named Carlos Hathcock who's

135
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,040
one of the most decorated snipers in U.S

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,020
military history was in the Vietnam War

137
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,479
and I read this book on him when I was a

138
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,040
little kid and I've forgotten most of

139
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,440
the book but there's one story that has

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,900
stuck with me to this day even as an

141
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,800
adult and what it was was

142
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,780
he was on a mission

143
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,940
and he had planned it out he was going

144
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,320
to go to this certain point and then

145
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,780
take a shot he's by himself middle of

146
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,300
nowhere he was exhausted hadn't slept in

147
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,600
a couple days hungry thirsty where I

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
just absolutely on the verge of mentally

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,780
breaking and he was close to where he

150
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,820
was needed to get to but he wasn't quite

151
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,039
there yet but then he looked at his

152
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,900
Target and he thought

153
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,479
I can make this from here

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,699
I can make this shot all the time in

155
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,860
training and no I can make this shot

156
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,000
from here

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
why don't I just take the shot from here

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,020
and then I can get the heck out of here

159
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,740
and go be safe right and he talked about

160
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,840
in the book this mental struggle this

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,060
argument that he had inside of himself

162
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,039
of

163
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,900
I want to take a shot from here I know I

164
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,060
can do it why am I going to wait and try

165
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,740
to get to where I would really plan to

166
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,199
versus having this conversation with

167
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,720
himself would listen you are exhausted

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
you are hungry you are thirsty you are

169
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
in the verge of mentally breaking

170
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
you made the original plan when you were

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
well rested

172
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,660
right when you were fed

173
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,060
but we'll need more thirsty all of these

174
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,160
things why are you going to abandon our

175
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,979
plan that you made when you were relaxed

176
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,919
and thinking clearly versus right now

177
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,500
when you're just broke right and he

178
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,940
actually stuck with it and followed

179
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,440
through with the plan right and it's

180
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,199
just I just like I said that story just

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,060
always stuck with me it always reminds

182
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,979
me like there's something that I hate

183
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,539
and I've done a lot of digital forensics

184
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,460
too and one thing that I hate and

185
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,560
sometimes it's unavoidable I hate doing

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
something for the first time when it

187
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,680
matters

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,600
right it's like oh okay well you're

189
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,160
gonna you know the same in this device

190
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,020
you know do this type of thing it's like

191
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,940
man I really wish I'd done this before

192
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,860
like I really wish I had one to practice

193
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,539
on right and sometimes you can make that

194
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,180
happen and sometimes you can't right but

195
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,620
if you've done something before wouldn't

196
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,600
it for lack of a better term like

197
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,940
doesn't matter right when it's just you

198
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,979
practicing then when it comes time to do

199
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,419
it right you're so much more confident

200
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,340
you're doing a better job it always

201
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,280
works for you so I realize that

202
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,639
sometimes it's unavoidable right I

203
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,860
realize that sometimes you're so busy

204
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,440
taking care of the things that you have

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
to do on a day in day out basis that you

206
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,639
don't have time to prepare for the

207
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,199
things that you're currently not having

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,400
to work on

209
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
but that's one of the things that you

210
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,580
can provide a lot of value in by coming

211
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,039
to places like here at these Summits and

212
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,660
talking to other people to talk about

213
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,460
what they're dealing with because then

214
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,319
it makes you think like well shoot what

215
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,360
happens if I deal with that am I ready

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,340
right maybe if at all possible I should

217
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,720
kind of take the time and sort of

218
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
prepare for some of these things now or

219
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,020
at least get a little more familiar with

220
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,479
it and so then when the time comes I'm

221
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,160
better equipped to deal with it so you

222
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,139
always kind of keep that in mind and

223
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,759
like I said it's really good sometimes

224
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
having some of these groups right where

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,900
we can kind of exchange ideas and hear

226
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,639
what other people are struggling with to

227
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,840
help them be better prepared because

228
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,580
you'll probably end up facing it

229
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,220
eventually too

230
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,460
all right best practices for starting

231
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,259
with osin Team I've started a few of

232
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,000
these right in both the Tactical level

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,720
and at the headquarters level and both

234
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,919
times

235
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,259
some of my very first meetings were with

236
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,240
legal I think really worried so when I

237
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,700
say work was legal I don't just say that

238
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,260
is like lip service right it's not just

239
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,820
oh yeah you should probably look illegal

240
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,779
like no no I I really meant it and

241
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,440
yeah I never

242
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
warranted like what I did never

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,560
warranted a full-time attorney right

244
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,240
thankfully I wouldn't have wanted to do

245
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,140
it frankly but I would need to get legal

246
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,660
advice on a somewhat regular basis and

247
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,940
just run things by people and so what I

248
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,860
did is I was thankful I have two U.S

249
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,839
attorneys who I was not their full-time

250
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
job I never wanted to be their full-time

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,519
job but when we were first forming that

252
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,019
relationship we spent a little bit of

253
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,880
extra time together and they got to

254
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,000
understand what my unit was doing

255
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,560
what are

256
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
more we could ask those questions and

257
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,760
then they were comfortable right and

258
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,920
that's what

259
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,779
I could reach out to one of those two

260
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,459
right it has to be two because if you

261
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,500
have one you've got none right between

262
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,600
leave and everything else

263
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,160
so I had these two people that I could

264
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,200
reach out to and ask them a question

265
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,839
without having to set up the background

266
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,600
of who we were and what we did right and

267
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,459
that's huge and I think a great example

268
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,620
of how they can be huge is right here

269
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,839
this is a photo I took in a back room

270
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,640
that was under construction at an

271
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,500
international airport and I was sitting

272
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,240
there one day minding my business and I

273
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,459
got a phone call from another agency and

274
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,600
they said hey

275
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,279
we would love for you to get to this

276
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,740
International Airport and post stuff in

277
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,380
this you know basically get set up in a

278
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,779
room there

279
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,459
and we have a high value Target that's

280
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,260
going to be getting off a plane

281
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,899
and we think we can get you about five

282
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,839
minutes alone with our devices

283
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,600
what kind of devices are they don't know

284
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,519
all right Roger that and it was

285
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,260
basically like if you're cool with this

286
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,180
and you need to basically leave now

287
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,800
right you've got about a two hour window

288
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,260
but we need to get you there now

289
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm like okay give me a few minutes

290
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,180
I called up one of the two attorneys

291
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,040
saying this isn't called this is what

292
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,140
they want to do and I got

293
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,180
okay you think you're fine doing this

294
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,180
and this just don't do the service

295
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,959
sounds good let's go do it right and the

296
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,720
reason why that was so important is I

297
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,519
was able to call up and get a quick

298
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,200
answer get a quick opinion and then go

299
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,660
do what I was told needed to do imagine

300
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,820
if I had called just a generic Duty

301
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,260
pager one

302
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,060
okay I got an attorney that I'd never

303
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,440
worked with before

304
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,300
like there would have been zero chance

305
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,860
of this actually being able to happen it

306
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,500
ended up being a very successful op

307
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,899
P who is this again what do you do

308
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,420
what's the name of your unit who's your

309
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,440
boss

310
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
okay one more time what's your name

311
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
right all of these questions right and

312
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,760
it's tough I get that I realize that

313
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,620
it's tough sometimes but that's the

314
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,060
thing like I said if at all possible

315
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,519
forming that relationship and so

316
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,260
sometimes when you can get to be a quick

317
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,240
opinion you can kind of make that happen

318
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,860
without having to set up all the

319
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,600
background

320
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,660
foreign work with legal right like I

321
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,579
said I'm not just paying lip service to

322
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,760
that like I truly truly mean it but try

323
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,100
to be very careful

324
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,380
to not put more constraints on your team

325
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,940
in the law does right and a lot of us

326
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,800
here this may not be our decisions but

327
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,779
hopefully we can at least have some

328
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,000
input now what am I talking about this

329
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,980
right not putting more constraints in

330
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,500
your team than the law does there are a

331
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,640
lot of and this is something that I

332
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
talked about with the the executives

333
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,779
over security when I was kind of talking

334
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,459
about starting up and posting weird a

335
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,600
few months ago

336
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,880
there are a lot of decisions that you

337
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,279
can make early on based on advice from

338
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,339
legal that seem reasonable but will end

339
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,620
up completely hamstringing your

340
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,079
investigations down right things like

341
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
violating terms and services

342
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,980
how many Facebook accounts are you

343
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,360
allowed to have

344
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,579
what does the name have to be your real

345
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,440
name right one account real name there

346
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,940
it is right other things you're

347
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,459
violating the terms and services and so

348
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,200
it's very easy for someone to come up

349
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,940
with an opinion of like well we're not

350
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,920
going to violate terms of services

351
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,779
okay great but then you can hand screen

352
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,339
your future investigations all right

353
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,040
what happens when some information is

354
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,500
posted on a site somewhere you want to

355
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,240
go see that information

356
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,459
but you don't want to use your real

357
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,320
accounts to go see it right your real

358
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,940
name and don't want that to be tied to

359
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,339
you well now what do you do you either

360
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,680
don't see that information or if you ask

361
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
someone else you try to circumvent it

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
unfortunately what you see a lot of

363
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,839
times is people are asked to do

364
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:01,920
something

365
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,480
they're just trying to get the job done

366
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,920
and so they don't use their personal

367
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,260
information to do it right and that's

368
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,320
unfortunate so try to kind of have that

369
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
conversation point out like hey there

370
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,519
are times when we may want to make

371
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,160
accounts under names that are not ours

372
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,860
to go read this data right and just kind

373
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,180
of know what you're hamstring yourself

374
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,240
if you don't do that big one utilizing

375
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,760
breach data all right that was a couple

376
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,980
months ago I was listening to a podcast

377
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,600
and then we're talking to an associate

378
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,519
expert and at the very end of the

379
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,839
podcast the host asked this guest

380
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,480
what do you think about breach data and

381
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,940
the guest said I I would never use

382
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,160
bridge data never I don't see any

383
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
difference between using breach data

384
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,620
and buy is stolen property and the

385
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,480
podcast host is like yeah I agree I feel

386
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,459
the same way and I just kind of shook my

387
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,579
head and I didn't think less

388
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,399
of the guest I really didn't I get it

389
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,800
but it made me think like okay they

390
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,959
probably just have a very narrow set of

391
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,940
experiences right because I start

392
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,500
thinking of all the times that I have

393
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,600
gone and gotten breach data for a

394
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
purpose that I felt was very very good

395
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,459
right think back to well a little over a

396
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,320
year ago when word go out that hey

397
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
Wallace have been popped and there was

398
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
vulnerability scans for customers

399
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,680
sitting there on the dark web I had

400
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,480
public and private sector companies

401
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,940
reaching out to me hey and you have this

402
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,040
can you get it can you let us know what

403
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,779
our information is in there we use this

404
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,480
and it ended up being like the

405
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,459
information posted wasn't that big of a

406
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,399
deal in all honesty but I was able to

407
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,560
grab the data kind of look through real

408
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,720
quick do some quick trioshing and let

409
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,060
them know what was out there right that

410
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,420
is a very very good in my opinion right

411
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,720
use of breach data numerous times

412
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,339
breaches come out there and I have

413
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,959
organizations call me up I remember the

414
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,300
MGM specifically and a Fortune 500

415
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,980
company reached out hey

416
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,500
some of our Executives think that they

417
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,300
may have sensitive information in there

418
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,699
can you get a copy and let us know yeah

419
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,320
absolutely right we can check that out

420
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,540
we can make that happen and so these are

421
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,220
the types of things once again if you're

422
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
deciding not to do that as a policy just

423
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,079
know that there may be a time when you

424
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,459
regret that and then at that point

425
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,380
you're kind of fest with what do you do

426
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,139
right you either have a blind spot or an

427
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,940
I.E violate policy and I don't like

428
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,860
either one of those things and that kind

429
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,480
of goes the same thing with visiting the

430
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,040
dark web right it kind of goes hand in

431
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
hand with the breach data I'm not saying

432
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,279
you should do it I'm not saying you

433
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,540
shouldn't do it

434
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,519
but by putting more constraints on

435
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,079
yourself than the law does like I said

436
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,519
you can get yourself in a position where

437
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,620
you're choosing to be a blind spot or

438
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,420
violating your policy like I said I

439
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,040
don't like either of those two options

440
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,480
if just a quick little aside there right

441
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,980
if in the scope of your team's research

442
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,740
activities looking at employees mixer HR

443
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,740
is involved in my career I was never uh

444
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,839
Internal Affairs you know Inspector

445
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,240
General anything like that but you know

446
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,920
my technical skills I would sometimes

447
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,019
get tasks to kind of held out and at

448
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,639
those points I may be the one doing the

449
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,260
technical work but they're the ones

450
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,060
driving what I'm doing right they're the

451
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,860
ones telling me what I should do what I

452
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,240
shouldn't do what I'm looking for when

453
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,860
you just try to stay in that lane so

454
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,480
it's like you may be the one doing the

455
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,040
technical work but you make sure that

456
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,339
they're the ones driving the efforts

457
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,160
all right this is a fun topic to talk

458
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,920
about upset and it's fun

459
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,079
and it's challenging right I say one of

460
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,519
the most challenging topics to discuss

461
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
and as I said I think it probably is the

462
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
most challenging personally it's

463
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,060
fundamentally important

464
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,399
but the requirements can vary great I

465
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
will talk about that and there's a lot

466
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,259
of definitions for what opsec is but at

467
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,579
the end of the day it's really just kind

468
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,680
of like a mismanagement framework right

469
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
and I think a lot of us understand that

470
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,000
you can never eliminate the risk right

471
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,160
you can only reduce it and at that point

472
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,019
you either accept what's left and do the

473
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,180
work or you don't you don't right that's

474
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,500
what it is

475
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,160
a key lesson though is you can't have

476
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,859
good offset retroactivity and this kind

477
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,000
of goes at what we were just talking

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,799
about a minute ago is you see people

479
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,260
sometimes of okay we're not we can't go

480
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,119
to these sites and do these things okay

481
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,240
until all of a sudden something happens

482
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,640
and now it's important to your loss now

483
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,740
it's important to an executive or a VIP

484
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,260
someone and so now just make it happen

485
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,660
or at the old famous just make it happen

486
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,780
well now you have people going there and

487
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,580
visiting an account using their personal

488
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,020
information

489
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,360
right or okay fine I'll make a sock

490
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,799
puppet account real quick I'll make an

491
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,080
account under a fake name but you need a

492
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,120
phone number I'll shoot now I'll just

493
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,980
use my personal phone number to kind of

494
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,419
verify that but it doesn't matter no one

495
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,400
will ever see this only this service has

496
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,440
it and you know it's never going to be a

497
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,640
big deal

498
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,860
all fun and games right until breach

499
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,039
navigates out there until 262 million

500
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,080
Facebook accounts tied to phone numbers

501
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,059
get out there and you start putting

502
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,400
these pieces together right you can't

503
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,460
have good opsec retroactively and I

504
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,840
think a very good example of that was

505
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,780
this one right here uh several years ago

506
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,660
right back in 2014 there was a big it

507
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,299
was kind of the first big leak of nude

508
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,400
photos of certain celebrities

509
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
and before this hit right before it was

510
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
news the night before an anonymous

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,799
person with a username of blunt

512
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,160
Mastermind on Reddit posted one of these

513
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,240
pictures

514
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,100
right kind of posted they had it one

515
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,020
more before I go to bed because I'm kind

516
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,480
and posted a picture there

517
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,120
the next day

518
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,160
this kind of hit big

519
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,960
right the news that there was a leak was

520
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,880
out there this was all over everywhere

521
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,240
on the internet on the news

522
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,700
and presumably what happened is

523
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,760
Brian Hamad right this individual who

524
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,200
will talk to how he got to him in a

525
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,419
minute and woke up that morning

526
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,720
saw that oh this is big news and they

527
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
didn't just go back and delete that post

528
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,860
blunt Master but I didn't go back and

529
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,960
delete that post they blew away their

530
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,900
entire account obliterated they were

531
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,820
ready it was gone

532
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,299
someone that morning woke up saw that

533
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,280
was news thought I remember user

534
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,160
Mastermind last night already posting

535
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
some of these photos I went to find that

536
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,360
thread and it was gone and The

537
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,820
Mastermind user account was gone

538
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,740
but whoever this person is they're like

539
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,660
it's the internet and I know how it

540
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,940
works and they started putting it

541
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,760
together and using resources like

542
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
archive.org right and other techniques

543
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,340
we kind of talk about in the osin class

544
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,940
to basically step by methodical step put

545
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,160
together who this was and going and

546
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,559
finding Old Post of blaster mod that had

547
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,200
been archived on other places and just

548
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,120
step by step like one time blunt

549
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,059
Mastermind made a comment on someone

550
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,580
posted about the laws in Texas regarding

551
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,440
Teslas and electric vehicles

552
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,900
and Mastermind posted yeah it's the same

553
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,660
here in Georgia yeah cool you live in

554
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,720
Georgia right step by methodical step

555
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,000
figured out that whoever this person was

556
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,799
they worked at the southern digital

557
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,000
media team

558
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,160
and at first glance you kind of look at

559
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,940
these and you're like all right if

560
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,260
anyone's hanging on the internet looking

561
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,240
for nude photos it's this kid right here

562
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,679
right it's a little Skippy the intern

563
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,799
down in the right hand side but in

564
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,020
another masterminds reply someone had

565
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,820
been talking about their um

566
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,039
like a stocking issue that offended

567
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,539
theirs is dealing with and what

568
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,520
Mastermind replied they had my sisters

569
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,380
dealt with that before Oh we have a

570
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,120
sister oh skip he didn't have a sister

571
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,539
but Brian Hamad did step by methodical

572
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,860
step identifying who Mastermind was even

573
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,240
though it'd be a talent had been

574
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
completely obliterated and destroyed

575
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,179
once again very very difficult to have

576
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,960
good opsec retroactively

577
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,059
when I first started in my first osync

578
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,860
unit I was told we had no budget right

579
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,720
no equipment no training no tools no

580
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,280
nothing and it sounds like a joke but

581
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,320
it's true one nice thing about that is

582
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,299
it makes your decisions very very easy

583
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,860
right you start to learn what matters

584
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,600
what you're going to accomplish for free

585
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,760
they're very very cheap

586
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,280
and so we talked about this four slides

587
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
ago we kind of mentioned it as a concept

588
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,039
but opsec is the Spectrum right on the

589
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,840
left hand side we have no opsec I'm

590
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,179
using my personal computer my personal

591
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,960
browser right I've got Gmail open in one

592
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,299
Tab and then I've got Facebook logged in

593
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,860
with my personal account researching a

594
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,080
Target on the next title right we don't

595
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,240
want that we don't want that offset

596
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,520
on the right hand side the far right we

597
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,679
have the best offset money combined and

598
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,179
I've seen this and I've been involved

599
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,100
with these operations right we're just

600
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,380
huge budgets everything else some

601
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,480
amazing steps being done going against

602
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,120
like nation state level hackers

603
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,460
and those steps are good but they're

604
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,039
overkill for about 99 of the people out

605
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,440
there right and so what's important I

606
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,720
think for people to realize listen

607
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,039
you're not going to get here you're

608
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,140
almost assuredly not going to get right

609
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,760
here to the far right the best offset

610
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,799
money combine if you are and it's more

611
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,140
than you God bless you right but you can

612
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,360
get here you can get close very very

613
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,460
cheaply without much money and without

614
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,020
much effort right those are the areas

615
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,480
where I like to focus on good bang for

616
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,120
the buck why it matters is you may think

617
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,500
I'm just going to Twitter I'm just going

618
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,539
to Facebook I'm giving up say my IP

619
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,340
address to them who really cares well

620
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,620
and so you click on a link to leave that

621
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,299
site right and some of these like link

622
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,600
forwarders or link shorteners like bitly

623
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,780
they won't let you track the IP address

624
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,179
and certain browser information about

625
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,860
everyone who clicks through on that link

626
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,840
right we've seen this there was an

627
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,520
individual a few years ago that thought

628
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,500
that law enforcement was the monitor

629
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,900
event potentially and so they had some

630
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,340
pictures and instead of posting those

631
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,900
pictures to Facebook they posted them

632
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,820
somewhere else and then on their

633
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,400
Facebook they posted a link to the

634
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,900
pictures

635
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,299
and they were monitoring the IP address

636
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,740
of everyone who clicked through on the

637
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,480
link and there was a lot of law

638
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,039
enforcement who were clicking on the

639
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,720
link without managing their attribution

640
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,880
and their IP address was coming back to

641
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,919
the agency they're worked for and if

642
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,240
you're wondering how we know this like

643
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,799
well did you end up arresting later on

644
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,000
and they were telling you what they did

645
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,760
they were calling out the agencies on

646
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,280
their Facebook page oh looks like this

647
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
department is looking at me well looks

648
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,760
like this Department's looking at me now

649
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,159
too calling about on the Facebook page

650
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,260
right like thankfully I wasn't a ball

651
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,700
with this I just kind of had a flat row

652
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,679
seat and it was just fascinating to

653
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,900
watch right just absolutely fascinated

654
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,080
to watch and so this one of the numerous

655
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,179
examples I could sit here all day about

656
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,520
why we want to manage our attribution

657
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,080
why it matters

658
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,539
some of the best values if you have no

659
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,940
budget whatsoever poor browser does a

660
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,620
good job right nothing is perfect with

661
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,780
the core browser that's a very very good

662
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,600
job it's slow you get a captcha every 38

663
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,820
seconds right but it's free and it does

664
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,260
a good job of helping you manage your

665
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,020
attribution if you have a little bit of

666
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,780
money write a VPN very cheap but a good

667
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,020
job I personally don't use a free VPN

668
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,539
right use one that you pay for some

669
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,000
people use like Nord and proton I have

670
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,580
zero issues with that I personally use

671
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,100
one called private internet access there

672
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,200
have been other VPN providers that claim

673
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,360
that they keep no logs but then in order

674
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,640
to produce logs they have private

675
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,159
internet access claims that keep no logs

676
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,780
and when order to produce they have

677
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,919
always failed to produce and they

678
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,539
haven't been jerks about it they're just

679
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,700
like we keep no logs right and I like

680
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,559
that and it's not even that I'm doing

681
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,299
you know kind of joke I try to minimize

682
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,980
the number of felons that I can be on

683
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,840
any given day or say minimized because

684
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,299
I'm a realist but I don't want logs of

685
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,700
what I'm doing down there right and we

686
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,159
have seen VPN providers get hacked and

687
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,200
that breach data coming out here and so

688
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,299
then people that are trying to use vpns

689
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,460
to protect their privacy all of a sudden

690
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,260
now all of their information is leaked

691
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,059
out right and even if they were using it

692
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,100
on a mobile device things like the IMEI

693
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,200
certain selectors about the phone itself

694
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,200
so so that's why I want one that truly I

695
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,200
believe keeps no logs virtual machines

696
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,260
right VMware Player is free

697
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,900
right it is yeah we want to things like

698
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,700
that we're free so this gives you once

699
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,280
again it's not nothing is perfect but

700
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,620
that extra layer of like a Sandbox

701
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,200
between looking at websites maybe you

702
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,820
know viewing documents a layer of

703
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,100
separation between that and your actual

704
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,360
host system with your personal

705
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,700
information on it so these are ways for

706
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,760
very very free for free or very cheaply

707
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,100
right that we can really kind of make

708
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,520
ourselves uh so maybe not perfect but

709
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,220
close to that that's important

710
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,720
but we want to be careful not to let

711
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,419
perfectly the energy of good

712
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,000
you need a phone number to sign up for

713
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,919
most sites right there are things out

714
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,539
there like this is on eBay on the left

715
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,700
hand side this is TracFone from TracFone

716
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,100
direct it's an Android phone with the

717
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,840
years worth of service for 70 bucks

718
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,820
right I've done things like this

719
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,279
numerous times if you already have an

720
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,200
old phone laying around or at one of my

721
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
favorite methods is mint mobile the SIM

722
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,159
card provider that's gotten a lot more

723
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,900
popular now you see Ryan Reynolds as

724
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,880
their commercials looks like T-Mobile's

725
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
trying to take them over so we'll see

726
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,020
what happens it's 15 a month for a plan

727
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,299
which is great but

728
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,419
what they do is if you have a phone and

729
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,919
you want to test well how's the service

730
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,039
at my house right you can get a SIM card

731
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,520
that is good for one normally the the

732
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,500
retail price should be five dollars

733
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,740
they're almost always 99 Cents right

734
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,080
almost always 99 Cents and I've gone

735
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,520
down and got these from like Best Buy

736
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,980
before just paying cash with it on

737
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,919
Amazon it's a limit one purchase

738
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,620
at a time and so you can see when I took

739
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,260
this uh screenshot on my Amazon profile

740
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,539
at eight different times I've purchased

741
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,400
one of these one week seven months right

742
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,539
they work

743
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,580
you have a phone number for a week set

744
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,020
up a set of accounts you're good to go

745
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,760
you need to keep the accounts more long

746
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,500
term because of Any Panic at something

747
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,940
like this right if you don't want the

748
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,080
accounts to actually if you don't want

749
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,120
to lose them if they ever challenge I

750
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,500
want you to prove that you're actually

751
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,240
going to say you are again but these are

752
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,419
once again three easy ways right said

753
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,039
you think ah just real quick I need an

754
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,120
account so I'm just going to use my

755
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,500
personal number

756
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,120
it's all fun and games until the data

757
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,799
ends up coming out of spreadshaven and

758
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,740
we've seen it from so many sites right

759
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,299
it just it really seems at this point

760
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,279
like it's a matter of when not a matter

761
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,200
of death

762
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,380
so that is uh probably about all the

763
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,880
time we have we have like three minutes

764
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,039
more persistent monitoring persistent

765
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,740
monitoring is important right it is

766
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,960
worth doing and there are places like

767
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,940
Flashpoint that do an amazing job if you

768
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,400
have a budget if not Google Alerts are

769
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,640
free Twitter API keys are free right you

770
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,279
can do some amazing things with them and

771
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,360
I think one of the most underrated

772
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,100
things for persistent monitoring right

773
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,080
now are these Google programmable search

774
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,500
engines and the concept behind these are

775
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,260
if you come up with a very very good

776
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,080
Google search that say searches docs bid

777
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,360
and paste it and a few other sites and

778
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,980
it has some kind of modifiers on there

779
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,960
and so basically you've got this really

780
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,880
great search setup and all the only

781
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,500
thing you ever have to change is like a

782
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,480
name that you're looking for you can

783
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,700
freeze that search and save that search

784
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,559
until where now all you need to do is

785
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,000
type in the name that you're looking for

786
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,799
and the rest of that search is pretty

787
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,140
filled in and you can even share it with

788
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,940
your friends right that's kind of cool

789
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,340
kind of cool

790
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,380
but why is it here right why are we

791
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,600
talking about a persistent monitoring so

792
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,220
you can create a limited search like

793
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,539
that where you can leave your search

794
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,059
open for the entire web what does this

795
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,100
give you right why would you do that why

796
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,419
wouldn't you just use the main Google

797
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,720
you know page then well if you leave

798
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,460
your search wide open actually if you

799
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,559
don't it works either way but if you

800
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,260
look at this you can actually use these

801
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,120
with an API

802
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,580
right so you can write some python code

803
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,980
and you see there are 10 000 queries per

804
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,320
day so python code to automatically

805
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
search Google do your bidding with some

806
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
of your searches and to fire you an

807
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,100
alert if you want to when it finds a new

808
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,779
result or if you save them in a database

809
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,240
or whatever it is you want to do

810
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,179
right so here's some basic python code

811
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,279
that kind of monitors one of these

812
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,080
programmable search engines

813
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,620
it just lets me know if it hits an alert

814
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,080
and if you're thinking great

815
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
you know that you uh but you don't

816
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,500
really couldn't python that much it's on

817
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,320
your to-do list yeah chat GPT I didn't

818
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,840
even write this code chat GPT did right

819
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,520
and the modified it did other things

820
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,100
kind of to it but like I said this is a

821
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,020
very very neat sheet for sometimes

822
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,120
monitoring Google in a little bit more

823
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,679
controlled way than Google Alerts but

824
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,080
just Google Alerts Twitter API key you

825
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,539
can set up some fairly good persistent

826
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,520
monitoring efforts with just kind of uh

827
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,039
Dave Franklin some good common sense so

828
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,960
I'll pull open the slack window if you

829
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,580
have any questions or I want to be

830
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,899
interviewing any questions I know would

831
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,918
be the end of my time now

832
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:02,419
thank you
