1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,660
hey good morning everyone my name is

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,820
John Doyle as Katie said I am an

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,200
instructor candidate for the forensics

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,900
578 course and I also work for mandiant

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,460
as my day job

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,660
I'm here to talk to you guys about

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,880
career planning uh this is often one of

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
the kind of overlooked and more daunting

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,439
things that analysts have to deal with

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,480
um and I asked myself the question why

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,480
is that where a self-selected field of

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,940
highly intelligent individuals why is it

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,360
that this is a scary topic and the more

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,739
I kind of think about it the more I

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:38,940
realize

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,680
it's easier to get lost in the work that

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,420
we do and sometimes we kind of have to

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,399
pull ourselves back and make some

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,800
conscious decisions to actually focus on

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,300
investing in ourselves to have a

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,920
systematic way to plan our career where

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,719
we want to go

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,379
um

25
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,940
realizing that this is kind of a scary

26
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,399
topic I have gone through painstaking

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,039
efforts to make this as low maintenance

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
as possible right we're going to have

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,860
some fun we're going to enjoy ourselves

30
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm going to entertain you throughout as

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,280
well as provide you with a lot of

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,140
practical advice

33
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,000
um practical advice practical guidance

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,040
that I've kind of grown and learned over

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,080
the years learning from my peers as well

36
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,280
as myself

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,979
so without further Ado uh let me quickly

38
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,720
introduce who I am

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
according to a Kaspersky caricature

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,979
artist I have a very large forehead and

41
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,259
a fantastic beard

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,119
I think he was right on at least one of

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
those two counts

44
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,960
so

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,680
um

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,299
I work for Mandy and that's my day job

47
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,920
I've been in the field for about 15

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,860
years cyber security 15 years CTI 12 of

49
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,880
which my background is digital forensics

50
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,220
um I usually focus on supporting

51
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,780
operational and strategic Global

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,920
customers

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,140
at least I did when I was a analyst now

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,119
I'm a consultant helping build CTF

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,740
programs assess and mature and build

56
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,680
them on the roadmap I spent 10 years in

57
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,420
the government space working for the CIA

58
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,240
I was like the cissp and it's cheap in a

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,619
mile why just on all of the intrusion

60
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,060
sets

61
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,340
um where I decided to kind of pivot a

62
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,320
little bit got smart on North Korea and

63
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,780
Russia during my time though when I was

64
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,360
on that transnational team focused

65
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,640
looking across the board was the team

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,620
lead so I had the ability to kind of

67
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,120
influence decisions that leadership was

68
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
making I had a chance to kind of help

69
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,220
develop our Cadre

70
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,660
and part of that I think is going to

71
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,940
come out uh during some of the Practical

72
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,379
advice I get

73
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,920
so to make this entertaining

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,620
kind of we're going to make it immersive

75
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,420
I'm going to ask you a series of

76
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,660
questions

77
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,660
question number one buy show of hands

78
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,280
and don't worry people online I will

79
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
recap the results

80
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,580
show of hands

81
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,580
who is responsible for your career

82
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,840
who thinks it's senior leadership

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,620
these are not mutually exclusive by the

84
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,739
way I've got like three hands up four

85
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,080
five maybe okay

86
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,060
what about

87
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,280
first line supervisors

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,780
you can vote more than once guys it's

89
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,280
not mutually exclusive

90
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,260
okay so more hands are up now so we're

91
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,879
probably at about 20 to 30 percent in

92
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,140
the room

93
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,700
how about

94
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,819
human resources or people operations

95
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,319
yeah no

96
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,840
very sad like only four hands

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,519
you guys don't think highly of HR

98
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,599
how about you

99
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,400
you are in charge of your cure okay that

100
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,980
is exactly what I expected almost all of

101
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,980
the hands went up in the room fantastic

102
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,599
now I need you to repeat after me hi

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,819

I'm the problem it's me

106
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,159
Taylor Swift rude these people are not

107
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,739
the problem they are the solution

108
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,599
slight Public Service Announcement if

109
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,739

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,458
life-changing

114
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,220
okay question number two

115
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,379
who here has ever engaged in any sort of

116
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,540
formal career planning Beyond maybe an

117
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,819
annual career conversation

118
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,620
yes no

119
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,839
okay we've got a few hands up that's

120
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,978
fantastic

121
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,139
keep those hands up by the way

122
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,060
of those how many of you are managers

123
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,340
a fair amount okay cool are your direct

124
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,639
reports here

125
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,580
maybe not okay don't want to say totally

126
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,020
fine you're going to have some

127
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,280
interesting conversations coming out

128
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,419
this one

129
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,820
all right I love it let's get into the

130
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,979
substance

131
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm going to give you kind of a quick

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,580
overview of how we're going to progress

133
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,680
for the duration of this talk

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,720
I like to think of career planning as a

135
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,520
process because it really is right

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,080
there's multiple steps that go into it

137
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,060
it falls into multiple feedback loops

138
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,400
I've created a lot of mental models for

139
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,740
you as part of this so we'll start

140
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,360
talking about career planning as a

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,460
process we'll then move to taking an

142
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,139
inventory of our own skills

143
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,320
that is a fantastic starting point

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,600
we can understand where we are as

145
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,220
analysts developing in this profession

146
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,100
identify goals to move forward to

147
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,419
do a gap analysis identify milestones

148
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,940
identify ways in which we can satisfy

149
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,020
you know the equivalent of those

150
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,699
intelligence requirements or our skill

151
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,380
uplift

152
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,820
and then use that to feed into a

153
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,680
conversation with our leadership team so

154
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,060
thinking through how we can actually

155
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,539
plan strategically plan and smartly lead

156
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,600
us to how we develop career Maps

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
these road maps act as a fundamental

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,800
predicate for having career

159
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,500
conversations by the way it also acts as

160
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,479
a way for us to manage expectations with

161
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,979
our leadership team about what we want

162
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,720
to do so they can flag opportunities

163
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,300
that they see fit moving forward

164
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,180
super helpful to do more often than not

165
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,060
I find that analysts

166
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,620
usually as comes year end right they

167
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,820
expect to get promoted and they're not

168
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,100
disappointed and I usually ask the

169
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,080
question did you have a conversation

170
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,880
was your leadership aware of your

171
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,259
intentions

172
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,780
and I was like no I didn't okay they're

173
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,060
not mind readers and they have day jobs

174
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,759
so making your Ambitions known is kind

175
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,759
of key kind of a key predicate here

176
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,800
so we'll talk about that under the guise

177
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,100
of self-advocacy and uh as Rob Lee

178
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,380
pointed at a deeper Summit earlier in

179
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,319
the early late in 2022 finding your chat

180
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,840
finding those people who can help you

181
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,819
along the way

182
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,100
I'll wrap up with kind of a nice little

183
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,440
story and then some additional resources

184
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,860
for us

185
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,680
I like mental models

186
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,780
that is interesting

187
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,258
pause

188
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,819
for some reason my little diagram is not

189
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,919
showing okay picture this as a circular

190
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,500
diagram here

191
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,180
fabulous

192
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,340
I've created a very simplified mental

193
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,600
model here that starts with

194
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
understanding yourself

195
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,840
understanding what skills you have

196
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,979
available

197
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,380
we all come to this with a variety of

198
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,580
different skills

199
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,380
irrespective of whether you're just

200
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,940
brand new to CTI or whether you've been

201
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,280
a practitioner for years

202
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
having a good understanding of that

203
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,479
feeds them into a cycle we identify our

204
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:22,979
goals we understand where we want to

205
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,319
kind of grow and build to we look at

206
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,720
relevant timelines we put that on a

207
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,880
roadmap and we use that to facilitate a

208
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,319
discussion

209
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,580
that's kind of weird though there's a

210
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,960
facilitated discussion why aren't we

211
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,240
just kind of going full speed

212
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,819
well oftentimes we might have to ask for

213
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,340
resources those are out of our control

214
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,520
so instead we put it on a roadmap we get

215
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,380
executive buy-in we get buy-in for

216
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,560
resources and then we can move forward

217
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,060
periodically we will check in and

218
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,620
arguably you can put kind of a feedback

219
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,199
loop here in almost every one of these

220
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
steps along the way however I like to

221
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,099
think about it at the end you measure

222
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,720
against your milestones

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,240
every three months six months nine

224
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,740
months 12 months

225
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,259
is what I'm doing getting me closer to

226
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,280
my goals

227
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,259
are there ways that I can change my

228
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,759
workload are there things that I can do

229
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,000
outside of my daily activity that will

230
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,120
otherwise help me reach those goals

231
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,919
if you've had the conversation with your

232
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,180
leadership team and they've bought in

233
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,419
you can revisit this hey I have them on

234
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,740
my plate right now

235
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,539
it's not really helping me get to where

236
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,639
we agreed to is there things you can

237
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,440
take off and assign somebody else and I

238
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,419
can work on XYZ projects that will get

239
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,219
me towards my goals

240
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,760
cool

241
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,039
when we talk about career planning one

242
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,240
of the things that I like to point out

243
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,979
is

244
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,140
we have control over the things we

245
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,220
control

246
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,779
and we can influence the things we can

247
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,740
influence

248
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,959
there are going to be externalities

249
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,600
economics term externalities things we

250
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,860
can't control

251
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,980
but we can best position ourselves for

252
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,959
Optimal Solutions

253
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,040
so

254
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,720
what we'll try and do is we'll try and

255
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,700
position ourselves because it be a

256
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,920
planning process that will let us reach

257
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,620
those goals in a timely manner and

258
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,260
if for whatever reason we can that's a

259
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,540
discussion are my expectations out of

260
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,120
whack are they misaligned back when we

261
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,220
get there how can we build towards it

262
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,920
business needs will sometimes drive a

263
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,200
protracted timeline

264
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
for you reaching your goals

265
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,820
and then on the flip side luck sometimes

266
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,839
happens too

267
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,760
there are plenty of colleagues that I

268
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,440
used to work with that we colloquial

269
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,600
call them golden children they got

270
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,399
whatever they wanted that is not the

271
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
normal don't expect it to be normal so I

272
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,540
usually plan for worst case scenario and

273
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,040
go from there because then I'm

274
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,480
pleasantly surprised and I've managed my

275
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,080
own expectations

276
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,760
where do you start

277
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,339
that's a that's a tough question the

278
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,760
self-inventory is a perfect way to start

279
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,279
think of it like a character Street we

280
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,959
all have character sheets all of

281
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,760
attributes we all have traits

282
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,500
again irrespective of when we come in or

283
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
where we come in we all come in with

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
different skills those skills have

285
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
different scorings things that we can

286
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,399
measure against

287
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,760
natively intuitively

288
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,500
we may have different attribute

289
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,940
modifiers

290
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,120
so I think myself for example I am

291
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,580
soft-spoken I'm opinionated I am feisty

292
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,959
and I have this awesome red beard and

293
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,459
I'm a little short maybe I'm like a

294
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,140
barbarian dwarf not like they've made

295
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,260
plus two modifier for strength over time

296
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,240
I practice

297
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,220
I get used to CTI

298
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,140
I've had a host of different rfis that

299
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,640
I've been able to solicit and respond to

300
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,820
across a spectrum of different asks

301
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,100
I now increase my dexterity modifier as

302
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,680
I start to level up

303
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,500
if you're wondering where in the world

304
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,700
do I start

305
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,980
what skills do I have how do I even

306
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,360
measure that

307
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,160
well

308
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,839
according down in the keynote this field

309
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
has evolved quite a bit

310
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,620
so last year the folks over at Mandy and

311
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,380
put out the CTI core competencies

312
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,120
essentially in enumeration of all of

313
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,620
these different skills knowledge skills

314
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,040
and abilities

315
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,839
what it's done is it's provided us a way

316
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,700
to then start to understand okay what

317
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,560
are those key characteristics well think

318
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,899
of this kind of like

319
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,860
uh the miter attack of ttps for our

320
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,079
analytics skills

321
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,959
it's kind of a good allegory there

322
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
um I've recently expounded upon this so

323
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
you now have a spreadsheet which is

324
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,440
actually mapped to various rules some of

325
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,660
which we'll explore in just a little bit

326
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,640
if you use this as a starting point it

327
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,440
should help it should help you get a

328
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,320
sense of what I need to be what skills I

329
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,300
need to have what experiences I need in

330
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,140
play

331
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,240
be a strategic analyst

332
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,060
in operational support analyst

333
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,980
to be a more tactically supported

334
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,560
analyst right across the Spectrum there

335
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,300
if you're going through hopefully you're

336
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,820
asking questions how do I get there how

337
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,100
do I build those skills

338
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,200
what are the ways in which I can start

339
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,120
to demonstrate those competencies over

340
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,279
time

341
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,399
this ends up being a fundamental for us

342
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,200
to do Gap analysis

343
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,779
to understand what the Delta is and how

344
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,339
we can start to fill some of those gaps

345
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,899
as I was constructing this I was

346
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,940
thinking okay well what is a good way a

347
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,800
good parody that some individuals might

348
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,399
know so smart is an acronym here but I

349
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,320
usually see use quite a bit when we're

350
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,640
talking about performance reviews or

351
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,560
writing objectives uh that we're going

352
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,839
to try and complete as they relate to

353
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,420
mapping to okrs to organizations

354
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,760
however there's a lot of parallels that

355
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,560
we can draw from as we're thinking about

356
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
what those goals are and how we want to

357
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,100
achieve those once we've got ourselves

358
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,600
inventorian played we understand the

359
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,360
assessment we can then take that

360
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,339
information do a gap analysis

361
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,079
understanding

362
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,019
are my goals realistic

363
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,459
if your goal is I want to view the

364
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,079
system it's not completely out of the

365
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,420
question it's coming up with a formulas

366
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,980
plan that will get you there any timely

367
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,300
manner

368
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,279
you're coming in at the ground up you

369
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,720
might have

370
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,700
to develop additional experiences to

371
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,339
develop different skill sets

372
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,660
and we'll talk about that in just a

373
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,899
little bit too right so

374
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,399
when we look at filling those gaps they

375
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,440
come in one of two forms

376
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,260
do we have resources internal do we have

377
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,760
existing trainings do we have existing

378
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,100
roadmaps clearly you guys don't think HR

379
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,920
helps based on my survey earlier that's

380
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,980
okay that's not on me that's on you guys

381
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,740
um but we can start to understand okay

382
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,800
I've done my due diligence

383
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,980
I have looked internally and we do not

384
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,019
have the relevant assignments we do not

385
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,519
have the relevant trainings we don't

386
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,139
know how relevant a train uh rotational

387
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,760
assignments that would otherwise allow

388
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,019
me to start to fill some of these gaps

389
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:55,980
so

390
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,260
how do you feel them well that's when

391
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,600
you go external so identifying training

392
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,740
identifying different learning

393
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,180
opportunities that otherwise will get

394
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,160
you there sometimes this involves doing

395
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,139
coursework on your own working on kind

396
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,940
of projects on the side

397
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,500
if you make it known to organizations

398
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,959
especially leadership and I would say

399
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,760
cultures that have the Liberty they

400
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,740
usually allow you in flag some different

401
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,360
opportunities that would be helpful for

402
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,920
you whether it's side saddling or

403
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,959
mentoring all of these different

404
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,100
opportunities can kind of Avail

405
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,660
themselves

406
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,040
but keep in mind smart

407
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,480
now some of you probably came to this

408
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
talk because you thought I was going to

409
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,060
talk about how to get you promoted so

410
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,860
obligatory I have to at least talk about

411
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,420
career ladders

412
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,860
yeah

413
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,660
you have usually one of two tracks when

414
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,800
you're thinking about a career ladder

415
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
you either eventually go to the people

416
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,399
manager route or you go the individual

417
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
contributor out there are some

418
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,360
trade-offs though so as your goal

419
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,320
setting as you're thinking about

420
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,420
specific job role you want to get to

421
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,760
item for you to ask why

422
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,620
if your goal is to get promoted I'd ask

423
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,240
you why

424
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,820
is it status

425
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,279
is it going to help you in some way get

426
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,779
more organizational reach is it

427
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,880
compensation all of these funnel into

428
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,160
larger discussions with your leadership

429
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,300
team

430
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,579
you don't have to move up to maybe get

431
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,620
more compensation you don't have to move

432
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,440
up to get more responsibility however

433
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,399
once you've identified what you want

434
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,199
and you've had that discussion with your

435
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,180
leadership team they can start to spot

436
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,639
those opportunities for you

437
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,620
now cautionary Tale

438
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,420
if your goal is to run up the career

439
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,279
ladder as quick as possible you might

440
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,040
pay some trade-offs

441
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,660
you might lose out on experiential

442
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,920
opportunities

443
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,540
well if you wanted to go take a

444
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,339
rotational assignment to be an incident

445
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,320
responder chances are you can't do that

446
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,579
when you're at a senior manager level

447
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,800
oops

448
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,540
in government speak there was a certain

449
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,100
GS grade that you essentially were

450
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
stymied at least at my old organization

451
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,440
of which you were viewed as too valuable

452
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,899
of a resource on the team so they would

453
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,519
not let you leave it would be very hard

454
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,500
to make that justification but do

455
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,660
consider that as you're thinking about

456
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,320
what options exist instead maybe it's uh

457
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,000
try different things humble see what

458
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,740
resources otherwise are around

459
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,820
I want to show you guys a career map

460
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,980
that I created shortly action uh after

461
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,600
starting at mandian so I was with the

462
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,339
company for roughly six months this is

463
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,019
sanitized by the way all the stuff that

464
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,160
I'm going to show you is completely

465
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,819
sanitized

466
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,000
for myself where I was in my role I was

467
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,639
looking for Upward Mobility uh and I was

468
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,019
looking for organizational reach to help

469
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,820
influence strategic Direction

470
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,380
I was looking for more responsibilities

471
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,060
more accountability

472
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,759
I broke my roadmap down into two

473
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,899
different tracks so I'm on the

474
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,699
individual contributor side of the house

475
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,380
I presented my management with

476
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,519
essentially two listings which

477
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,440
predicated this roadmap

478
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,420
if I go this way

479
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,579
I can develop these skills if I go this

480
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,079
way I can develop these skills

481
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,720
ultimately I use that to justify a

482
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,459
conversation about training

483
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:03,959
what are the different experiences with

484
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,419
the different trainings that I need to

485
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,760
get to the point in which you want me to

486
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,579
and that I want to

487
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,980
I used three categories here you know

488
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,419
technical

489
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,280
soft skills and others something like

490
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,359
that

491
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,919
um now that I'm thinking about it if I

492
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,079
went to revisit this in 2023 I probably

493
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,880
would change this a little bit more

494
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,559
aligned to kind of what I laid out in

495
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,199
the core competencies where it would be

496
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,640
focused more on business Acumen

497
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,820
leadership technical skills

498
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,039
um soft skills is another one too that's

499
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,539
critically important or I guess we're

500
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,700
calling an emotional IQ these days

501
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,059
so understanding

502
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,280
what you want to do laying it on a

503
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,679
timeline like this really helps you have

504
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,179
that Career Development conversation

505
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,700
with your leadership team

506
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,919
we talked about it actually so me and my

507
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,059
boss at the time

508
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,980
um and he said yeah this you know looks

509
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,700
good

510
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,220
what I got from that was cool

511
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,780
so here's what things are going to cost

512
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,700
here's what's internal you still good

513
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,840
with it

514
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,220
yeah I guess you know we got some money

515
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,419
right now it's fine

516
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,520
awesome fantastic now I've got a

517
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,679
resource commit now I can start planning

518
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,419
what the timing actually looked like

519
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,400
one of the things I will caution you

520
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
about also from a career planning

521
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,600
perspective because we are all eager we

522
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,100
are all very ambitious here in this

523
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,880
field

524
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,059
for a self-selective crowd

525
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,780
don't put too much on your plate

526
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,340
I put the term up here shift happens

527
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,500
first off it's a fantastic book second

528
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,880
of all it's true

529
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,280
you don't know what the business is

530
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,480
going to do you don't know how it's

531
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,559
going to change you don't know if

532
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,600
leadership is going to change likewise

533
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,299
you don't necessarily have control over

534
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,280
things in your personal life

535
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,780
there are externalities there are things

536
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,840
that might create a creep up Elder Care

537
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,140
Family Planning Etc right those are all

538
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,419
decisions that you need to balance as

539
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,940
you were thinking about the roadmap

540
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,160
I was just with a former colleague last

541
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,500
night and he essentially was like look

542
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,360
guy I'm just coasting right now and

543
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,640
that's totally fine burnout sometimes

544
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,340
happens too so for him it's I'm pausing

545
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,780
my career development

546
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,320
because I just need the mental break

547
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,039
that's fine

548
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
we're thinking about actually tracking

549
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,299
your progress

550
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,760
I use a brag sheet anyone hear a bright

551
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,000
sheet before show of hands

552
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,799
got maybe 20 of you guys have heard of

553
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,620
bradsheet really fine not a problem the

554
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,760
brag sheet allows you to capture

555
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,640
your accolades showcase your fantastic

556
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
performance

557
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,820
I use Excel because it's the best tool

558
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,120
ever so why not use Excel and what I do

559
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,240
here is I lay out my field name

560
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,039
convention all of the different

561
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,360
attributes that I'm going for you can

562
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,679
also use this for performance review

563
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,960
because I have a terrible memory so come

564
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,220
end of year I'm not going to remember

565
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,780
all the things I did in the impact it

566
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,460
had

567
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,320
layout

568
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,120
all of the different attributes you want

569
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,940
over those fields then

570
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,980
did it date when you've done these

571
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,000
things and how they actually map

572
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,179
I've created a template for you if you

573
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,500
want to use it so if you go to

574
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,960
tinyurl.com

575
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,020
rag Dash sheet Dash template it'll take

576
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,520
you to an example

577
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,900
drag sheet

578
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,059
you're welcome

579
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,220
I will flip stop something

580
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,679
even though you can use the brag sheet

581
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,660
for career conversations and even career

582
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,919
planning

583
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,260
your career discussions with your

584
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,000
leadership team should not just be once

585
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,160
a year especially should not be the same

586
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
conversation with your performance

587
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,740
review

588
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,960
oftentimes neural managers commingled

589
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,720
too don't let that happen

590
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,000
career conversations should happen

591
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,820
routinely and recurringly

592
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,679
one of the best pieces of advice I

593
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,780
received from my first manager when I

594
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,059
joined uh government agency that I

595
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,500
worked for was

596
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,539
hey we're going to have these periodic

597
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,860
conversations

598
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,840
you at the junior level are going to be

599
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,160
in receive mode for a lot of these

600
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,860
beginning ones as you move up I expect

601
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,020
you to drive the conversation

602
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,380
the takeaway for me was

603
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,900
I am in charge of my own career he's

604
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,940
there to be a facilitator

605
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,860
help me understand what is a morale

606
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,140
possible and how we can achieve those

607
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,580
outcomes

608
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,000
which is really empowering but

609
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,799
I was fortunate in that I had a really

610
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,299
good manager who could be able to

611
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,000
facilitate that who could tell me that I

612
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,799
don't make that expectation for all

613
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,000
first-time managers out there

614
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,740
as we're thinking about justification as

615
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,380
we're thinking about growth

616
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,480
High your justification language for

617
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,100
whatever you're doing back to two things

618
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,620
one how is this going to make you better

619
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,620
at what you do today and two

620
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,539
how will this make you a more valuable

621
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,000
employee in the future

622
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,740
if you take a rotational assignment

623
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,960
you've got benefit of doing things like

624
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,280
understanding workflows of the

625
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,780
respective teams

626
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,340
that you support

627
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,220
it's on the Strategic side if you go

628
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,900
kind of do a partial rotation or spend

629
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
20 of your time in various different

630
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,440
meetings with your cyber risk colleagues

631
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,940
you'll start to understand their

632
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,980
workflows you'll start to understand the

633
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,480
frame of reference

634
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,240
and as a result you can write your

635
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,340
products you can start to capture data

636
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,200
sources and turn that into intelligence

637
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,460
they need

638
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,440
using a nomenclature that's familiar to

639
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,559
them

640
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,480
likewise

641
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,580
if you're looking to get

642
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,559
more effective at supporting your

643
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,179
operational colleagues to look at this

644
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,280
from the instant response perspective go

645
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,780
talk to them

646
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,760
this is a more natural marriage right

647
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,919
they usually understand the value of CTI

648
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,840
to help speed up their investigations to

649
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,700
minimize dwell time to identify

650
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,020
atmosphere activities and where to go

651
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,220
next

652
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,080
however

653
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,480
they might use some language that's

654
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,919
unfamiliar to you

655
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,480
so one of the things that I got to do

656
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,980
when I was at Landing was support some

657
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,539
of the investigations as an incident

658
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,120
responder I took a rotation that was

659
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,460
fantastic and super overwhelming thank

660
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,480
you for all of you who do incident

661
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,039
response

662
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,720
um one of the things that I came out

663
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
with is they use terms like High

664
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,860
Fidelity indicator of compromised well

665
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,080
what's that it's like a top tier of the

666
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,380
Pyramid of pain or like what

667
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,659
it was just a different nomenclature

668
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,520
that I wasn't used to hearing but I got

669
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,679
to learn as a result I was able to

670
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,000
provide them with more useful

671
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,980
information

672
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,840
this is one of those products that I

673
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,740
wrote

674
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,100
um shortly thereafter a nice hunt primer

675
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,799
in a way that they actually can consume

676
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,360
it so instead of using them as a

677
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,700
stakeholder directly I was able to

678
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,559
actually sit with them understand how

679
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,179
they were processing the information I

680
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,260
understood their workflows I understand

681
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,600
from the terminology

682
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,039
likewise

683
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,080
if you're interested in getting a little

684
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,299
deeper on vulnerability intelligence and

685
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,039
supporting the patch management teams or

686
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,659
the server support team desktop support

687
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,640
teams here you go

688
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,620
I've not following this out for you

689
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,299
so if you go to the extensible version

690
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,340
of the Cyber threat intelligence or

691
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,679
competencies

692
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,600
tinyurl.com slash

693
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,020
ETI Dash core Dash competencies you will

694
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,179
see this there are three different tabs

695
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:24,900
there

696
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,120
essentially job requirements ran out for

697
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,860
them

698
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,480
and

699
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,980
we're complaint is I put this tactical

700
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,539
side in here

701
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,580
I'll give you about 30 seconds to digest

702
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,140
this and this will give me a chance to

703
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,559
get some water

704
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,620
foreign

705
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,919
so one of the more important things to

706
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,960
do and again in this field we're all

707
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,500
very humble

708
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,419
oftentimes I find analysts especially

709
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,620
those who have more integrated

710
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,140
Tendencies will

711
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,080
not be great self-advocates and I again

712
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,600
question why you do amazing work every

713
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,440
day

714
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,419
why would you not be proud of oh well

715
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,620
you know I don't want to seem like I'm

716
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,720
bragging humble brags is totally fine

717
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,460
right

718
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,880
um same thing though find find a chat

719
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,980
find those individuals who can support

720
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,900
you whether that's in a mentorship

721
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,820
capacity not

722
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,440
um or just somebody on your team

723
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,380
localize what your Ambitions are

724
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,559
oh I want to grow in this area cool now

725
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,600
I know that now I can actually flag

726
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,159
opportunities I could flag information

727
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,620
that I think might be relevant to you

728
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,179
there's a deluge of information out

729
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,380
there and it's really hard to stay on

730
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,120
top of so

731
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,940
best we can or on each other rely on the

732
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,039
community

733
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,760
um again I've kind of created this

734
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,380
self-promotion cycle for you here as

735
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,059
kind of a cognitive model that might be

736
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,299
helpful

737
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,500
I'll tell you a little story about how

738
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,059
you can put this into practice

739
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,740
so some of you might be familiar with

740
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,600
some of these characters on the slide

741
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,539
if not this is from Zelda breath of the

742
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,720
Wild

743
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,260
link

744
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,159
awakens from a hundred year slumber

745
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,539
disoriented and dazed does not

746
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,860
remembered

747
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,600
who he is or what he's supposed to do

748
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,179
starts hearing voices in his head his

749
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,860
voices end up being from Princess Alvin

750
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,059
others

751
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,100
realizes really quickly that the kingdom

752
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,380
of hyrules and demise

753
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,120
it is up to him

754
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,700
and potentially others to help

755
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,740
reconstitute to save the Kingdom from

756
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,480
Calamine again

757
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,240
so along the way he plans out his goal

758
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,059
helps save the kingdom of Hyrule

759
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,039
help save the princess who's entrapped

760
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,539
by Colombian again

761
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,000
along the way he recruits friends

762
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,820
he recruits allies who help add

763
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,860
additional fortitude to weapons he

764
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,200
learns how to make elixirs different

765
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,840
food items again helps the fortification

766
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,279
he

767
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,580
gets guidance from sages he recruits and

768
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,159
also allies himself with various

769
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,020
Champions commanding the Divine beasts

770
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,260
to help him meet his ultimate goals

771
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,580
um to help him

772
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,460
position him for Success against that

773
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,260
final epic battle against Calamity

774
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,820
Gannon

775
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,720
so this is a well cheesy great example

776
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,820
of how you can apply this process

777
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,679
I have a very simplistic mind I like

778
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,539
checklists checklist helped me really

779
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,580
quickly I put checklists on my board I

780
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,620
have a checklist on my wall there is a

781
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,380
career planning checklist for you as I

782
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,320
start to wrap up the presentation

783
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,900
you can see starts with you starts with

784
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,520
creating a self-inventory it starts

785
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,799
identifying goals starts identifying

786
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,240
those skills and experiences that you

787
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,620
want to build to

788
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,299
if you have to go external when you're

789
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,679
doing the due diligence and you're still

790
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,720
searching in your Discovery process

791
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,460
identifying what the cost is going to be

792
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,679
not just monetary costs but cost in

793
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,179
which you are not going to be actually a

794
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,580
resource that could work

795
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,860
all along the way

796
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,440
identify those peers who can help you

797
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
who can help advocate for you whether

798
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,460
that's a mentor whether that's just

799
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,140
individuals on the team

800
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,480
peer mentors are a fabulous resource I

801
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,980
have so many peer mentors and I've

802
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,299
learned so much

803
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,000
from all of them some of which are in

804
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,279
the room here too right create timelines

805
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,740
help draft your own career roadmaps use

806
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,200
that as a way to start a conversation

807
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,960
one that you will frequently revisit

808
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,039
with your leadership team

809
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,700
and the text is not showing up fabulous

810
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,760
cool in the pdf version of this

811
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,100
presentation you will see I've given you

812
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,559
a slew of different references here as

813
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,120
denoted by these bullet points that you

814
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,559
can actually see but the text that you

815
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,539
can't

816
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,539
um the one I will call attention to is

817
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:55,980
actually visible

818
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,679
so Sierra uh just released this last

819
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,279
week on her start dot me page it is a

820
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,000
five-year planning essentially PDF book

821
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,159
very helpful as you kind of move forward

822
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,279
in your own progression

823
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,159
