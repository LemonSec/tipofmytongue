1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,380
thank you very much for the introduction

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,440
my name is Sierra stanchik and I'm super

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,660
excited to be here today talking to you

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,480
all about Bletchley Park and some of the

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,279
lessons that we can learn for modern

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,160
intelligence programs so a quick

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,800
question for the group how many of you

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,199
have heard of Bletchley Parker somewhat

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,000
familiar about the story

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,759
that's amazing I'm so glad to hear

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,200
um that there's a lot of people here

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,480
that know about it how many of you have

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
been there

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,020
awesome so a couple of you have been

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,219
there

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,620
um I'm sorry I will not do this place

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,160
Justice in 20 minutes so I definitely

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,379
encourage you to read up about Bletchley

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,120
Park I'll give you a little bit of

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,160
history today and some lessons and

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,620
insights that I gained from being there

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,780
and then you know anything that you can

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,760
read or look up and if you ever get the

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,399
opportunity to go definitely go it's an

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
amazing experience it's you know a place

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,420
for me where you know it's kind of like

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,400
Disney for me I stepped in and I was

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
just like this place is Magic can I move

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,240
in here

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,960
um they said no but still working on it

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,299
so a little bit about me uh my name is

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,400
Sierra like I said I'm a manager with

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,580
PWC threat intelligence and I also serve

35
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,979
as a strategic analyst for the group and

36
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,840
the uh the team's intelligence

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
operations lead it's super I I'm super

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,159
honored to be here today to be

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,540
representing this team they're

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,579
incredible wonderful people to work with

41
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,560
and I even have one of my colleagues

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,140
Allison Wyckoff here as well she's our

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,960
director's uh director for an America's

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,540
lead for our team and uh you know

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,000
definitely come say hi to us but uh

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,119
super honored to be here today

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,640
so how did I get to Bletchley Park it

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,520
was pretty simple I flew to London and

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,860
then went to London Houston Station and

50
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,259
took a train to Bletchley station and

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,640
just kind of walked across the street

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,979
but it's actually a much longer story

53
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,399
than that so prior to joining PWC I was

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,400
with the FBI for 12 years I started in

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,260
the directorate of intelligence and I

56
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,200
was working on strategic planning and

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,060
performance analysis for intelligence

58
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,580
programs and initiatives across the

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,940
Enterprise FBI intelligence program and

60
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,580
then fast forward a few years I become I

61
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,959
became the intelligence program

62
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,959
coordinator for FBI Philadelphia and got

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,819
to see how leadership worked and

64
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,680
development worked at a field office

65
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,680
level with Intel teams and so from there

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,680
I did all sorts of leadership trade

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,800
craft development requirements and

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,739
feedback all sorts of stuff with FBI

69
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,660
Philadelphia and really loved it and

70
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,760
just learned so much about how Intel

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,340
teams operate big and small across the

72
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,319
Enterprise with the intelligence

73
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,239
Community with the private sector so it

74
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,340
was a really great experience and then

75
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,800
in November of 2021 I had the

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,140
opportunity to join PWC threat

77
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,959
intelligence and it has just been an

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,019
amazing 15-month ride so far I've

79
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,540
learned so much for my team if you've

80
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,540
ever worked with us this team is like

81
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,280
truly stacked with some incredible

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,220
people so like I said super honored to

83
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,500
be here representing them

84
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,180
um so like I said join PWC and then

85
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,319
last June I met my team in London and we

86
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,239
did an all hands Meetup so we're a

87
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,040
global team so this was like the big

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,140
Meetup where we all got to get together

89
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,720
essentially for the first time as a team

90
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,180
and we were talking about all things

91
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,280
threat intelligence and our vision for

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,620
the future and then as soon as I left

93
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,319
that conference I was super excited

94
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,659
steeped in all things intelligence and

95
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,640
really energized and then I went to

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,519
Bletchley Park and was like wow it's all

97
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,680
kind of coming together all of my

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,140
experiences and intelligence since 2009

99
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,599
I had all of these parallels and lessons

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,159
and this is what I really want to share

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,959
with you today

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,780
so coming to Bletchley Park this is

103
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,000
where you'll arrive this is the mansion

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,379
this is where a lot of cool things

105
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,939
happened it wasn't where everything

106
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,238
happened but this is um just one of the

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,339
really cool things to come to Bletchley

108
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,500
Park and get a sense of its history and

109
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,900
everything that went on

110
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,940
um and so some of the lessons that we'll

111
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,740
be talking about today I'll be kind of

112
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,780
going through a little bit of background

113
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,880
of Bletchley Park and then how it

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,160
applies to modern day intelligence

115
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,199
programs

116
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,800
so Bletchley Park is located about 42

117
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,100
miles outside of London and it stood up

118
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,100
in September 1939

119
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,639
um

120
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,340
basically to form the core operation of

121
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,080
Britain's government code and Cypher

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,419
school and so it was appalachee Park

123
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,280
where a lot of things were happening

124
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
like the intelligence cycle where

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
collection was brought in from y

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,000
stations located throughout

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,919
um the UK as well as collective

128
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,419
collection from diplomatic

129
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,880
establishments and whatnot but it was

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,860
all processed here in Bletchley Park

131
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,400
Until 1946 after the end of World War II

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,979
and so when we just to kind of give you

133
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,139
an appreciation of what they were

134
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,740
dealing with uh the level of radio

135
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,380
communications that were being processed

136
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,080
and integrated and integrated as part of

137
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,660
military operations during World War II

138
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,940
was something that you know had not been

139
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,340
seen before prior there was a little bit

140
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,620
in World War one but the level that it

141
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,900
was integrated especially by Germany

142
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,479
during World War II brought a whole new

143
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,000
era of signals intelligence into the

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,539
game and so Bletchley Park had a huge

145
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,820
challenge of ahead of itself of trying

146
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,560
to make sense of all these radio

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,419
communications and like I said other

148
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,880
collection like diplomatic chatter and

149
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,960
whatnot

150
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,600
so they had to go through a lot of

151
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,699
information and figure out a process for

152
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,100
handling it and so some of these if

153
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,720
you're familiar with the history some of

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,000
these were worse code messages that were

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
encoded with Enigma machines that they

156
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,160
would have to break daily codes decrypt

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,039
the messages translate the messages and

158
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,139
then integrate them as part of the

159
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,780
intelligence cycle process and then you

160
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,940
had longer format messages that were

161
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,039
teletype Transmissions that were

162
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,800
encrypted but by Loren's machines and so

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
these are just a couple of examples

164
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,759
there's plenty of others a lot of

165
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,400
research of just the complexity of the

166
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
collection coming in even the complexity

167
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,560
of getting the intercepts the intercepts

168
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,900
themselves it was really an impressive

169
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,419
effort and so Bletchley Park was pulling

170
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,180
all of this in making sense of it and

171
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,340
then giving key high value intelligence

172
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,000
known as Ultra intelligence two key

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,220
stakeholders one of it one of which was

174
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,960
Winston Churchill he was a huge

175
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,900
proponent of this program and a huge

176
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,239
consumer of ultra intelligence

177
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,160
so take a moment to read this quote by

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
Robert Hannigan he was reflecting on

179
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,380
Bletchley Park and what it would

180
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,139
eventually turn into which is the UK's

181
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,060
government Communications Headquarters

182
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,319
or gchq

183
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,220
foreign

184
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,580
so he's looking at this situation he's

185
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,259
looking at you know reflecting on

186
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,020
Bletchley Park and what it means now

187
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,660
does this look familiar to anybody

188
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,759
raise your hand if your organization is

189
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
having similar challenges

190
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,060
pretty much everyone

191
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,160
um at the core of every intelligence

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,699
program is trying to understand how best

193
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,340
to sift through an ever-expanding world

194
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,819
of information make sense of it turn it

195
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,500
turn it into something meaningful

196
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,780
especially when it's scattered it's

197
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,720
encrypted it's incomplete it's confusing

198
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,880
and then turning it into something

199
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,000
useful to Consumers but here's the

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
kicker in a timely manner when they need

201
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,880
it so this quote really resonated with

202
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,539
me it kind of kicked off the book by Dr

203
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,880
David Kenyon he's Bletchley Parks

204
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,400
research historian he wrote a fantastic

205
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,220
book about D-Day and Bletchley Park's

206
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,460
role um in D-Day so again if you're

207
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,860
interested definitely check that book

208
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,500
out it's a fascinating story and I

209
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,779
regret I don't have enough time to share

210
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,120
all of that but um it's amazing

211
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,640
so how did Bletchley Park do what they

212
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,099
did at a high level this should be

213
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,440
somewhat familiar so they would uh

214
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,240
basically go and start with Direction

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,540
finding figuratively and literally they

216
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,980
would look to see where they could

217
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,860
collect information and how and like I

218
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,839
said a lot of it was intercepts there

219
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,700
was other information but Direction

220
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,920
finding was key and then they would

221
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,260
collect the information and then put

222
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,880
specific intercepts through a

223
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,160
registration process which is where they

224
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,560
essentially logged and triaged the

225
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,660
information and then the information

226
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,940
that was sent to Bletchley Park went

227
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,800
through traffic analysis which was

228
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,260
essentially metadata analysis and then

229
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,899
code breaking and decryption so even

230
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,760
when they collected it and they

231
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,040
decrypted it they then then had to

232
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,019
figure out what it meant so they had to

233
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,019
then translate the information index it

234
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,940
which I'll talk a little bit about later

235
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,180
and then actually analyze information in

236
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,980
the traditional intelligence analysis

237
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,200
sense that we think think of and then

238
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,779
produce reports or any kind of mechanism

239
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,700
that was appropriate to get it to the

240
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,100
right person through dissemination and

241
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,320
here's you know a plot twist they would

242
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,120
have to encrypt the information again

243
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,060
before sending it out so it was this you

244
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,060
know pervasive intelligence cycle at

245
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,740
Bletchley Park to handle all this

246
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,380
information with the states being very

247
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,000
very high

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,279
but I want to point out one thing and

249
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,220
kind of talk about this more broadly

250
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,480
instead of thinking about what happened

251
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,519
at Bletchley Park as an intelligence

252
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,519
cycle I suggest we think about it as an

253
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,100
intelligence system and something that

254
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,560
has interdependent and interconnected

255
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,019
components throughout where it's not

256
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,959
sequential and it's not necessarily

257
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
cyclical in the sense of it's just going

258
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,940
to continue on and on but it's more of

259
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,459
like a living breathing system with a

260
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,700
heart with a network with a memory with

261
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,860
constant communication and constant

262
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,800
collaboration being a vital part of

263
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,740
making this system work

264
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,440
and so if we distill it back down to the

265
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,420
traditional intelligence stages that

266
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,240
we're used to this cycle looks a lot or

267
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,800
this system looks a lot like the

268
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,300
intelligence cycle that we know with

269
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,240
Direction collection processing analysis

270
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,640
and dissemination

271
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,940
so when we're starting with Direction

272
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,420
we're talking about uh people having a

273
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,640
common Mission and common set of values

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,500
and that's something that Bletchley Park

275
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,440
really really had they had a strong

276
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
mission to be there and they were Bound

277
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,820
by this common set of values so that's

278
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,920
just one of the key pieces that I wanted

279
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,380
to point out and kind of put it back to

280
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,959
the group as a question you know what do

281
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,420
the values look like on your team in

282
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,579
your intelligence program what is

283
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,279
binding your team together what are the

284
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,200
values and what is the mission that is

285
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,600
turning your group of colleagues into a

286
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,660
cohesive team at Bletchley Park they had

287
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,000
a lot at stake they had a lot of

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,100
challenges but they had a lot of heart

289
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,200
and that powered a lot of their

290
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,899
motivation and um you know sense to the

291
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:49,740
mission

292
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,720
they also had priorities and

293
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,959
requirements that they shared

294
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,100
extensively with everyone that they

295
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,440
worked with and so it wasn't a matter of

296
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,720
having a list of requirements or a

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,240
quarterly update on priorities they were

298
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,519
talking to each other in different roles

299
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,279
to make sure that they knew what each

300
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,079
other cared about and what information

301
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
would come across their desk that other

302
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,940
people needed to know because it wasn't

303
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,040
as simple as seeing something cool on

304
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,260
Twitter and then slacking it to a

305
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,019
colleague and then putting it into a

306
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,760
knowledge base and then searching it

307
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,640
later like none of that existed so this

308
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,579
really depended on people even at an

309
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,860
individual contributor level really

310
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,959
actioning priorities and requirements

311
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,000
and sharing them pervasively and

312
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,519
thinking about others and having this

313
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,820
Mission and values and requirements all

314
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,100
together they had a lot of care for each

315
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,260
other and recognition that they were

316
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,420
dependent on each other to be successful

317
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,300
and so you had this communal nature

318
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,279
within these teams at Bletchley Park

319
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,040
where if they weren't physically located

320
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
near each other they went out of their

321
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,440
way to connect physically to you know

322
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,380
really have those conversations even if

323
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,320
it meant Crossing long distances and so

324
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,079
as an example we had collectors in the Y

325
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,800
stations who would bring in analysts and

326
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,380
code Breakers from Bletchley Park and

327
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,180
remember the Y stations were located

328
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,820
throughout the United Kingdom and they

329
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,980
would have these meetups and talk about

330
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,139
priorities and requirements and

331
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,480
different lines of intercepts and they

332
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,940
would refine their prioritization based

333
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,160
on that collaboration and those

334
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,220
discussions and without that really

335
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,899
Bletchley Park wouldn't have been able

336
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,839
to prioritize and process collection the

337
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,600
way that they needed to as you can

338
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,360
imagine the 1940s they were collecting a

339
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,399
lot of information but there was a lot

340
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,200
of backlog and they had to make

341
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,060
decisions about what they were going to

342
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,980
put through this system and what they

343
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,240
were going to leave on The Cutting Room

344
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,820
floor of the Y stations so it's just

345
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,459
fascinating to think about and have an

346
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,200
appreciation for how much they

347
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,079
collaborated and shared these um these

348
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,940
priorities and conversations so

349
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,920
frequently and made it a part of their

350
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,420
daily work

351
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,000
they also you know talking about a lot

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,980
of collection they also powered through

353
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,320
information overload by having this

354
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,959
intelligence Factory mindset and they

355
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,060
basically knew that even with all of the

356
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,700
collection coming in if one person

357
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,760
didn't do their job and stalled the

358
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,279
system it meant that the system would

359
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,680
eventually break down so they knew that

360
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,260
they had to keep information moving they

361
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,639
need to do their do their job

362
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,200
effectively because other people

363
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,540
depended on them and they really needed

364
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,300
to power through and make tough calls

365
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,920
and tough decisions when they were

366
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,779
getting through this information

367
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,399
overload

368
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,220
so one of the questions that I have for

369
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,440
you all if you within your organization

370
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,240
how often are you talking about

371
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,060
priorities and requirements and as an

372
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,399
analyst are you thinking about those and

373
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,680
refining them to a level where you're

374
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,360
having conversations with your

375
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
colleagues about what's important to

376
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,040
their work and how that fits in with the

377
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,220
broader priorities of your organization

378
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,380
and uh one thing that I found really

379
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,019
interesting about all of this was that

380
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,120
you would have so many different roles

381
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
and we'll kind of talk about the

382
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,420
different roles at Bletchley Park but

383
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,339
they were still communicating with each

384
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,139
other even if they didn't know exactly

385
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,899
what each other did and so for me I

386
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,699
think about that and I think about Intel

387
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,620
teams and think you know as individual

388
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,079
researchers and analysts are you having

389
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,720
conversations with a diverse set of

390
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,240
co-workers on your team or are you kind

391
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,220
of clinging to people where you're you

392
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,600
know them well or you know their

393
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,880
researcher roles well and I would just

394
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
challenge that you really expand your

395
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,980
scope of who you're reaching out to on

396
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,680
your teams and really learn about what

397
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,899
other people are doing on your team even

398
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,240
if you don't really know much about the

399
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,459
role or you don't see the connections

400
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,680
because you'll find that when you're

401
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,380
really reaching out to your team and

402
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,320
having that diverse perspective in

403
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,940
conversations you'll see how

404
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,459
interconnected and interdependent your

405
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,060
teams are

406
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,920
and so when we move on the collection I

407
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,779
know I talked a little bit a little bit

408
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,940
about collection what was collected so

409
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm going to talk about who did um who

410
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,920
was influencing and using the collection

411
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,220
at Bletchley Park so one thing that I

412
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,500
think uh really stood out to me as part

413
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,420
of my research and in the visits was

414
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,459
just the presence of women in Bletchley

415
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,339
Park at its highest Staffing levels more

416
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,800
than half of um the staff at Bletchley

417
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,019
Park was made up of women and this was

418
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,699
both in the service and civilian

419
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,100
capacity so it just really neat to see

420
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
the types of roles that they were in and

421
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,079
how much they really powered Bletchley

422
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,480
Park and we'll talk a little bit about a

423
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
couple other roles that a lot of them

424
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,899
held but one of them

425
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,660
um one of the groups was the women's

426
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,500
Royal Naval service or wrens they were

427
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,959
um staffed in a lot of the Y stations

428
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,880
throughout the United Kingdom the

429
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,099
kingdom doing the collection but they

430
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,439
were also riding these motorcycles and

431
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,540
bicycles and they were dispatch Riders

432
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,160
sharing intercepts with different

433
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,559
locations including Bletchley Park

434
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,299
throughout the war so they were

435
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,520
physically taking the intercepts and

436
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,559
driving them to where they needed to go

437
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,839
so they were really hardcore they were

438
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,640
really awesome and it's just a

439
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,860
fascinating thing to see especially at

440
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,260
Bletchley Park and if you've ever driven

441
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,240
around the UK and you can imagine like

442
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,820
the 1940s and the rain and the mud and

443
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,280
the war and intercepts it's just very

444
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,460
very humbling

445
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,840
so a few other roles I apologize for the

446
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,940
angle of this photo there was a group of

447
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,740
school children that I was trying to

448
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,660
maneuver around

449
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,480
um but these are some of the roles that

450
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,260
Bletchley Park if it's hard to see but

451
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,480
um just take a look there's like a bunch

452
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,039
of different roles that you're like huh

453
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
I wonder what that is

454
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,179
um and I'm just gonna go ahead and get

455
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,400
this like out of the way I know there's

456
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,200
a role on there where you're like I

457
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,720
don't know what that is or what it had

458
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,640
to do with the war

459
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,780
um does anyone see what I see

460
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,510
meteorologist right

461
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,960
[Laughter]

462
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,100
it was the other one

463
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,080
um yeah definitely meteorologist that

464
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,539
was the the one that was a little weird

465
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,820
um so what did meteorologist I by the

466
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,160
way I looked it up so you don't have to

467
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,440
um meteorologists were actually reading

468
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,440
the intercepts uh about enemy forecasts

469
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
which were coming through a lot on

470
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,120
certain lines and these were actually

471
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,039
key to a lot of the code breaking

472
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,700
activities because the forecasts were in

473
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,000
some senses formulaic and repetitive so

474
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,919
it was a good way to start building

475
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,780
cribs and start thinking about different

476
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,039
ways to break the daily code so

477
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,720
meteorologists were definitely key with

478
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,340
helping out with that but also really

479
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,380
reading the intercepts and understanding

480
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,580
enemy

481
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,799
um understanding weather conditions and

482
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,840
enemy territories

483
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
but at the end of the the day every role

484
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,100
had a piece of the puzzle and so like I

485
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,020
said earlier there was trust that people

486
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,299
would get the job done because others

487
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,860
were depending on them and you can see

488
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,160
how diverse all of the roles were and

489
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,020
what kind of help that they needed and

490
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,940
roles that they needed as part of this

491
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,980
so as they were building out their

492
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,200
collection building out the roles

493
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,380
building out the processes uh one thing

494
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,480
that I really appreciated was their

495
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,539
ability to expand the organization

496
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,880
physically by building more huts and

497
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,940
warehouses but also maintaining a fluid

498
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,940
structure of organization and being able

499
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,100
to recalibrate the organization and

500
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,380
co-locate related groups and

501
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,720
interdependent groups without it being

502
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,440
like a huge bureaucratic thing they

503
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,480
really streamlined it so that it would

504
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,720
be a functional growing organization and

505
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,360
this is in contrast to when it was like

506
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,559
really first firing up in 1939 and 1940

507
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,720
it was more of an incubator like

508
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,299
construct where they were experimenting

509
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,919
and they were trying different things

510
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,799
and then over you know a period of a

511
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,480
couple of years they really had to

512
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,760
transform it into this production-like

513
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,580
facility also with like production and

514
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,559
like facility conditions if you can

515
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,020
imagine in the 1940s but they

516
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,059
essentially went from you know less than

517
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,660
100 people to 9 000 in a very short

518
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,240
period of time and one of the biggest

519
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,299
takeaways for me as an intelligence you

520
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,900
know program nerd is wow like they were

521
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,640
able to do this they were able to give

522
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,440
their analysts and their their different

523
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,960
job roles options

524
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,720
um without having to like you know just

525
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,400
throw they didn't have time to throw

526
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,080
away the whole Playbook and start over

527
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,840
and do all of these crazy reorgs they

528
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
kind of adjusted as they went and

529
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
streamline organizations as they went

530
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,960
along so I would definitely challenge

531
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,720
you if your organization has an insult

532
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,059
program think about that Bletchley Park

533
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,860
could do it within a couple of years and

534
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,559
9 000 people please stop the dreaded

535
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,860
reorg and uh please think about having a

536
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,740
more fluid and dynamic

537
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,380
um organizational structure for your

538
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,080
teams so that they can you know

539
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,120
recalibrate their skills on their own

540
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
and move and migrate as needed and as

541
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,100
the missions needed

542
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,919
um so that was one of the biggest

543
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,120
takeaways for me

544
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,419
for me but essentially with this growth

545
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,760
they knew that the encryption

546
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,059
um was going to evolve and so these

547
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,400
daily code changes and the methods with

548
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,500
the Enigma machines and other machines

549
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,140
they were preparing for a future State

550
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,419
and that was so important to their

551
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,460
success they saw you know they

552
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,980
envisioned what was coming down the

553
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,960
years and what they would need to do and

554
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
they started building toward it and they

555
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
knew that the intercepts were going to

556
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,720
increase in volume and they started

557
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
building toward that and so while they

558
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,380
were doing

559
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,059
um while they were evolving their

560
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,280
structure but having this fluid dynamic

561
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,100
they were still pushing those same you

562
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,740
know general concepts of trust you know

563
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,419
independent Independence and

564
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,700
accountability but individual autonomy

565
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,520
and making sure that you as an analyst

566
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,640
or researcher indexer librarian whatever

567
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,039
role that you had in Bletchley Park you

568
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,900
may not have been able to see the bigger

569
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,120
picture but you knew that people

570
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,460
depended on you and you depended on on

571
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,799
other people as well and so that just

572
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,720
kept the system moving and kept the

573
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,940
system going especially during really

574
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,720
difficult times

575
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,400
so if we get to processing I know when

576
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,980
we talk about the intelligence cycle the

577
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,260
processing phase can really be confusing

578
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,960
for people and so I think in this

579
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,820
context the best way to talk about

580
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,760
processing is turning what was collected

581
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,240
into something that's manageable for the

582
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,179
organization to figure out how best to

583
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,820
handle it and to increase the potential

584
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,460
that the information will be viewed by

585
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,980
the right people at the right time and

586
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,080
so the way that Bletchley Park did this

587
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,659
was through Knowledge Management it was

588
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,000
such a critical component of Bletchley

589
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,059
Park and if you can imagine again no

590
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,580
computers here in fact the first

591
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,559
electronic computer was developed at

592
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,200
Bletchley Park named Colossus but it

593
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,760
wasn't you know something that they

594
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,919
could necessarily like Google search

595
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,919
different terms and then put analysis

596
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,440
together and assessments together based

597
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,299
on what they collected like none of that

598
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,140
was available and so they yeah

599
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,000
they use these guys

600
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,679
index cards millions of them and index

601
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,419
cards mean a lot of things to a lot of

602
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,580
people I know like flash cards for

603
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,280
students and for human collectors it's

604
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,220
you know a definite uh go-to for them

605
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,059
but these index cards formed the indices

606
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,940
of Bletchley Park and so any information

607
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,000
that was coming through when it was

608
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,020
collected prioritized

609
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,200
decrypted translated and then analyzed

610
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,780
it was also indexed and that was a

611
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,539
painstaking clerical process where you

612
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,539
would have Librarians and indexers

613
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,100
basically sorting through all of these

614
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,740
data points putting them on index cards

615
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,020
color coding them grouping them together

616
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,600
and then making them available through

617
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,900
querying so that analysts or other roles

618
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,140
could come to the Librarians and say do

619
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,700
you have more information about this

620
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,559
piece of enemy equipment or do you have

621
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,480
more information about this call sign

622
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,659
that hinged on Librarians and indexers

623
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,940
and having a knowledge base that was

624
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,520
searchable and that was Dynamic for

625
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,940
Bletchley Park Super impressive they had

626
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,580
all sorts of mechanics behind it to make

627
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,860
it work and make it fast but they would

628
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,299
essentially be able to recall

629
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,080
information from days ago or years ago

630
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,059
especially if it was Inc incomplete or

631
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,700
not necessarily relevant they had this

632
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,559
process and they maintained this

633
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,080
knowledge base to help with their

634
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,940
analysis and help with their operations

635
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,580
moving forward and so this really

636
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,440
developed the memory and neural network

637
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,900
of Bletchley Park and just a very

638
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,240
fascinating fascinating case study in

639
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,279
Knowledge Management and just how much

640
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,900
collection they were coming that was

641
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,059
coming into Blatchley Park and what they

642
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,159
were able to do with it um was super

643
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,860
impressive so I would I would definitely

644
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,260
challenge this audience it's like what

645
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,240
does that neural network look like for

646
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,400
your organization do you have

647
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,919
institutional and individual expertise

648
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,799
that you're collating together probably

649
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,320
virtually with a collaboration tool like

650
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,419
we have such an incredible opportunity

651
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,340
to use those

652
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,020
um but what does that look like as part

653
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,480
of your organization is it something

654
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,360
that is prioritized and is valued in

655
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
your organization and what are your

656
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,919
analysts and other roles doing to

657
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
contribute to that knowledge base

658
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,940
regularly and keep it alive and keep it

659
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,200
relevant and keep it in use for a future

660
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,400
iterations of your organization

661
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,260
so moving on to analysis

662
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,080
they were basically able to query the

663
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,419
neural network the knowledge base and

664
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,520
facilitate analytic processes by

665
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,900
bringing different groups of people

666
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,460
together whether they were different

667
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,419
Services military branches agencies even

668
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,120
countries they were able to bring these

669
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,279
people together and conduct critical

670
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,919
thinking and collaboration using this

671
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,500
neural network and using this emphasis

672
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,840
of trust and diversity in keeping things

673
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,659
moving in the intelligence system and in

674
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,700
some cases they really broke down

675
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,760
bureaucratic silos one example of this

676
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,820
was Hut 3 was a group of intelligence

677
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,220
analysts they basically owned the

678
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,760
analytic process and they were basically

679
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,700
entitled and empowered to be the

680
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,700
stewards of high value intelligence so

681
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,980
even if something came in through one

682
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,799
interception line or another

683
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,200
um you know piece of collection they

684
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,179
could make decisions on who this was

685
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,360
disseminated to even if it wasn't

686
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,059
apparently if the relevance wasn't

687
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,760
Apparent at face value so they were

688
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,100
entrusted with owning the process and no

689
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,799
knowing who would benefit and having the

690
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,900
flexibility to make sure that they got

691
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,380
that information and as you can imagine

692
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,919
um

693
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,659
there are groups that were product

694
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,240
protective over certain sources of

695
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,400
collection and they wanted to dictate

696
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,740
this process and Hut three had to fight

697
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,320
to have this broad Authority

698
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,900
um and to be trusted with making these

699
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,720
dissemination uh decisions and they were

700
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,240
able to do this and do it well and it

701
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,520
definitely served Bletchley Park in the

702
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,340
Allied Force as well for giving them

703
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,820
that type of authority so definitely a

704
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,700
lesson in having trust in your analysts

705
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,279
and having trust that they will be

706
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,799
responsible with collection and Analysis

707
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,480
and that they will make the right

708
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,059
decisions about dissemination so

709
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,279
definitely encourage with your

710
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,620
intelligence programs to trust the

711
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,860
analysts trust the analytic process and

712
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,080
learn from them and really engage them

713
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,779
in decision making so that information

714
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,120
is going to the right people regardless

715
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,320
of where it came from

716
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,419
and so the final stage is dissemination

717
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,919
I know that we talk a lot about

718
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,779
dissemination today in the earlier

719
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,000
conversations

720
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,620
um what I really took away from

721
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,080
Bletchley Park was that dissemination

722
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,720
and feedback were pervasive throughout

723
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,059
Bletchley Park and its partner agencies

724
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,580
and the countries that they worked with

725
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,799
it was just a constant stream of

726
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,440
information where they were relaying you

727
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,419
know short for form intelligence

728
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,940
notifications or longer form

729
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,520
intelligence assessments to various

730
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,799
stakeholders they knew Their audience

731
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,779
but they were constantly refining

732
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,179
priorities and feedback based on these

733
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,539
conversations and in some cases this

734
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,760
feedback and these conversations were so

735
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,440
critical that they were channeling

736
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,600
direct lines of communications to

737
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,840
specific teams in Bletchley Park to

738
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,399
their um

739
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,860
their counterparts in other countries

740
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,159
and other intelligence agencies so 1940s

741
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,440
this was like you know a big deal having

742
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,440
this level of communication and one of

743
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,600
the interesting points is they knew

744
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,980
Their audience they knew their

745
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,679
stakeholders Winston Churchill like I

746
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,840
said was a huge consumer of ultra

747
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,659
intelligence he wanted uh Ultra

748
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,659
intelligence with him every morning when

749
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,419
he was waking up he wanted to read uh

750
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,159
some of the intercepts he wanted to read

751
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,100
the reporting and so you know that they

752
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,380
took that opportunity to send him some

753
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,299
of the juicier intercepts that were

754
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,179
coming through but like I said

755
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,779
um the D-Day Story by Dr David Kenyon

756
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,820
there's a really really powerful story

757
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,640
about how Bletchley Park and collection

758
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,159
analysis and dissemination influenced

759
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,539
that

760
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,460
um so definitely encourage that story

761
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,779
so when we're talking about an

762
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,360
intelligence system you know how can we

763
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,000
really start looking at our program like

764
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,760
a system itself unless like a cycle and

765
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,380
one way is when you're looking at a

766
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,539
system you're monitoring the vital signs

767
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:06,120
and so these are some questions that you

768
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,140
can ask if your program is functioning

769
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,460
healthily and if your intelligence

770
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,279
program is operating like a system and

771
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,279
that's mainly you know is it are you

772
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,740
seeing your analysts actively engaged in

773
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,840
your mission are your team members

774
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,940
invested in the success of their group

775
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,760
but also in each other's success are

776
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,799
they cheering each other on are they

777
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,500
showing up are they alerting management

778
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,380
and Leadership when the vital signs are

779
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,080
a little off when something feels off in

780
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,760
the group

781
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,340
um each individual on your team has a

782
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,260
unique perspective that they might be

783
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,380
able to find something early on when

784
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,360
something is amiss in your intelligence

785
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,460
system that maybe you may not have

786
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,520
picked up on right away

787
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,100
and here are a few more questions that

788
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,080
you can ask I know we've talked a lot

789
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,600
about burnout in the industry you know

790
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,640
is your team looking at each other and

791
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,700
making sure that your uh your employees

792
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,559
know about burnout and that they're not

793
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,260
experiencing it or if they are how the

794
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,720
group can rally behind them

795
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,059
um another big thing is how is your

796
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,880
organization defining success and impact

797
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,279
and how at an individual level are you

798
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,720
tracking that as well if you've heard

799
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,659
from uh John's discussion earlier ways

800
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,580
that you can track that

801
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,440
um throughout the year and not just

802
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,240
during you know annual performance

803
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,700
season but these are all things that you

804
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,679
can do to track the vitals of your

805
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,620
intelligence uh system and intelligence

806
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,899
program

807
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,500
so covered a lot of ground today I hope

808
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,440
that uh these key lessons from and just

809
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,659
you know vignettes from Bletchley Park

810
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,940
offer a little bit of insight into

811
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,279
breaking the Enigma of your intelligence

812
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,860
program looking at it more as a system

813
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,220
rather than a cycle talking about shared

814
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,480
values and priorities and having trust

815
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,779
talking about using diverse skill sets

816
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,240
building diverse roles and having a

817
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,880
fluid structure and not relying on

818
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,299
reworks and huge disruptions building

819
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,159
out that neural network and the

820
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,500
knowledge base of your team what does

821
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,480
that look like how can you use

822
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,360
technology to empower it and is all of

823
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,419
your team engaged in that knowledge base

824
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,820
and then analysis and dissemination

825
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,860
empowering your analysts giving them

826
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,019
options talking about feedback and

827
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,659
recalibration and then monitoring the

828
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,779
vital signs not just as a manager but as

829
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,360
any kind of team member on uh within the

830
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,700
program keeping a pulse check on the

831
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,860
health of your program and making sure

832
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,899
that if something's amiss that you're

833
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,659
promoting a culture of openness and that

834
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,720
you're enabling anyone within your team

835
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,360
