1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,700
this talk kind of came out of a desire

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,760
for a little bit more

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,780
transparency into the education around

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,420
malware analysis there are so many

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,820
different pieces of content around how

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,039
to perform malware analysis there are so

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,720
many different articles with screenshots

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,260
of ghidra Hydra binary ninja whatever

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,840
tool that you decide to use and a lot of

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,279
those are really painful to look at and

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,660
like somebody that's coming up new in

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,579
the field kind of goes man how do you do

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,620
this why do you look at Assembly

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,180
Language all day was there childhood

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,940
trauma involved like at what point did

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,680
you decide that you were going to like

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,399
be a masochist for a living and so

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,079
this is kind of what I want to get into

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,879
is kind of taking that assumed knowledge

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,379
of well yeah we know why people do

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,820
malware analysis Let's Make That

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,340
explicit like let's actually talk

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,680
through it like let's talk about how

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,660
we're going to use malware analysis as a

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,260
data source

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,699
so my name is Tony I'm a senior malware

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,180
analyst of Red Canary I previously you

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,860
know spent a lot of time doing system

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,380
admin work desktop admin work and taught

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,479
on the side as an adjunct instructor

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,060
my slide template said I had to have a

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,460
fun fact at the bottom so I have a

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,100
retired racer that's our pet at home a

35
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,320
little Greyhound named Stark and if you

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,700
learn nothing else from the next 30

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,600
minutes

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,280
Greyhounds are always looking for a good

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,720
home there's only one state that does

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,240
racing anymore now and there's still a

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,500
lot that need to have good homes

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,299
and the first big thing the agenda the

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,560
you know what we're going to talk about

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,200
I want to talk through why we analyze

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,439
malware kind of that fundamental Point

46
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,900
uh you know we we're doing something we

47
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,820
have to have a goal otherwise we're just

48
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,220
playing in a sandbox right we're not

49
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,960
just handling snakes because we like

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,479
snakes some people do that's fine but

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,340
you know if you want to get paid to play

52
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,320
with the snakes here's why we're doing

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,220
it

54
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm going to talk a little bit about how

55
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,880
malware analysis helps a larger

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,740
intelligence team I'm going to talk

57
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,780
about how you know the stuff that you

58
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,818
get out of malware analysis how you can

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,580
incorporate that to you know make your

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,780
intelligence team a little bit better

61
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,700
make your detection process a little bit

62
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,140
better maybe get some better detection

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,140
outcomes and these are these examples

64
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,360
that I'm going to talk about are real

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
life examples that actually came from

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,860
our organization this is something that

67
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,080
is not contrived it's not something that

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,580
made up and say you know what this would

69
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,500
be a good idea this is real stuff

70
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,020
and the first big thing is talking to

71
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,120
why do we do malware analysis and it

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,680
really kind of comes down to three

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
different fundamental things we have

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,300
indicators identity of malware and

75
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,980
malware capabilities

76
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,900
for indicators this can be you know

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,819
whatever you traditionally think

78
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,420
hashes you know maybe an import Hash a

79
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,940
IP address domain different things like

80
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,840
that

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,879
but it can also be anything on that you

82
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,400
know pyramid of pain thanks Joe

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,640
um where like it can be tdps it can be

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,099
all the different you know things all

85
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,500
along that pyramid it's not necessarily

86
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,060
one Atomic thing

87
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,159
and with indicators like this kind of

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,480
you know gets a little bit weird when

89
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,819
you talk to people because somebody goes

90
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,500
well why do I need malware analysis

91
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,800
capabilities I pay for a thread feed

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,659
you got me but you know

93
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,700
DirecTV comes from somewhere

94
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,440
somebody up the line did malware

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,900
analysis you know all the indicators

96
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,900
that show up on abuse.ch they came from

97
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,120
somewhere they got malware analysis you

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,980
know the spinach that goes into your

99
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,780
salad doesn't magically show up in the

100
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,280
salad it has to be harvested from

101
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,260
somewhere this is the same sort of thing

102
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,840
it's like a kind of joke calling it you

103
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,420
know Farm to Table indicators

104
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,400
um so it's that's essentially what we've

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,739
got now for identity

106
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,959
identity can be a bunch of different

107
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:58,920
things

108
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,360
so

109
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,280
you know maybe you know you want to use

110
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,099
Yara rules to identify is this malware

111
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,799
iced ID is it Cobalt strike all these

112
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:08,879
different things

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,580
and it sounds like you know that's not

114
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,200
necessarily a complicated thing but it

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,700
really can be

116
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,160
good example you know I pick isid and

117
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,858
Cobalt strike here for a specific reason

118
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,740
IST ID leads to Cobalt strike in a lot

119
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,840
of instances because you have initial

120
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,639
access from iced ID

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,680
you start going on going on and then

122
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,199
eventually if left untreated it moves

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,880
into Cobalt strike

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,160
so you know there's some parallelism

125
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,060
here with other parts of life if you

126
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,979
you know your intelligence requirements

127
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,160
say I want to know what else is what all

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
is happening in my environment

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,120
and we're not just going to Nuke and

130
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,340
pave we're not just going to re-image a

131
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,620
machine we actually want to know like

132
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,900
ransomware precursors we want to know

133
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,880
all these different things so that we

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,180
can have timelines we can know like if

135
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,940
iced ID was left here how long would we

136
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,340
have had you know different things like

137
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,160
that of being able to you know show some

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,340
metrics show some efficiencies you know

139
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,620
the efficacy of your team

140
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,220
knowing malware identity helps out

141
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,320
um and kind of the left untreated thing

142
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,240
kind of drawing on a parallel from real

143
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,900
from I say real life from non-cyber Life

144
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,759
uh you know like pneumonia

145
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,400
yeah the ways you can get pneumonia some

146
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,840
of them are complications from other

147
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,979
viruses

148
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,080
so if you leave the virus untreated for

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,880
long enough you may end up developing

150
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,560
pneumonia if you leave on iced ID

151
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,780
untreated long enough you may eventually

152
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,600
have Cobalt strike so just being able to

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,840
you know separate those and say this is

154
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,120
definitively this family this is

155
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,100
definitively this family

156
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,500
really makes a difference

157
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,699
um

158
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,100
and again it sounds really simple

159
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,840
whenever you start looking at some of

160
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,139
the blog posts and you go okay iced ID

161
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,380
was distributed with this or async rap

162
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,199
was distributed via this

163
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,060
asynchrad is probably the one that

164
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,560
um that irritates me the most because

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,780
everybody has an article on how they

166
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,880
found async rat distributed

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,500
but it's been distributed in like every

168
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,000
way possible

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,340
so at the end of the day someone had to

170
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,680
do malware analysis to figure out all

171
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,740
right this is an entirely new strain of

172
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,020
whatever thing that was deploying it but

173
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,639
at the end of the day we still got async

174
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,539
right

175
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,759
and then finally the capabilities

176
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,180
the capability stuff can be a really

177
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,639
long tail analysis sort of thing but

178
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,020
again it depends on your Intel

179
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,639
requirements if your intelligence

180
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,300
requirements are we found X thing

181
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,880
wandering around our classified Network

182
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,100
tell us what it did tell us what it can

183
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,220
do you know maybe your classified folks

184
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,720
really want to know can it take

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,180
screenshots can it take key logs there

186
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,500
are some ways that you can estimate

187
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,840
capabilities really easily like tools

188
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,940
like Kappa from mandians things like

189
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,699
that you know those sort of things also

190
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,460
help find your overlaps between malware

191
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,919
families you start finding some malware

192
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,440
that hasn't lined up with any indicators

193
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,780
hasn't lined up with Yara signatures you

194
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,759
don't really know what it is but you

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,319
start putting together some of those

196
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,599
capabilities and say right we have a key

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,060
log we have a screenshot we have you

198
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,400
know three or four different things

199
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,220
chances are it's a rat or we know these

200
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,880
capabilities steals things from browsers

201
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,520
takes a screenshots system information

202
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,319
congratulations we have a stealer so

203
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,720
even if you don't have the identity some

204
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,060
of these can help you estimate things

205
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,220
that you should be able to know the

206
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,720
things that you should be able to get to

207
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,360
the ground truth if you want to

208
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,300
so all of this is kind of a data source

209
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
for intelligence and there are definite

210
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,060
arguments over where you can go we pay

211
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,500
for products with this

212
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,479
that's cool yeah you do pay for products

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,580
for all of this however

214
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,199
again the products get it from somewhere

215
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,380
and if those products fail

216
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,639
you still have your intelligence

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
requirements and sometimes your

218
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,539
intelligence requirements are cool what

219
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,699
are you saying I don't know God bless

220
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,580
you if you have requirements to do but

221
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,860
sometimes the the requirements are a

222
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,139
little bit you know strict you want to

223
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,060
say well if we don't know it we need to

224
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,099
find out and if you're in this situation

225
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,379
of you need to know it

226
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,479
and you know you don't have tools to

227
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,520
help you get there this is where the

228
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
malware analysis part comes in because

229
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,458
then you can go and you can

230
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,979
independently figure out what does this

231
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,779
malware do does it align with a family

232
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,659
what indicators what everything uh does

233
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,880
it talk to you

234
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,920
and kind of talking through how this

235
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,380
helps intelligence we're going to talk

236
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,899
about specific examples

237
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,980
and the first big example was uh this

238
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,580
crypto family called cipherit and it's

239
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,060
combination with Redline Steeler we

240
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,399
first saw some incidents with this

241
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,620
crypter plus the Steeler a few years

242
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,600
back and

243
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
it was kind of an interesting moment for

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
us because we started seeing activity

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,380
that

246
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,660
we thought was going to be

247
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,820
um Redline then we had to start doing

248
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,100
more analysis into it and this was how

249
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,140
we discovered that we could use malware

250
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,320
analysis to help us kind of

251
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,120
classify the different capabilities and

252
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,620
be or classify the different malware

253
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,839
components and be able to say

254
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,540
definitively malware one ends here and

255
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,180
malware 2 starts here

256
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,860
to kind of take you through a little bit

257
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,140
of background

258
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,160
cipherit is a crypter that uses autoit

259
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,860
uh it uses a really ugly obfuscated

260
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,260
autoit script if you're an autoit person

261
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,899
in the crowd I'm sorry

262
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,740
and we started seeing autoit processes

263
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,360
that were renamed they were making

264
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,860
external network connections to

265
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,959
different domains and they had some

266
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,060
weird fine string commands attached to

267
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,440
them

268
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
then finally afterwards they would start

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
executing things like remove directory

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
or delete files after a timeout

271
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,540
something like that

272
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,480
that was kind of a you know a point

273
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
where we could say chances are this is a

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,720
stealer because rats don't like to be

275
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,300
deleted rats like to live on the system

276
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,760
and be persistent right so we thought

277
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,800
okay let's take a look further down and

278
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,019
we started matching up indicators and

279
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,519
when we started matching up indicators

280
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,980
in the wild we found out that whatever

281
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,060
this autoit threat led to was Redline

282
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,240
so like most other people

283
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,519
we kind of anchored on this probably a

284
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,959
little too much

285
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,480
where we saw this activity in one

286
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
environment thought it was Redline saw

287
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,920
it in another place thought it was red

288
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,480
line saw it in third place thought it

289
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
was Redline and

290
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,740
this is kind of you know the situation

291
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,120
of

292
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,360
we started seeing additional indicators

293
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
that were different so like our our red

294
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,380
line like our puzzle piece on the left

295
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,860
would be you know we would have autoit

296
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,399
plus you know Red Line talking to a

297
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
Redline command and control but then the

298
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
ones on the left and right would have

299
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,000
different Telemetry patterns one would

300
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
talk to a domain that's never been

301
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,620
associated with Redline one made file

302
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,000
modifications that had never been

303
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,339
associated with Redline so that's where

304
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,839
we realized that we had to do a little

305
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,880
bit more analysis and we had to pick

306
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,480
things apart and figure out and one of

307
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,519
the big uh one of the big moments for me

308
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,700
was where um I got confused in it was I

309
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,740
was thinking wait a minute Red Line when

310
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,240
I started looking at the descriptions

311
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,040
and all the things from Redline Redline

312
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,800
is a Steeler made in.net framework code

313
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,440
autoit is not.net framework code so I

314
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,700
got really confused and going wait a

315
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,920
minute how does all this work anyways

316
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,160
and then after our malware analysis we

317
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,980
have a richer environment we started

318
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,680
taking apart the autoit stuff that

319
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,620
showed up in in an environment we found

320
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,019
okay there's obfuscated stuff here

321
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,959
obfuscated stuff injected into something

322
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,180
else the stuff that it injected was

323
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,519
Redline sweet we know that the injection

324
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,620
happens we know the red line was there

325
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,140
but then we picked up another malware

326
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,240
sample from another environment it had

327
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,000
that same autoit signature the same

328
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,700
behaviors but it had never talked to a

329
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,899
command and control server that was

330
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,600
associated with Redline instead it was

331
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,700
talking to ones associated with

332
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,120
Bots or you know let's start making file

333
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,700
modifications that were dlls that could

334
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,040
be used with Vadar so different

335
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,860
Telemetry patterns but a similar

336
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,139
Behavior a similar execution Behavior

337
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,079
there was enough overlap where we were

338
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,639
able to kind of get confused and go wait

339
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,860
a minute this is all related because we

340
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,480
know it is there's a high level of

341
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,940
similarity between them but the threats

342
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,339
were different just a little bit of a

343
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,320
different identity and this was what

344
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,779
malware analysis helped us with it was

345
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,260
figuring out taking the one puzzle piece

346
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,440
a red line and being able to take it

347
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,139
into multiple puzzle pieces where we can

348
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,420
tell you know here's where one zebra

349
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,880
stops and the other zebra starts here's

350
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
where cipherit started here's where it

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,740
stopped here's where control was passed

352
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,320
to cryptbots and control was passed at

353
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,899
badar different things like that so it

354
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,060
was very helpful in that sense of having

355
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,839
accuracy of language accuracy of you

356
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,959
know Association so you can actually you

357
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,240
know be able to have you know good

358
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,459
intelligence a good identification of

359
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,560
malware

360
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,079
the second big example is web server

361
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,480
exploitation and

362
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,399
this is one that has happened multiple

363
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,040
times it's not just like hey we saw this

364
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
once and it was done this was a fairly

365
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
consistent pattern that we've seen in

366
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,320
multiple web server exploitation

367
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,700
attempts

368
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,980
and the big reason I want to cover this

369
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,320
is because as intelligence analysts as

370
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,300
malware analysts we work in a largely

371
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,240
imperfect world because omniscience as a

372
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,339
service does not get invented

373
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,740
and if there was it would be called Next

374
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,019
Generation xdr plus

375
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,920
um there'd be somebody selling it and so

376
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,420
usually if you're working with any sort

377
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,160
of telemetry sources it's going to be

378
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,500
imperfect it's going to have you know

379
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,360
some sort of little gaps now I remember

380
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,120
taking forensics 508 with Rob Lee when

381
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,980
he said usually in an incident there is

382
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,019
some point where a little bit of magic

383
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,300
happens the adversary disappears

384
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,560
somewhere and they show up somewhere

385
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,720
else you don't know how they do it but

386
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,079
they did congratulations they got there

387
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,839
and if you're working with data sources

388
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,760
in the real world largely imperfect

389
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,860
again this is going to happen if you

390
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,620
have endpoint Telemetry via ADR you're

391
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,120
going to see some level of code

392
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,480
execution you're going to see certain

393
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,440
storyboard points you're going to see

394
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,839
certain plot points that happen in this

395
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,639
story and there are others that are

396
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,500
going to be invisible to you it's the

397
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
same way with network Telemetry it's the

398
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,040
same way with every Telemetry because

399
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,040
again you can't be omniscient

400
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,199
malware analysis helps fill in those

401
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,639
gaps

402
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,000
so in our case here we could see that

403
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,519
this wasn't exactly the web server part

404
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,779
but I'm going to get into that in a

405
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,540
second but you know let's say in our

406
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,420
contrived situation here we have initial

407
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,000
access credential theft uh that would be

408
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,699
like token credential access they

409
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,100
escalate privileges grab their files and

410
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,040
then X fill so previously

411
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
didn't know

412
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,180
now we know and where that kind of

413
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,820
applies to our web server incident here

414
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,100
and our original web server incident we

415
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,480
saw let's say a toleric web application

416
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,000
uh it was running as a regular IIs

417
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,459
application user

418
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,980
at some point an adversary said I can

419
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,779
exploit this thing and I can upload a

420
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,839
file they uploaded a file called r.exe

421
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,180
and they ran it and then after they ran

422
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,760
it powershell.exe started up and it

423
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,940
started up as NT Authority local system

424
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,160
that is the highest level of privilege

425
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,100
on a Windows system so they went from a

426
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,740
web application user account to the

427
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,180
highest level of privilege on this web

428
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,060
server in two steps how did they do this

429
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,100
well the answer is going to live in

430
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,660
r.exe

431
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,699
you know we have to go and retrieve that

432
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,740
executable we have to see what happened

433
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,920
and in our case when we did this we

434
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,019
ended up finding out that r.exe was

435
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,680
really a rotten potato uh exploit uh if

436
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,000
you're not familiar with rotten potato

437
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,480
exploits this is a way that adversaries

438
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,180
can manipulate Windows security tokens

439
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,759
so yeah we ended up discovering wait a

440
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,040
minute the app pool user here

441
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,199
technically was a service account which

442
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,420
meant that if you use a rotten potato

443
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,920
exploit you could tell that service

444
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,619
account I want to impersonate a token

445
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,599
for the local system

446
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,160
congratulations you're now the

447
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,020
unfettered administrator of the system

448
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,000
doesn't matter what web app account

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
you're using as long as you can get

450
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,299
there

451
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,679
and that was kind of a you know a

452
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,419
groundbreaking thing for me to kind of

453
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,939
personally realize because at that point

454
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,119
we have kind of this we have kind of an

455
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,699
incomplete narrative and we can take

456
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,340
that incomplete Narrative of half a page

457
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,559
and then now we can have more of a

458
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,020
fleshed out thing customer comes up and

459
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,700
calls and says hey how did this happen

460
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,620
you don't have to have that hard

461
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,480
conversation of

462
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,720
It's Magic dude it happens and you can

463
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,940
actually say all right we know exactly

464
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,799
what happened and here's how we can

465
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,179
prevent it from happening again in the

466
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,299
future

467
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,160
and the big final thing was talking

468
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,100
about uh one specific malware family

469
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,940
called sequel Maggie uh SQL Maggie uh

470
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,240
kind of helped drive home the points of

471
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,919
being able to use malware analysis to

472
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,020
help improve hunting and detection

473
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,280
outcomes

474
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,120
and sometimes that's because or largely

475
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,240
it was because that reporting is

476
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,640
imperfect again we live in an imperfect

477
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,740
world just like Telemetry doesn't

478
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,780
necessarily give you everything with EDR

479
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,419
with NVR with you know all the other

480
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:25,580
stuff

481
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,260
reporting that's public source and you

482
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,360
know open internet doesn't give you

483
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,559
anything or it doesn't give you

484
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,960
everything does give you some things

485
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,480
um but it's never a complete picture

486
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,460
there are always things that are left

487
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,380
out because either the author didn't

488
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,360
know that they were important

489
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,240
or maybe they were so important that the

490
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
author couldn't disclose them the

491
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,200
adversary would shut down operations

492
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,820
and that's something that came up with

493
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,559
SQL Maggie

494
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,380
SQL Mackey was uh disclosed in the last

495
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,220
year and it was disclosed with uh this

496
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,500
dcso medium blog

497
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,020
and inside the blog they talk

498
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,960
specifically about uh some hard-coded

499
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,760
backdoor capabilities

500
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,919
Maggie tries to determine if the Brute

501
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,440
Force login has administrative rights

502
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,020
in case it accidentally brute forced a

503
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,720
user successfully Maggie proceeds with

504
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,059
adding a hard-coded back door

505
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,520
or a hardcovered backdoor user

506
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,160
that is the entirety that that article

507
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,280
mentioned about the backdoor user and

508
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,660
they probably have a good reason to not

509
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,039
mention the backdoor user further

510
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,740
because if you publish an article online

511
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,160
on the internet that says by the way

512
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,679
every malware or every SQL server in the

513
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,660
world that has this malware also has

514
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,179
this account and puts the password there

515
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,799
the people that own those SQL servers

516
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,880
are going to have a bad day and they're

517
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,320
going to blame you for it

518
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
because you know you're going to have

519
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,980
somebody you know some smart alec that

520
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,600
goes and says all right I'm going to log

521
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,520
into every SQL server with this that has

522
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,500
this account and we're going to Ransom

523
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,820
it

524
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,539
so at this point we get an RFI you know

525
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,000
and we start looking through how do we

526
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
detect SQL Maggie better you know there

527
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,660
are some things that we can see there

528
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,919
are some things that we can't within

529
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,780
Point things so let's let's try to

530
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,860
figure it out

531
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,539
and

532
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,640
malware analysis helped us out here

533
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
because

534
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,059
one of the things we zoomed in on was

535
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,919
that backdoor user

536
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,840
that's a that's something you can hunt

537
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,940
for because you know you're going to

538
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,740
have your SQL Server user in the SQL

539
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,320
Server Management console you know

540
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,840
that's that's hard forensic footprint

541
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,460
here that you can get you're not going

542
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,620
to be able to hide that that much

543
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,900
um so we ended up tearing apart SQL

544
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,940
Maggie and looking through the different

545
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,360
bits of code and I have not included any

546
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,340
code screenshots in this this is the

547
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,780
closest thing to code that I've put in

548
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,299
this so no guidra no Hydra anything like

549
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,440
that

550
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,080
um so in this case we ended up finding

551
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,200
that when it executes SQL Maggie if it

552
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,179
had administrator access it would

553
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,340
execute two SQL queries

554
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,360
the exec Master add logon and exec

555
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,980
master

556
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,039
um add server roll member so we ended up

557
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,760
learning okay SQL Maggie let's say user

558
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,860
account with the name SQL agent

559
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,360
on the system

560
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,940
and not only that SQL Maggie as it as a

561
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,460
sysadmin which makes it the highest

562
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,820
level of access on a SQL Server that you

563
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,380
can possibly have

564
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,299
so that's the point where we can turn

565
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,280
around and say let's see if we can write

566
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,200
a detection for this this wasn't

567
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,700
something that was in the original blog

568
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,580
post there's no way to find that unless

569
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,200
you go and you actually pull apart the

570
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
sample itself

571
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,380
and not only can we you know make some

572
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,740
detection things out of this that's a

573
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,659
that's an artifact you can use for

574
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,840
hunting you have a hundred thousand SQL

575
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,820
servers in your environment first of all

576
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,520
I feel sorry second of all you can go

577
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,919
and you can start using Powershell or

578
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,480
you can start using some other sort of

579
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,580
tool to go and enumerate all the

580
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,860
accounts on your SQL servers you find

581
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,140
that account you instantly have

582
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,659
something to say let's go zoom in and

583
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:10,980
let's find something else that's going

584
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,140
on on the system

585
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,299
all right

586
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,240
so the biggest takeaways I want to take

587
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
away from this

588
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,320
malware analysis can help an

589
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,460
intelligence team in a few different

590
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,039
ways malware analysis helps you provide

591
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,960
Clarity to help identify malware

592
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,240
components

593
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,100
just like in the wild here you know you

594
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,299
have like

595
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,580
Predators prey they like camouflage from

596
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,799
the environment malware components can

597
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,620
often appear like squished together it's

598
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,659
not really a clear picture where you can

599
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,520
see where all right red line is

600
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,900
definitively here because it always

601
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,799
looks like this or you know autoit is

602
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,600
always here or cyber it always looks

603
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,880
like this things like that malware

604
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,000
analysis capabilities lets you figure

605
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,039
out where some components start where

606
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
some components end and help you get

607
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,559
more clear details around associations

608
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,780
they help you explain incident details

609
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,780
that aren't observed otherwise so if you

610
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,960
have EDR systems if you have Network

611
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,539
Telemetry pcap netflow whatever

612
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,860
there are certain things that those

613
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,840
Telemetry sources are good for

614
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,820
they're not good for omniscience they

615
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,980
all put you know little data points

616
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,440
together to help you explain a story

617
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,580
help you explain a scenario so malware

618
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,980
analysis comes along and it helps fill

619
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,240
those gaps with a little bit more

620
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,520
information and then finally it helps

621
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,380
you you know discover details that

622
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,360
aren't it's aren't necessarily in public

623
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,159
reporting

624
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,980
you know just like with SQL Maggie stuff

625
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,960
like that wasn't in the public reporting

626
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,940
and it was for a good reason

627
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,820
like their examples might include uh you

628
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,600
know

629
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,360
Linux malware as we kind of as we

630
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,740
learned earlier in the day with Linux

631
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,539
malware there's not a lot of reporting

632
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,640
around Linux malware so if you find a

633
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,380
sample you got to do your own analysis

634
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,820
because other people haven't written

635
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,039
much about it and if they do maybe they

636
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,419
don't think the stuff that's important

637
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,520
for you was the stuff that they wanted

638
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,860
to write about so you got to find the

639
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,539
stuff that's important to you and and

640
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,520
pick it apart to write about it

641
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,500
and one thing I don't have on this slide

642
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,799
but I do want to make sure to say is

643
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,679
for malware analysis capabilities you

644
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,480
don't necessarily even have to have a

645
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,760
full-time employee equivalence you don't

646
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,220
have to have like somebody that's a

647
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,860
dedicated analyst if you're a you know

648
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,100
50 person manufacturing place and you

649
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,740
have an mssp something like that

650
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,080
you can use a Sandbox you can use

651
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
buyer's total

652
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,460
some people frown on virus total stuff

653
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,720
but

654
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,360
you know if you have nothing it's easier

655
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,419
to start small than it is to say hey we

656
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,120
only have like a five person it team and

657
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,100
one person as a malware analyst okay

658
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,840
cool that malware analyst is also your

659
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,460
entire security team too at that point

660
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,299
probably

661
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,580
so at that point kind of start small

662
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,500
with a few different things see what

663
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,080
works for your organization and kind of

664
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,880
grow and expand from there because there

665
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,860
are some things that it's a lot easier

666
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,140
to do with a small team and then kind of

667
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,000
grow
