1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,000
I got a call last Tuesday

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,940
friend of mine security director at a

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,800
fortune platformer Mobility company and

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,960
he called me and said I was obviously as

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,820
all of us sitting upstairs in my attic

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,560
you know we had the computer blah blah

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,220
blah and um he told me like I have an

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,439
issue with the um

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,380
that even though CTI exists for a decade

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,960
still my my my teams have difficulties

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,579
in translating

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,160
threat to risk and explaining that to me

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,840
properly I was like no did you really

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,719
and I'm like okay go on go on

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,700
and he tells me like yeah we're also

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,500
using this thing called attack

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,800
looks great but I have no idea how to

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,660
present it to my peers

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,640
my bro okay that's interesting as well

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,920
that's interesting as well

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,440
and what I told him then is what I will

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,840
tell you today in the next 30 minutes

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,860
and it goes a little bit like this

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,860
um and I think personally I believe that

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,240
we in the industry have a bit of an

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
issue with storytelling

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,100
telling a story about a threat and how

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,560
to Nuance it correctly and articulate

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,720
correctly what does it mean what does it

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,220
mean for everyone what does it mean for

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,560
the different stakeholders

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,360
and one of the things I found really

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,920
useful and that that is what I explained

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,020
to my friend is that you could use

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,540
things like micro Tech structured

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,479
content in general be way more effective

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,979
in a concept I like to call threat

39
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,119
informed storytelling

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,220
and obviously this is not easy because

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,720
otherwise we wouldn't be talking about

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,220
these things we would already be doing

43
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,360
it right

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,399
that's what I'm going to be this is uh

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,380
this is the main takeaway

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,320
and all I'd like you to remember of me

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,920
is uh is that I'm a practitioner I set

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,719
up my own company focusing specifically

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,060
on cyberpet intelligence advisory and we

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,220
help any company basically in building

51
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,040
up the capability and understanding what

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,660
is going on and making that actionable

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,180
for their teams I probably like a bit of

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,340
Lego you'll probably see that as well if

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,959
I was anything else I would be a

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,140
librarian fun fact

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,620
so write a bit of contact setting

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,379
um I personally believe that inform risk

59
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,239
management is actually quite hard it is

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,819
risk management is hard but doing that

61
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,920
based on threat correctly that is even

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,260
harder sometimes and I see it as a

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,379
balancing scale a balancing scale that

64
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,140
you know and probably all of you also in

65
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,760
the digital crowds you probably have

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,800
witnessed you know the situation where

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,720
you're doing your work and then all of a

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,360
sudden somebody calls you and says hey

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,060
what is this little thing and you're

70
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,360
like yeah okay it's not a problem okay

71
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,700
but that is the kind of balancing act I

72
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,519
see every single day where we balance

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
out our understanding of the capability

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,599
of an actor or whatever

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,459
um or doing a lot of effort and

76
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,560
structuring and standardizing it

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,599
but then balancing that with operational

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,399
priorities new incidents coming in

79
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,599
and the second thing I'd like to also

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,040
address the Lego elephant in the room

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,659
for those of you who know this this is

82
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,000
the Lego UCS Millennium Falcon it is one

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,700
of the most biggest expensive sets

84
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,340
um of Lego on the planet and why did I

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,360
think that because I think it's

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,640
sometimes a good metaphor not always but

87
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,500
sometimes a good metaphor what CPI

88
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,580
actually is

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,220
it is a very costly effort to do it

90
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,620
right it takes time it takes people as

91
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,599
we talked about yesterday right the

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,459
people process technology to get it

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,019
right but if you put it in your

94
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,700
collection man you have a good

95
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,739
collection you know if you haven't told

96
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,420
me I'd like to see it

97
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,760
um but what I'd like to emphasize is

98
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,739
it's not that the Lego is cool but like

99
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,200
I like to emphasize that it's very hard

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
to do all of these things that are

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,959
associated with one big big object and

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,519
make it sure that it fits into your

103
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,040
collection that that is hard and what

104
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,019
you can sometimes see is that by that

105
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,959
balancing scale I just mentioned is that

106
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,880
it's difficult to get all the things

107
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,298
that make a CTI team successful to do

108
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,860
all of those things right

109
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,139
and what I'm what I'm usually seeing is

110
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,360
that teams then excel in one of these

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,620
areas

112
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,500
and then are are basically so successful

113
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,199
that they can't do the rest and that is

114
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,060
an interesting balance I find very

115
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,860
interesting

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,520
now where is this going into so I think

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,100
again I believe that we sometimes

118
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,740
struggle a lot I know I don't believe it

119
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,900
sometimes I think we always struggle as

120
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,479
an industry with storytelling and I

121
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,759
think that especially from the threat

122
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,680
informed aspect I think there's a couple

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,380
things we can do better coming back to

124
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,639
my friends these are some of the things

125
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,400
I told him as well

126
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,100
foreign

127
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,600
ly love this slide because it helps me

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,580
start the whole discussion about a

129
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,940
threat right do you even understand how

130
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,979
people are talking about risk in your

131
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,360
organization

132
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,880
this is a this might seem obvious for

133
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,520
most but it's I can assure you that it's

134
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,800
surely not every single day every single

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,360
week are having discussions about these

136
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,300
kind of topics to articulate what is the

137
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,160
what is what makes a rig what it makes

138
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,020
up a risk and how to start and create to

139
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,259
that but my key takeaway here is that it

140
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,520
doesn't matter which one you use it

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,900
matters that you understand it so that

142
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,880
you can talk the same language that is

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
really important

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,139
now if we go into threats and and our

145
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,600
try to understand or explain that to

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,180
somebody who isn't even closely aware of

147
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,460
what that is then I usually use a visual

148
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,539
like this

149
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,580
you have an actor that's okay brilliant

150
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,740
Dent you have a company if there's an

151
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,440
opportunity at that company then if

152
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,539
those Collide then you have a thread

153
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,300
risk reasons Inside Out flat reasons

154
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,460
outside in I keep it simple because

155
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,440
usually this works best when I try to

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,060
explain this this particular bit

157
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,020
so

158
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,759
um uh one of the things she probably

159
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,160
notes here as well is uh David's pyramid

160
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,320
uh meantime to a pyramid of pain is

161
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,360
probably now good right

162
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,000
um but what I like to see here is that

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,740
um if you go into the capability intent

164
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,600
route it's sometimes very difficult to

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,479
explain that to people who really are

166
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,880
not doing that kind of thing right

167
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,319
and then all of a sudden you try to

168
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,180
translate that into more tangible stuff

169
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,259
which could be attributed groups people

170
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,120
have a real motivation to Target you on

171
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,520
yes or no but also you have campaigns

172
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,319
and instead of just saying hey the

173
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,120
pyramid represents things that could

174
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,919
change often or are difficult to change

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
I usually I use it in a different

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,880
fashion I use it in that fashion but I

177
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,680
also use it in a way to articulate like

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
campaigns use tpps but they can change

179
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,699
often and they can use multiple of them

180
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,039
and the thing is this is exactly where

181
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,479
you see the discussion happening from

182
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,060
hey these are recognizable things you

183
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,500
know these are the things the analysts

184
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,300
actually recognize because they they

185
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,919
understand the below terms the above

186
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,780
terms are sometimes difficult but it's

187
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,340
about translating from fluffy Intel

188
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,440
content to nice and tangible stuff and

189
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,360
this is where you see structured content

190
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,960
arising

191
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,280
now this is an overview a simple

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
overview I tried to look at everything

193
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,900
structured content related and came up

194
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,099
with this

195
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,860
um the to be honest I'm always lost in

196
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,979
the weeds if I just if I if you would

197
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,380
really look at this and think hey what

198
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,360
are all the the structured content

199
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,860
options available

200
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,319
there's so many things but I'd like to

201
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,940
boil it down into something simple and

202
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,340
that's these three buckets and the first

203
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,660
one is you could actually look at it

204
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,639
like hey we have certain Frameworks a

205
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,160
knowledge basis and they use schemas and

206
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,900
machine Real Performance to encode

207
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,860
everything

208
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,900
and what that basically means just one

209
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,300
example is that you have attack they

210
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,580
structure all our data in sticks and

211
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,099
they encode everything in Json just an

212
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,780
example I'm not going through all of

213
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,340
these and that is not by the way it's

214
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,259
not the purpose of this talk because I

215
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,840
could go on for days but the purpose I

216
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,419
think is the most difficult is to

217
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,780
actually use this effectively in a theme

218
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,559
right

219
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,879
so this is a um an interesting uh I

220
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,139
think it's an awesome example I made

221
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,940
this with my friends of breakfast and

222
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,740
the the idea is that this is just a

223
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,719
briefing a briefing we give every single

224
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,020
day right as a CTI analyst but as you

225
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,500
can see that does not necessarily relate

226
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,919
right to everything right and the issue

227
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
of that is that if you try to translate

228
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,360
that into structured content it becomes

229
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,680
quite difficult

230
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,300
and I think one of this is one of the

231
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,660
issues where I see our Intel field

232
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,860
um

233
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,380
struggling is that how do you go from

234
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,660
the qualitative content to the to the

235
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,820
structured content and I personally find

236
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,140
it very interesting I find this very

237
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,019
fascinating and for example in this in

238
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,940
this case you could for example map the

239
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,080
next steps you could map certain

240
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,360
activities certain observables but you

241
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,820
cannot map an exact assessment you have

242
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,740
to put it in the description bar of for

243
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,260
example a Styx schema

244
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,580
that is not really useful

245
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,860
and even so the teams I work with they

246
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,000
ask me different questions they don't

247
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,279
ask me hey give me uh that nice briefing

248
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,779
they want to give get more tangible

249
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,339
stuff and understand how it relates to

250
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,540
each other

251
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,339
and this is an overview of a friend of

252
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,820
mine who uh who made this for a um for

253
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,500
and he presented about this in a

254
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,320
conference last year but did what I

255
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,880
actually want to illustrate here is that

256
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
we usually give the thing in The Orange

257
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,060
Box but what people actually want to

258
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,500
know is you know what do we need to do

259
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,000
about it and that is pretty difficult

260
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,339
and now if you translate that into code

261
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,200
then it looks like something like this

262
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,660
which is absolutely unreadable for the

263
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,580
normal person right

264
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,220
but I think it's an interesting it's an

265
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,040
interesting conundrum and where I think

266
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,560
this should be going towards is you know

267
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,300
we have these difficulties in getting

268
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,160
more and more PDF documents getting more

269
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,440
and more emails right

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
um I struggle with that probably more of

271
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,519
us struggle with that and I like to

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,500
reimagine that I say hey could we

273
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,839
actually break it down into basically

274
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,300
different chunks of information that we

275
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,800
could if we query a different question

276
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,260
that we can get a different output

277
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,940
obviously this is a real simplified

278
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,040
example but you probably get the point

279
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,600
and this is the kind of things I'd like

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,380
to reimagine

281
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,480
now obviously I told my friend which I

282
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,680
mentioned in the beginning I told them

283
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,740
like hey so how are we gonna do this or

284
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,540
do you want to want me to show you an

285
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,300
example I said sure let me show you so

286
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,579
what I'm about to show you is is more an

287
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,920
example how I do this this is not meant

288
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,959
to be the example this is meant to show

289
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,420
my example and I encourage you to find

290
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,220
your own examples and try something

291
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,899
experiment and let me know how that

292
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,720
works right

293
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,300
so in essence uh I like my Intel

294
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,620
deliverables to look something like this

295
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,320
obviously with uh not visually like this

296
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,260
but the the concept of Storytelling

297
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,060
tells you that this is about a penguin

298
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,160
creating a penguin right it tells you

299
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,779
everything you need to know about what

300
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,940
is needed for that it tells you the

301
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,339
sequence it tells you exactly how the

302
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,980
different things fit together and I find

303
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,940
that a great metaphor to say hey this is

304
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,519
how your Intel product fits in your team

305
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,160
in your organization

306
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,839
obviously there's a simplified example

307
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,120
it's not that simple but this is the the

308
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,399
things I'm straving uh aiming towards

309
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,579
now what I did is I created a sort of

310
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,100
like a framework aspect a framework

311
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,079
concept which I call scenarios I

312
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,700
published it on GitHub

313
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,620
um and people are free to grab it free

314
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,899
to use it but my idea was hey let me

315
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,240
just figure out how I can use this and

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
reason why I created my own thing

317
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,540
because I I wasn't really able to use

318
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,339
all the different Frameworks existing

319
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,839
Frameworks together in a narrative

320
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,940
format to explain to my stakeholders

321
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,480
like how do I articulate threat to risk

322
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,700
so what I'm doing I create a scenario

323
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,200
format I'm interlinking that with

324
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,640
different existing structures but

325
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,100
content models creating codified

326
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,040
versions of that and I collaborate with

327
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,560
Academia to extend this this into the

328
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,200
existing models right because I don't

329
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
want to create yet a lot of framework

330
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,740
because there are like a lot but I think

331
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,420
it's really useful to get that going and

332
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm actually trialing this right now in

333
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,360
the private sector to see what works and

334
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,339
get that going in in real life

335
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,079
and how that then works for me is then

336
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,820
if I if I actually are able to

337
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,360
articulate hey this is what it's about

338
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,860
this is what this particular problem set

339
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,320
is about then I can articulate these are

340
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,300
the components that are associated with

341
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,700
that right what does that mean that

342
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,680
means that you have different blocks you

343
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,540
have white blocks Black Blocks small

344
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,480
blocks large blocks Wheels Etc but you

345
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,980
know the differences and this is the

346
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,360
kind of thing where the alignment of

347
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,579
Storytelling comes in right

348
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,560
and in particular the scenario for

349
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
example I'm able to tag and annotate

350
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,800
everything so that I can actually

351
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,000
investigate faster

352
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,620
now even so you probably have seen these

353
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,200
kind of things a Playbook an adversary

354
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,480
Playbook I thought about this car this

355
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,700
topic as well for many years but the

356
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,459
thing I found is that it's not really

357
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,160
sometimes easy to explain simply this is

358
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,079
what group a does and give an actor

359
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,380
profile and then translate that into how

360
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,880
does that affect the themes in practice

361
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,279
and have that discussion right but it is

362
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,600
quite important and why is that

363
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,120
important because as you all know any

364
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,820
actor or red team or whatever they

365
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,980
basically find loopholes right they find

366
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,839
a loophole to say Hey how do we exploit

367
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,639
penguin feet you know then we should

368
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,740
probably start by you know exploring the

369
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,959
white block and then the Black Block

370
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,880
Etc you know but knowing that sequence

371
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,160
and knowing those components

372
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
that helps you to actually understand

373
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,279
and you need to tag it all together

374
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,959
now thirdly

375
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,060
um I always what I always use and that's

376
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,040
what I also told my friend is a

377
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,579
narrative based explanation a narrative

378
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,240
based context of what is going on and

379
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,700
this is very very underappreciated in

380
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,839
our industry

381
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,820
why is it in the uh under appreciated

382
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,579
because one this takes time and two it's

383
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,740
people sometimes want simple answers but

384
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,300
the reality is it's not that simple

385
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,820
right because if you want to know where

386
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,260
exactly

387
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,980
excuse me where um where an exploited

388
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,380
them happens or you know if you get a a

389
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,600
set a report where certain findings are

390
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,639
and you you get an explanation like hey

391
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,320
we are we're exploiting penguin feet

392
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,300
yeah we did it by doing one two or three

393
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,040
you know take it all together a little

394
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,500
loophole but the discussion that is not

395
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,899
often happening is where are we

396
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,480
defending you know is that happened in

397
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
in in the latter stage of an attack

398
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,820
chain but where do we want the defend is

399
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,680
that exactly you know fixing it over

400
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,199
there is that actually useful and maybe

401
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,660
we should fix it over there did the

402
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,240
problem Arise at stage four three or

403
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,300
even one right but that discussion does

404
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,160
not happen often it does not happen

405
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,680
explicit and narratives helps you to

406
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,420
actually articulate that better

407
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,540
now one thing I also use because I'm

408
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,579
doing this kind of thing that also helps

409
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,519
me to analyze things faster if I have a

410
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,620
structure in place then I can actually

411
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,620
use it to to to search through all these

412
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,880
scenarios

413
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,040
what I showed my friend is like okay so

414
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,320
you're you're a seizure at a at a

415
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,240
certain company and you talk to me about

416
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,579
let's say wipers for example that's the

417
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,980
example on screen now now there's this

418
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,620
tool called obsidian as free as a

419
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,779
resource anyone can actually use it

420
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,000
but you can just load in scenarios and

421
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,699
you could start doing this now you know

422
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,160
it doesn't cost anything only your time

423
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,560
right but the thing is I was able to pop

424
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,420
up like hey these are the these are the

425
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,040
this is my understanding of the latest

426
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,320
small RC or the wiper scene and this is

427
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,639
what has happened because it was all in

428
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,959
the scenario and I could be able to

429
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,360
explain explicitly hey these are the

430
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,519
steps people usually take

431
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,760
and that and that is also yeah that that

432
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,220
just takes time but it saves you so much

433
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,519
time

434
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,820
um

435
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,699
I I I I

436
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,320
think one of the things that is also

437
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,019
very underappreciated sometimes is what

438
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,940
you all already have in your

439
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,360
organizations we don't uh sorry my dear

440
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,160
friends we don't need the more expensive

441
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,100
technology or we don't need the most

442
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,199
expensive technological solutions we

443
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,699
just need smart people and good process

444
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,740
that's my opinion right but sometimes

445
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,320
automation is really needed right but

446
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,660
why I'm asking you is to be creative

447
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,240
right this is an example of uh

448
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,160
insights and this is a asset management

449
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,099
tool

450
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,780
yes and as a management tool but

451
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,579
everyone on the planet uses here all

452
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,740
right maybe a show of hands who uses

453
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,660
jira

454
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,819
that's actually a lot there's like 30 30

455
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,319
or something

456
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,199
and I think it's not just a ticketing

457
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,880
system it's also a knowledge based

458
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,160
system right you can also use the asset

459
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,520
management function but you could also

460
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,840
repurpose it and then you can actually

461
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,960
if you just change the labels all of a

462
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,980
sudden you have a thread tracking a

463
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,919
concept where you could relate threats

464
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,220
to risk to control and then actually you

465
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,380
can assess how effective your controls

466
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,179
are this is very unappreciated in our

467
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,980
scenes sometimes we usually talk about

468
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,960
the details but we don't necessarily

469
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,580
talk about how that rolls up into your

470
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,260
entity or into our organization

471
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,760
my key takeaway for all of you is look

472
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
at your own team look at your own

473
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,780
technology stack and be creative huh if

474
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,520
there's one person who's a very seasoned

475
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,320
and power bi hey have a chat with that

476
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,900
person or with yira find something like

477
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,720
this identify how your stakeholders are

478
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
working how they're operating most

479
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
importantly where they are reporting

480
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,080
into and then you can link everything

481
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,080
you do into that that sometimes saves

482
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,678
you a lot of time

483
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,240
now

484
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,419
where is this all going right struck we

485
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,760
talked about structured content

486
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,220
constructive content is it was just one

487
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,919
slide as I just presented it and that is

488
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,500
maybe an oversimplification but I just

489
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,760
want to say there's a lot of things

490
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,280
going on in that in that area

491
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,860
but there's a few that stand out and as

492
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,380
as we just saw in the quiz there's only

493
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,020
a couple that stand out the hexagon

494
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,419
model in in particular right

495
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,179
but what I'd like to also take you with

496
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,940
give you a bit of a takeaway is that

497
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,980
there's also stuff happening that is

498
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,780
actually taking all of that and going

499
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,840
beyond that and there's this model for

500
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,140
uh for workflows called cacao and I'm

501
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,400
actually pretty pretty interested in

502
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,020
this kind of stuff and why am I so

503
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,340
interested in stuff because it's not

504
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,100
just allows me to translate what is

505
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,960
happening like an incident or anything

506
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,059
and translate that into an attack

507
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,980
sequence and translate the attack

508
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,320
sequence into small or procedural level

509
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,320
uh chunks of code which then my

510
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,880
adversary emulation teams can then

511
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,460
reproduce in an environment but it tells

512
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,179
me the entire sequence right and what

513
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,220
this particular where this industry is

514
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,200
moving towards is that you now are able

515
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,000
to not just say hey this is the attack

516
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,220
Playbook but this is also simultaneously

517
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,080
the defense Playbook

518
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
and this isn't this is new this is novel

519
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,940
this is novel uh in terms of what is

520
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,980
going on but where I think this should

521
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,620
be going is for those of you who still

522
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,440
remember the movie Minority Report 20

523
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,240
years ago right where you have the hand

524
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,280
you have hand gestures where you could

525
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,919
go through the data really effectively I

526
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,419
think that is where we should be going

527
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,360
and to be honest we're not that far off

528
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,740
from that

529
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,679
but the only way how we can do that is

530
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,500
that by standardizing the research we're

531
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,960
doing right now making it understandable

532
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,100
for for also the machines that help us

533
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,280
the protocol the the algorithms right

534
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,919
last few days we uh we talked a lot

535
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,620
about with beers right

536
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,900
um about things like machine certain

537
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,360
machine learning models but I'd like to

538
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,160
emphasize that these are just tools to

539
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,100
get our do our work faster right and

540
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,380
especially if we get into these areas

541
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,600
and we are able to instead of just

542
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,120
making a good incident report if we're

543
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,940
able to also codify that then we can

544
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,799
share it exponentially with different

545
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,280
teams faster better Etc and technology

546
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,419
is hitting us fast right technology is

547
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,820
grabbing us from left to right and we

548
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,679
need to be ready and you know they're

549
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,960
way better it's kind that is way better

550
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
than you know reading PDF documents

551
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,919
probably than than we are so we better

552
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,440
prep for that no one can all I'm saying

553
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,179
is this is the kind of area where I

554
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,760
expect this all to go towards that an

555
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,220
area where where the the different

556
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,640
existing Frameworks Collide into one but

557
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,919
focused on telling the whole story

558
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,220
now I'm going a bit faster than I was

559
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,260
expecting which is fine that leaves some

560
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,179
time for questions but I'd like to send

561
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,880
you off with a couple of of key aspects

562
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,500
which I personally think are very

563
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,900
important my main takeaway for you today

564
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,240
is start doing this start thinking about

565
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,640
this the moment you get home for those

566
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,620
of you at home like Euro you can start

567
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,020
today you can start right now right

568
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,140
but I'd like you to think about hey how

569
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,880
can we do something different with our

570
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,460
existing data set can we codify things

571
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,400
right can we maybe instead of writing

572
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
all sorts of reports and emulating it

573
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,240
out to our teams maybe we can already

574
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,520
start codifying certain things and make

575
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,980
it scalable internally you know

576
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,960
there's probably a lot of people who

577
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,480
have some issues with actual sharing it

578
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,059
telling the threat story from one team

579
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,740
to the other right

580
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,260
and and this actually helps you to then

581
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,179
say well detection engineering teams

582
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,799
here are the procedures we actually need

583
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,840
to investigate and they're tacted these

584
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,000
particular techniques and maybe risk

585
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
management teams these techniques are

586
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,919
associated with these particular set of

587
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,559
risks you are tracking right

588
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,080
and I'd like to also emphasize that you

589
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,059
know people come to me including my

590
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,799
friend and they said yeah but I'm not

591
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,480
mature and I'm like no that is not

592
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,080
correct even even so

593
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,760
people who call themselves less mature

594
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,159
teams they are more effective in

595
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,960
adopting the change associated with

596
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,760
these kind of things right and that's

597
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,440
and simply because it's much easier

598
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,720
they're sometimes afraid that

599
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
why should we do it

600
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,340
second and that is the key with this

601
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,260
whole storytelling thing is that you can

602
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,299
align with the priorities of your

603
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,340
stakeholders this particular bit of

604
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,340
Storytelling is about a stakeholder

605
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,960
engagement and telling the right story

606
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,360
with the right people right and making

607
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,159
sure that people know if they want to

608
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,600
know more details then they can go into

609
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,059
more details right but also being able

610
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,620
to summarize upwards and actually

611
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,600
understand what is going on

612
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,580
and I think there's um

613
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,460
I also touched upon this that it is

614
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,860
sometimes needed to actually have

615
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,260
machine readable sharing things like

616
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,419
Miss right we cannot live without it

617
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,539
anymore we'll stop you know

618
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,840
and um I think this is the this is the

619
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,520
most important element talking right

620
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
language with the right stakeholders

621
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,340
finally

622
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,080
reimagine the approach you're currently

623
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,880
having to storytelling

624
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,220
and this may sound so simple you I'm not

625
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,960
expecting you to write to write the

626
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,940
Disney products by the way so don't come

627
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,740
back at me and say hey I'm making this

628
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,500
thing what I'm trying to tell you is

629
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,159
that using a narrative format in

630
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,140
intelligent deliverables is very

631
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,280
effective

632
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,860
and especially if you don't have a lot

633
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,460
of time to explain to your boss why one

634
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,900
thing is more important than the other

635
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,120
if you're talking about certain Steelers

636
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,380
or whatever and if you try to

637
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,360
contextualize that in the current threat

638
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,280
landscape that is sometimes really hard

639
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,740
but it helps to tell a story and the

640
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,960
best part is they will remember it even

641
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,260
better

642
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:37,559
now

643
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,260
what what this all uh what will this all

644
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,179
result into

645
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,120
it it is quite simple it will allow you

646
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,659
to uh to explain you talk about penguins

647
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,280
with their Executives and not just

648
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,320
Penguins not crocodiles no mutually

649
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,840
exclusive collectively exhausted you're

650
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,340
talking about penguins the right things

651
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,100
but the managers or people who actually

652
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,900
need more understanding of the context

653
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,360
you could talk about sequences right you

654
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,340
can talk about how things one takes bits

655
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,600
to the other how it's all compiled

656
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,480
together and finally talking about the

657
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,059
detail-oriented folks um how does the

658
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,100
little things fit together and how does

659
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,600
that work

660
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,159
I'd like to leave it at that and open it

661
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,110
up for questions thank you

662
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,460
[Applause]
