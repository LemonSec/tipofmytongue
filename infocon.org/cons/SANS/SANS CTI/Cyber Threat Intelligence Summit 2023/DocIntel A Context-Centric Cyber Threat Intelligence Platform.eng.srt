1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
hi everybody so it's my pleasure today

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to introduce you to uh doc Intel um

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,759
first of all a little bit um about me

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,379
because of banji we are obliged to give

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,960
a fun fact so my name is Antoine I'm

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,060
I've been developing code since I'm four

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,119
years old I am and I have a PhD in

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,640
computer science and a risk analysis and

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,340
the fun facts is um I'm a student in a

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,619
cook school and I've been spending hours

12
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,380
in ambulances over the last 10 years I

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,000
currently I worked at the Belgian

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,579
defense where I try to provide the best

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,920
of my expertise

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm I think that I do not need to repeat

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,719
that today but it's still good to hammer

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,579
the same nail so cyber threat

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,100
intelligence is is key it's becoming

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,840
more and more important in organization

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,680
but we all face one problem is that we

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,440
get intelligence or at least data I'm

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,440
really really fast and at the volume and

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,320
the scale that it is Inc that is

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,280
increasing but we have a very mixed

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,560
um data added comments in we have very

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,140
technical data with malware analysis but

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,299
we also have very strategic data with

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,380
like geopolite geopolitical analysis I'm

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,619
and so we have specific needs as cyber

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,540
threat intelligence analyst and so we

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,100
need specific tools

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,020
most of the tools that we have today

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,600
they are focused on structured data and

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,579
on technical indicators I think that

36
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,680
many presentations over these last two

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,979
days have spoken about these unstructed

38
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,380
data the technical indicators but we

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,960
need the context I most of the time the

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,060
yada yada that we have in reports we

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,759
need that at some point and

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,880
um that's one of the key problems that

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,180
we try to solve with a documentary among

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,920
the challenges that we have Knowledge

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,320
Management is hard but in particular

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,399
there are multiple problems that are

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
specifically important for a CTI teams

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,538
so the availability and the control of

49
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,819
the information that we get

50
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,400
um we need all our team members to

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
access the threat reports but we don't

52
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,180
want other people to access those

53
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,580
reports so it's important to control

54
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,680
that information we also need to be able

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,140
to search efficiently in all those

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,780
networks include including with these

57
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,060
obfuscated indicators and that's where

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,180
for example CTI has specifically needs

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,640
all tools but we also have other

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,620
problems like we need the information to

61
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,500
be categorized to be at least a little

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,319
bit organized so we can find it back uh

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,080
we have experts that okay share and

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,060
their expertise with uh your

65
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,220
organization but we want to keep the

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,739
knowledge they share because maybe at

67
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:56,819
some point they will leave for another

68
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,040
company for another organization but we

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,900
still want to keep all the knowledge

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,660
that have given to the organization over

71
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,440
the years I'm tracking the sources and

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,260
how reliable they are it's also very

73
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,480
important for a good quality pet

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,040
intelligence

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,019
um and because of the volume because of

76
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,239
the speed we want to automate as much as

77
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,860
we can and

78
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,220
reduce the workloads on the analysts

79
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,099
I'm speaking about availability and

80
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,760
control I we have reports everywhere I'm

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,620
you will get back onto your

82
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,599
organizations with the slide deck that

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,280
they've been presented over these two

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,260
days those slide Decks that are not

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,879
available on internet you will probably

86
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,220
not find it if you just Google at least

87
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,920
or some of them you have all these um

88
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
vendors that are selling reports and to

89
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,239
access those reports you need to connect

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,400
to their portal and to search in the

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,379
airport that's fine if you only have one

92
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,019
vendor I'm but if you have multiple ones

93
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,840
that's sometimes very painful

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
then we have all the folder on all

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,060
workstation with reports in there and

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,700
that's very hard to search in them I'm

97
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,420
difficult to share with um Junior

98
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,280
analysts that just joined the team for

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,319
example so it's very time consuming to

100
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,700
search in all these sources and

101
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,560
sometimes it's even impossible to search

102
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,139
in all those sources

103
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,820
and searching

104
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,919
um as I mentioned we have specific needs

105
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,600
we want to search for exact traces

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,580
sometimes for harmonica we want to

107
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,560
search for approximate terms for example

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
with some credits names I every vendor

109
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,460
come with a variation uh on that

110
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,380
specific name and we also want to search

111
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,560
for obfuscated indicators for example if

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,120
you have that IP address and you are

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,100
looking for that one you want to find

114
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,720
the report that mentioned that IP

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,280
address even if it is obfuscated I'm and

116
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,380
you want to find that efficiently and

117
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,419
closely

118
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,400
so what is dock Intel that can tell is a

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,960
centralized knowledge base for your

120
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,759
credit intelligence reports the key

121
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,380
objective is to make all the threat

122
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,560
reports available to every member of the

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
Cyber threat intelligence team

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,820
to facilitate the search so you can find

125
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,259
the information back and to encourage

126
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,000
the collaboration between all the

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,460
analysts the goal is to replace the

128
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,699
folder that we have that is named

129
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,919
reports and to replace this vendor

130
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,620
information portals that are painful to

131
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,520
use

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,860
and the focus is really on context not

133
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,020
really on technical indicators most of

134
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,699
the time those reports are like the

135
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,820
starting point of our investigations I'm

136
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,520
and that's the focus of staff

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,280
so five years ago the organization I

138
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,680
worked or I'm we were tracking all the

139
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,539
reports that we received

140
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,660
um using an Excel sheets and

141
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,479
there is a better way I because it's

142
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,000
time consuming I you can only have one

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,740
analyst that is opening the file at the

144
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,780
same time but it does not really work it

145
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,699
does not really scale

146
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,780
um and we were looking for another

147
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,020
solution nowadays we have a documentary

148
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,720
so that's the the home page of the uh um

149
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,039
of Doc Intel

150
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,139
um and that's my own page it's

151
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,139
personalized to my need to the specific

152
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,900
tags that I'm interested in

153
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,300
I will dive into a little bit more

154
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,800
details on how the information is

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,919
structured but on that page I can go to

156
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,419
the report and then I can read the

157
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,340
report directly in the web application

158
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,800
right so I can see the title I can see

159
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,720
the summary that has been written by the

160
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,000
analyst I can see how it has been tagged

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
and categorized I can view the sources I

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,460
can view the rating of The Source I can

163
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,560
view when it was ingested when it was

164
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,680
updated and I can read the report all in

165
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,080
one single interface

166
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,440
I can also view I'm restricted data that

167
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,479
has been extracted from the report so

168
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,860
for example here we have a bunch of

169
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,440
hashes I'm those have been extracted

170
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,380
from the document and they are ready I'm

171
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,300
readily available in the application I

172
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,000
can search for them I can export them I

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,100
can export them to excel so I can do the

174
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
rest of my analysis

175
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,780
the key features of talking 10 are the

176
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,819
following ones the first and Central

177
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,539
feature is search and filtering on on

178
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,580
these search so you can quickly find the

179
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,740
relevant information you need to start

180
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,180
your investigation to start your

181
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,639
analysis the goal is to organize the

182
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,220
knowledge and we use tags for that time

183
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,340
to track and read your sources so you

184
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,720
know where the information comes from

185
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,419
and to control the information so not

186
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,979
everyone has access to the same

187
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,660
information

188
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,060
the key concepts are the following ones

189
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,699
I'm at the core of Doc intelli is the

190
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,680
concept of document a document is a

191
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,500
bunch of files that are coherent for

192
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,440
example uh you receive a PDF Report with

193
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,020
the CSV with a bunch of IP addresses a

194
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,060
new bundle all those files under a

195
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,500
document the document has a title

196
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,020
description and tags

197
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,660
um that you that will help you organize

198
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,300
informations so we use tags to organize

199
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,940
the information and we group the tags in

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,220
coherent set that we call facets so a

201
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,740
facet is a set of tags that is coherent

202
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,720
so for example here we have a bunch of

203
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,759
countries that are tags in the facet

204
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,340
Target country so we use that to

205
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,199
categorize a threat report that

206
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,340
mentioned for example an attack

207
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,500
targeting a specific country so I can

208
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,539
find back all the reports that mentioned

209
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,060
an attack that has targeted a specific

210
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,099
country we have different facets for

211
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,319
example here with software

212
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,500
all documents are written by sources and

213
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,240
we keep track of all those sources we

214
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,039
can read those sources so we have

215
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,799
General analysts back in Focus only on

216
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,440
sources that have been vetted by the

217
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,940
Cyber threat intelligence team for

218
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,260
example

219
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,140
we have comments um and we use that in

220
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,200
two different ways the first way is that

221
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,060
I'm when you receive a report sometimes

222
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,040
you take action on the reports or you

223
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
share the report you search in your cm

224
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,019
and you can record informally all those

225
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,899
actions in the comments we also use that

226
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,560
to share the expertise for example if a

227
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,540
report mentions a malware and you have a

228
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,459
malware analyst that check the reports

229
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,920
and say okay that's mostly correct but

230
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
they are missing that step or that step

231
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,459
then they can record that as a comment

232
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,200
and that's knowledge that you keep even

233
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,300
if that malware analyst live near also

234
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,140
issue

235
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,300
then we have structured data although

236
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,820
it's not the focus of Doc Intel it is

237
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,519
there and it's backed by a synapse I say

238
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,339
you can reuse all their good work and uh

239
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,920
and just have it displayed in a

240
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,339
documentary you can subscribe it's a

241
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,180
very much like a YouTube I you can go to

242
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,040
a tag or go to a source and then you

243
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,800
subscribe to that tag of that source and

244
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,040
you will receive I'm Taylor newsletter

245
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,779
on a daily basis there's a new report

246
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,779
that matches your subscription also your

247
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,300
own page is personalized based on the

248
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,519
subscription you had so not all analysts

249
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,100
see the same homepage

250
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,260
we have also a whole and permissions

251
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,540
that allow you to control precisely what

252
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,420
a user can do and cannot do it's very

253
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,360
fine grained because in larger team you

254
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,100
have often

255
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,220
um much high well-defined goals that are

256
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,779
important to keep

257
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,820
we have a layer of automation using

258
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
importers and scrapers that will gather

259
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,720
the information and populate the

260
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
database for you

261
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,140
and then we have groups that helps you

262
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,120
control work and see the information so

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,980
you can release a document to a specific

264
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,959
group and making sure that nobody

265
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,200
outside the Rope will be able to see the

266
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,540
document

267
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,880
if you can search on Amazon to find the

268
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,920
right product you can search on the

269
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,019
printed you have a search bar and then

270
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,120
you have filters that help you fine-tune

271
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,760
your search exactly the same you have a

272
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,500
search bar and you have filters that

273
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,120
help you find the writing code so for

274
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,640
example here and you might be looking

275
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,060
for log4j no idy has been popular

276
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,579
sometime and then you have all these

277
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,500
reports and then you can fine tune your

278
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,480
research based on the tags that you have

279
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,079
used when I do encoded the document

280
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,060
encoding the documents it takes a

281
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,339
quite a long time it's quite a workload

282
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,019
for most of the team

283
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,060
um and so doc Intel is there with a

284
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,820
bunch of features to help you streamline

285
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,300
that processing so it will do its best

286
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,640
to extract the metadata the tags based

287
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,680
on the keywords or regular expressions

288
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
for example if a report mentioned a CV

289
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,540
then it will strike that information for

290
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,839
you and it will also extract as much as

291
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,600
it can on strict your data like IP

292
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,860
addresses or URLs or domains but it's

293
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,260
really like an Air Traffic Control

294
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,620
software it's not that it's not there to

295
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,480
replace the user it's there to assist

296
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,940
the user so the user still has to review

297
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,560
the information that has been extracted

298
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,420
so we ensure that we only have high

299
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,640
quality

300
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,620
registered documents

301
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,899
I'm the rest of the presentation I will

302
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,880
just show you one of the use case that

303
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,660
we have I think that many CTI teams

304
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,820
um do some sort of daily collection and

305
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,700
processing ones like reviewing what's

306
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,959
going on today

307
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,959
I'm so for example you found a new

308
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,240
articles and that articles is quite open

309
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,980
for your organization it's interesting

310
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,560
for you what you can do is just

311
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,440
um copy paste the URL of that that blog

312
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,320
post give it to Doc Intel and then a

313
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,300
documentary will fetch the document for

314
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,820
you we'll try to remove the ads the menu

315
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,000
and all that just to extract the content

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,740
and then it will preprocess the document

317
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,600
and it will be available for you to

318
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,700
register so for example here that's the

319
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,019
top item I'm it went to the internet got

320
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,720
the article and so that a bunch of

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,519
techniques were mentioned in there a

322
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,019
bunch of software were mentioned in

323
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,300
there and it's pre-processed the

324
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,519
document for you all you need to do now

325
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,820
is to edit that so for example I can

326
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,800
edit the title I can add a small

327
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
description about on that report I can

328
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,420
check the tags

329
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,820
I can check the source and the

330
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,560
classification in that case okay it

331
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,820
comes from internet so it's in

332
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,139
classified

333
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,079
um and available to everyone then I can

334
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,120
review all the observables so all the

335
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,860
structured data that's been extracted by

336
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,959
two so for example here I can review the

337
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,839
hashes I can review the domains

338
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,300
um and I can tell doc Intel okay that's

339
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,100
a URL that

340
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,800
um I want to keep and that that is in

341
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,839
your url that I do not want to keep and

342
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,720
I do not want you to ask me that later

343
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,260
so for example I mentioned okay for us

344
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,019
not interesting to ingest so I will just

345
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,560
tell doc Intel do not suggest any URL

346
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
that that matches that domain so the

347
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,540
system will learn I'm the ones that you

348
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,899
don't want in your collection and it

349
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,720
will not propose that again so it makes

350
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,920
the process more efficient over time

351
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,839
when it's fully registered you can view

352
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,220
the document you can view all the

353
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,420
structural information that you

354
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,540
extracted and it's available for you to

355
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,120
search so you can search for it and

356
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,040
start

357
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,459
there is a little bit more but in the

358
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,579
time that I had I'm I I could not

359
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,560
present to you all the features it's a

360
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,820
tool that we have been developing for

361
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,860
four years and so for example we have a

362
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,240
bunch of features to automate your

363
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,800
collection but we support some

364
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
commercial feeds

365
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,300
um that will be fetched automatically

366
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,660
and fed into our dog can tell directly

367
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,079
we support LSS feeds and so you can just

368
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,899
add your NSS feed and then doc Intel

369
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,180
will go to the website extract the

370
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,220
content generate a PDF pre-process the

371
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,720
document for you

372
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,240
um so you can enjoy your coffee

373
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,279
you can get lazy also because you can

374
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,500
get notified for all the reports I think

375
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,360
that come into the platform and that

376
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,180
matches what you need so for example

377
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,800
let's say that I'm interested in Chinese

378
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,940
threats I can subscribe to the tag

379
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,040
source geography China for example and

380
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,600
then I get a notification every time

381
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,040
there is a report that has been added

382
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,160
and that much is what I

383
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,740
of course you have plenty of tags and it

384
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,660
might be painful for a new organization

385
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,560
to generate all these tasks all these

386
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,980
tags so you can import existing

387
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,779
taxonomies existing galaxies or one

388
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,899
English or whatever so you can

389
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,820
pre-populate and help you bootstrap your

390
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,880
referral using the tool

391
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,519
we integrate with different tools and

392
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,079
different processes because there is a

393
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,500
complete API that you can use to

394
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,839
integrate with other scripts that you um

395
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,519
that your organization might be using

396
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,820
you can push document automatically into

397
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,279
the doc Intel or retrieve all the

398
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,339
observables that were ingested over the

399
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,920
last for example in two days

400
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,839
you can control what the user can see

401
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,600
and what the user can do you have groups

402
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,120
and classifications that help you find

403
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,760
you in a

404
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,040
dissemination of the information and we

405
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,660
have roles and permission that really

406
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,940
helps you decide what the user can do

407
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,800
and what the user accounts

408
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,620
I'm on top of that there is a layer of

409
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,620
security because we are in the field of

410
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,019
server security so we like to be sure

411
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,120
that nobody is badly handling all data

412
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,680
um so we have multi-factor

413
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
authentication we integrate with active

414
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,240
directories and we provide an extensive

415
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,980
Audi clock so you can always review

416
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,740
whether your specific user has done in

417
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,139
the application what reports yes what

418
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,480
people see has downloaded

419
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,060
under the hood it's a significantly

420
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,220
large c-sharp application that use

421
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,579
the.net framework I'm and for storing

422
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,679
the information it use a podcast

423
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,380
database and a Vertex synapse database

424
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,599
that has been mentioned this morning

425
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,059
um that is used to store all the

426
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,799
structured information so if you already

427
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,679
have such an instance running you can

428
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,459
just connect doc Intel to your existing

429
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,140
instance and when you are reading a

430
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,520
report if there are contextual

431
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,699
information that is known in your vertex

432
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,620
synapse instance will be displayed

433
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,360
and it's a free and open source

434
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,700
application so you can download the code

435
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,679
you can review the code you can install

436
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,980
it and we recommend Docker to just

437
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,520
deploy the application I we have a bunch

438
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,740
of users that are testing it so feel

439
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,660
free to test feel free to report all the

440
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,840
bugs that you find and you can find even

441
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,020
more information on our website I also

442
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,240
encourage you to join the slack Channel

443
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,960
if you are interested by the tool

444
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,520
all right

445
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,700
yeah so in a in a conclusion that's a an

446
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,640
open source platform for storing

447
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,380
organizing and searching in all your

448
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,960
documents mostly related to cybercrats

449
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,600
it will provide a searchable central

450
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,840
repository for all these threat reports

451
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,820
um it has been proven to improve the

452
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,799
consolidation and the dissemination of

453
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,500
the knowledge in organizations the tool

454
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,140
has been built for the analysts and

455
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,580
they've used it

456
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,660
um for the last four years I'm

457
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,240
the focus is on context on all these

458
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,419
yada yada I'm and on reports not on

459
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,100
technical indicators which makes the

460
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,480
platform a little bit different from

461
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,299
other open source software if you have

462
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,580
any question I will be really glad to

463
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,220
answer them now I also feel free to ping

464
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,880
me on Twitter or on the slack or later

465
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,580
this week thank you

466
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,660
[Music]

467
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,080
thank you
