1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,500
to hear all the different talks and to

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,660
see things that are mentioned in the

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,820
previous talks you know that I was also

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,020
going to mention as well so I'm going to

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,420
try to tie things together as much as I

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,160
can and um

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,279
yeah so we've talked um I remember

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,900
Sherman Chu gave an awesome talk where

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,640
he was talking about people technology

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,500
and processes I'm really going to be

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,960
telling my story through the lens of the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,180
technology

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,739
specifically this thing called synapse

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,780
which is

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,340
which is pretty cool I'm going to talk a

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,780
little bit about it

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,980
um

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,860
and so yeah let's move on

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,200
the

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,420
the first thing I want to mention and

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,920
hopefully this will uh

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,059
um give me some credibility is that I've

24
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,199
been working with synapse since about

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,760
2017

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,800
um so definitely a big fan I think uh

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,300
some of the teams I've been on have been

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,820
some of the first users I worked for a

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,559
company called extra hop which does

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119
network security and we um

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,220
we're setting up a new intelligence team

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,740
and so from my perspective when you're

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,299
doing intelligence

34
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,760
uh the one of the first things you need

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,799
to think about is your database

36
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,020
um the job of intelligence oftentimes is

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,600
relating the old to the new

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,460
um if you have something that's entirely

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,020
new you've never seen before

40
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,759
um oftentimes the

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,740
um the intelligence binding is hey this

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,060
is brand new we haven't seen it before

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,740
or if you find something that you've

44
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,360
seen a million times

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,619
um that also isn't particularly

46
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,759
interesting

47
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,600
um but

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,820
we're kind of at that edge of expanding

49
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,380
the knowledge taking something that

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,479
maybe wasn't known before

51
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,939
um discovering it and then eventually

52
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,299
what we've what we found is that uh is

53
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,060
pretty well known so

54
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,619
when you're going to do this you want to

55
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,140
have the best database possible

56
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,540
um and really I was trying to think if I

57
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,860
was forced to do intelligence without

58
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,500
this database to back me could I do it

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,240
anymore because I've Incorporated the

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,520
the thoughts and the data scheme of so

61
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,220
much into my my thinking that it might

62
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,500
be challenging for me to to back out and

63
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,459
not use this um

64
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,120
and so I'm going to do a little bit of

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,620
introduction about the platform for

66
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,900
those of you who aren't familiar with it

67
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,080
um I'm going to talk about the database

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
considerations again

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,739
um when you are doing threat

70
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,660
intelligence um what you know as a

71
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,340
company is very important

72
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,680
um and I'm going to talk about maybe how

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,819
many databases you're going to set up

74
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,840
how they're going to relate to each

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,280
other and where your synapse fits into

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,379
that whole process I'm going to talk

77
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,300
about the data schema

78
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,040
um which again is something that we've

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,440
we've touched on in several talks um I'm

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
actually a big fan of jira as well I've

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,819
used jira for storing intelligence

82
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,400
um for

83
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,620
uh for this but you know the

84
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,480
the synapse database is going to be at

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,860
the more technical level you're going to

86
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,900
be keeping track of ioc's

87
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,099
um domains IPS files file hashes strings

88
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,019
things like that

89
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,519
um we're also going to talk about

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,379
analyst workflows so when you're talking

91
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,819
about the people processes and

92
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,739
Technology you have to think about how

93
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,540
the people processes and Technology all

94
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,940
work together and I'm going to show how

95
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,920
that works with synapse

96
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,260
and then I'm going to show

97
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,720
uh basically how you document this and

98
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,060
this is the idea of

99
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,560
um making sure that everybody's on the

100
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,760
same page I'm actually a huge

101
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,500
performance proponent of documentation

102
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,420
and how it can help you and then finally

103
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,400
what the outputs look like from a

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,220
technical system like this

105
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,860
I I think that um I want to be very

106
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,200
clear like I'm a I'm a sample of one I

107
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,819
can share my six years of experience

108
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,680
using this tool other teams are going to

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
have different uses for it and so

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
um at the same time I think that six

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,180
years of experience

112
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,720
um

113
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,400
is going to give me some insights that

114
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,260
maybe you can all benefit from because I

115
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,640
know this is a tool that's growing a lot

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,799
and so I really want to

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,840
um help the new the new generation

118
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
excuse me the new generation who is

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
adopting this tool because I know it's

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,540
actually growing in popularity quite a

121
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,599
bit

122
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,918
um so when you're thinking about your

123
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,600
database for your Intel team

124
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
um most of us work for companies that

125
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,440
are a hundred if not a thousand you know

126
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,300
or more people how do you all stay on

127
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,280
the same page right

128
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,720
um one of your analysts do you spend

129
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,340
them a lot of time to be smart and they

130
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,320
come up with a finding and you want to

131
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,979
say you know across your company you

132
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,600
want to take advantage of of that

133
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,220
insight and that analysis and that

134
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,160
knowledge so if you have 100 people in

135
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,259
your company how do you or a thousand or

136
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,820
more how do you keep everybody on the

137
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,199
same page

138
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,360
um and something like synapse a

139
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
technical database is great

140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,220
um you can say pick an IPA address that

141
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,600
might be of interest maybe it's an IP

142
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,979
address that just came out in a

143
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,080
prominence uh blog or or something and

144
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,180
you have questions across the company

145
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,800
you can make this your single source of

146
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,479
Truth everybody across your company can

147
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,040
have the same visibility and the same

148
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,540
understanding as your smartest

149
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,940
intelligence analyst and I think that's

150
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,100
huge I think um especially when you have

151
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,220
multi multi multi-function teams you

152
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,139
might have some stock analysts you might

153
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,540
have some incident responders you really

154
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,639
want to have the same the same view of

155
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,139
the world right and again taking

156
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,419
advantage of the smart analysis that

157
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,880
you've done this is a way that you can

158
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
again keep keep everybody on the same

159
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
page

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
um another another thing I really like

161
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,500
about this particular technology is that

162
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,199
the the data model matches the real

163
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,100
world

164
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,960
um I think I think sometimes computers

165
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,460
are so complicated and you know we have

166
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,600
a lot of things that we need to keep

167
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,699
track of but they do have a physics to

168
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,199
them certain things talk to each other

169
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,759
in a certain way

170
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
um you know certain

171
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
certain things happen repeatedly you can

172
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,020
think of how how DNS IPS

173
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,660
uh and domains all relate to each other

174
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,639
that stays kind of the same and it's

175
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,020
really nice to have a data model that

176
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,000
you can just go to that matches that

177
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,400
real world because then if you know how

178
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,139
computers work you kind of know how the

179
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,120
data model works as well because they go

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,100
so closely together

181
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,160
um also something that maybe we don't

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,880
um

183
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,740
think about but we definitely should is

184
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,020
the idea that you have evidence and you

185
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,460
have analysis and those are not the same

186
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,660
thing and so when you're keeping track

187
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,240
of them you want to keep track of them

188
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,759
um in different ways and and make sure

189
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,620
that it's very clear and

190
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,300
allow it so that you could revisit your

191
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
assessment maybe you do make a mistake

192
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,539
um I think a lot of us don't like to

193
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,979
think about that if we make a mistake

194
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,960
but what if you make a mistake and you

195
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,060
want to back back out and redo your

196
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,460
analysis can you separate the two can

197
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,139
you separate what you know from what you

198
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,819
assessed

199
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,100
um in a very clear way

200
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,319
also um

201
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,960
one thing that I really enjoyed was The

202
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,460
Bletchley Park talk where they were

203
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,139
talking about the index files that you

204
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,180
have these index files that keep track

205
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,560
of everything and allow them to do

206
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,220
lookups I mean I think that you can

207
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,840
almost draw a line from The Bletchley

208
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,120
Park index files to this technology

209
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,979
because

210
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,199
it's the same thing like they had a

211
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,120
technology like maybe there was a weapon

212
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,380
system that they wanted to look up in

213
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,880
their files and so they had these

214
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,740
indexes that would allow them to do that

215
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,979
this is the same kind of thing like we

216
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:20,759
have

217
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,440
complicated questions that we're going

218
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,199
to ask of our databases and we

219
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,699
um computers are complicated right so

220
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,080
that makes our questions complicated

221
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,919
it's not always going to be

222
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,599
straightforward it's not always going to

223
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,039
be a keyword search I think most

224
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,400
platforms support a keyword search but

225
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,580
um can you do pivots and filters and a

226
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,840
whole bunch of complicated stuff along

227
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
the way to get answers to your most

228
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,039
complicated questions

229
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,599
I'm going to show an example in the next

230
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,759
slide um just to give people an idea of

231
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,380
what that can look like

232
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,500
um made by analysts for analysts you

233
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,900
just feel kind of in your happy place

234
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,000
when you're an analyst working with this

235
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,280
technology because you can tell that

236
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,380
they were really thinking of you and I

237
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,139
really appreciate that and I I think it

238
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,960
really comes through with the technology

239
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,319
um performant and scalable a lot of

240
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
Technologies when you're trying to keep

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,039
track of indicators do one-to-one

242
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,680
relationships

243
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,860
and has anybody ever run into the

244
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,120
127.0.0.1 problem when you're dealing

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,979
with database like that

246
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,099
um you can you can really start to have

247
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,620
to make what I would say are our

248
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,539
compromises when you when you model

249
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,159
things

250
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,279
um in certain Technologies but synapse

251
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,719
again I don't want to get too much under

252
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,640
the under the hood but the hypergraph

253
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,339
technology allows you to

254
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,299
um

255
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,760
allows you to what I would say is again

256
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,040
model things in a real world way that

257
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,800
makes sense that allows you to Pivot in

258
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
amazing ways

259
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,180
um also I think a lot of people

260
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,580
um have a lot of different vendors right

261
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,320
you might have

262
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,380
um call it five vendors and

263
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,839
when you're doing that analysis you know

264
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,519
you don't first of all you don't want to

265
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
go to five different uh platforms to

266
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
look up the same IP address or the same

267
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,640
domain you want to

268
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,360
um

269
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,180
really like if I if I'm asking about an

270
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,260
IP address I just want to ask about that

271
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,700
IP address I don't have to ask the same

272
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,860
question five different times

273
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,580
um

274
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,920
and

275
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,200
and also because

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
um you can integrate your vendor tools

277
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,760
with with this technology

278
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
um things like metrics become really

279
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,540
awesome you can actually see how often

280
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,980
am I using the data from the different

281
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,899
vendors and then you can search to do a

282
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,220
vendor assessment

283
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,660
um as far as how often you're actually

284
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,040
going to use that data to create

285
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,260
intelligence products which is a big fan

286
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,899
which I'm a big fan of

287
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,760
I like metrics

288
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,339
um and so this is just one example

289
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,060
um

290
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,980
I don't know about anybody in here but

291
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,540
if you've used the technology where you

292
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,519
have to like right click on something on

293
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,899
an indicator to look up more information

294
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,519
and you can you have to do that for

295
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,500
maybe 10 different indicators

296
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,360
um I love the fact that you can do many

297
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
to many pivots meaning show me all the

298
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,820
IP addresses that I've attributed to a

299
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,140
particular group

300
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,700
um then I want to Pivot across all those

301
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,519
DNX records to perhaps a different you

302
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,380
know a set of domains

303
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,200
um also you can do

304
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,180
what what are called subquery filters

305
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,279
which is something where you can

306
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,260
basically say I want to look for nodes

307
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,480
that are connected via some sort of an

308
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,820
edge to to other nodes or I want to

309
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,339
remove things or connected via an edge

310
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,200
to other nodes so you could say I'm

311
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,880
looking for DNS records but I just don't

312
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,200
want to see the ones that are connected

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,220
to to trivial indicators like

314
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,019
127.0.1 or maybe um eight that eight

315
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,120
that eight that eight so I just put one

316
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
example up here I don't want to go over

317
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,800
it too much but

318
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,940
um

319
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,440
you know let's say I want to start with

320
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,240
this domain that might be in a domain of

321
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,040
interest and then I want to Pivot to all

322
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,779
the DNS records

323
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,000
um specifically the dnsra records but

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
then

325
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm I'm coming in in the morning I only

326
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,040
want to look at one day's worth of data

327
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,079
so I'm going to filter that down to just

328
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,180
the previous day between one day ago and

329
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,700
now go to the IP addresses and then

330
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,440
remove all the ones that I've already

331
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,240
found are associated with the threat

332
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,680
group that I'm researching which in this

333
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,420
case is apd28

334
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,860
because I already know about those I'm

335
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,420
looking for something new and then

336
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,220
basically I want to go to passive total

337
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,260
and pull in new records

338
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,000
um the syntax may look a little scary

339
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,320
but

340
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,180
um number one if you use it a lot it

341
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,640
becomes very second nature also

342
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,680
um you can create macros so for common

343
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,660
tasks and you don't want to have to keep

344
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,000
typing things repeatedly you can shorten

345
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,519
it and also that helps the uh

346
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,980
the new users to get over the learning

347
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,279
curve

348
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,240
and so again

349
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,260
um

350
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,420
because uh

351
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,100
I think I have some unique experiences

352
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,920
as far as setting up this technology I

353
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,120
just want to share some lessons learned

354
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
as far as like what it actually looks

355
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,540
like to deploy this technology at your

356
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,800
company

357
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,160
um and again also feel free to hang up

358
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,839
with uh more detailed questions because

359
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,640
I think probably a lot of people are

360
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,140
going to be in similar situations if

361
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,399
you're trying to set up a technology

362
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,160
like this and um also I'm just very

363
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,959
happy you know to to help

364
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,959
and it's also worth mentioning which um

365
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,040
Katie also mentioned the beginning

366
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,660
there's there's two versions there's an

367
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,860
open source version which is available

368
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,779
on GitHub and there's a Enterprise

369
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,459
version you can buy

370
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,899
um if you buy the Enterprise version it

371
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,700
will save you development time

372
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,680
um and it will also help smooth that

373
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,240
user experience

374
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,980
um but for the talk I'm going to be

375
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,940
talking about the open source

376
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,480
okay so you're all set you're going to

377
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,740
you've made the commitment and you've

378
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,579
decided you're going to move forward

379
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,839
with synapse

380
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,560
um

381
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,880
one of the first things to think about

382
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,100
is where is your data

383
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
um it's going to be somewhere right now

384
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,000
and um if you're like a lot of people

385
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,519
it's going to be an S3 it might be in a

386
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,680
postgres it might be in Dynamo it might

387
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,420
be in Snowflake

388
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,200
um

389
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,600
one of the first questions is what do

390
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,760
you bring into synapse um I like to

391
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,000
think of synapse the technology as it's

392
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,339
like the surface of your desk it is not

393
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,839
like the filing cabinet that you have

394
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,459
next to your deck

395
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,279
um when you are an analyst you're

396
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,079
looking at specific things

397
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,540
um in the course of your day and you're

398
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,920
not going to be looking at everything in

399
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,940
your filing cabinet you're going to be

400
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,560
having an active workspace in front of

401
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,339
you

402
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,380
um that you're working with and so

403
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,480
you know one of the questions is what do

404
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,560
you bring in

405
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,680
um

406
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,260
and one of the first questions is how

407
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,760
much data do you have

408
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,620
um I realize that that's a vague

409
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,180
question and and depending on your

410
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,320
organization

411
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,560
um you might view big differently but

412
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,600
um one one data source I've used in the

413
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
past is the virustotal feed which is

414
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,380
massive we're talking a million or two

415
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,540
million rows a day of data

416
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,339
um do you actually want to bring that

417
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,079
into your active workspace and again

418
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,360
keep in mind that you have your filing

419
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,800
cabinet and you have your desk in front

420
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,660
of you

421
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,800
um

422
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,300
throughout the course of the day you're

423
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,459
only going to be looking at a finite

424
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,920
number of ips or domains or or other

425
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,139
other indicators

426
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:16,920
um

427
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,860
and so really the question is can you

428
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,380
leave it where it is maybe it's going to

429
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,540
be a lot easier for you to set up an

430
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,040
integration between whatever your

431
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,139
intelligence platform is

432
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,079
um whether it's synapse or another

433
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,300
platform and and perhaps if you can

434
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,000
create an integration you can

435
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
um leave it where it is and then only

436
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,180
bring in information that's related to

437
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,620
what you're actively working on or your

438
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,779
active investigation

439
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,440
um

440
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
something to keep in mind there though

441
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
is you know again

442
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
um how quickly are you going to need it

443
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,000
um I kind of like

444
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
have a uh a thought with with certain

445
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,680
Technologies

446
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,459
um

447
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,320
where if you knew what you needed

448
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,060
yesterday like if you know what you're

449
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,320
gonna need today and you knew that

450
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,300
yesterday maybe you could use a certain

451
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,240
technology to store the data but if

452
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,500
you're analysts are going to be forming

453
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,240
real-time enrichments from another

454
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,519
database they need

455
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
um something that's going to return you

456
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,820
know I would say 30 seconds to a minute

457
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,740
right they can't be waiting there for 30

458
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,380
minutes for their query to return so how

459
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,760
quickly are they going to need it is it

460
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,620
something that's going to be blocking

461
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,480
their active investigation blocking

462
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,920
their workflow

463
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,079
um if it is then maybe you need it in

464
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,459
something like snowflake that's going to

465
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,920
respond much more much more quickly than

466
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,199
something like Athena

467
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,600
and like I said if you did know

468
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,639
yesterday what your analyst might be

469
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
working on today then maybe you can do

470
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,740
some pre-enrichments along the way you

471
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,899
can do some pre-lookups I'm essentially

472
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,320
bringing the data from uh yesterday's

473
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,899
alerts and have it all ready to go in

474
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,339
the morning that's kind of how we do it

475
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,779
at our company as we know that we're

476
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,860
going to be looking at the alerts from

477
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,380
the previous day so you can actually say

478
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,660
okay I'm just going to bring in all of

479
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,000
the the relevant enrichments for the set

480
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
of data that I know I'm going to be

481
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,040
working on tomorrow

482
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,060
um for those of you who have ever looked

483
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,800
at the synapse documentation um there's

484
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,500
something like 400 different node types

485
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,019
which is awesome in the sense that

486
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,240
whatever type of intelligence work

487
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,560
you're going to be doing the data model

488
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,660
is probably going to support it but I

489
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,279
think that gets really overwhelming and

490
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,360
if you're like me and you go to The

491
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,740
Cheesecake Factory and you see that menu

492
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,779
and you're leafing through the and

493
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,579
you're leafing through the entire menu

494
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,019
like

495
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,060
I love a restaurant that has like 10

496
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,620
items you know give me like your 10 best

497
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,139
items I'm gonna pick one of those

498
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,360
um and I think with with synapse you

499
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,160
have to think of the same thing like on

500
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,860
the screen here I have an organization

501
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,380
node a log event which is essentially

502
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,079
think of as like an alert or a detection

503
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,959
um some IPS some domains and then

504
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,420
um some outside enrichment information I

505
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,680
mean that's really not that overwhelming

506
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,440
right and so you can start there all the

507
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,060
other options are still available to you

508
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,679
they're not you're not closing up any

509
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,959
paths by simplifying you're just really

510
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,119
going to focus on your use case and

511
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,220
what's most important for you at that

512
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,000
time

513
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
um and that's that's kind of how I tell

514
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,299
people to

515
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,459
to get introduced to the platform is to

516
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,819
start start simple and and like I said

517
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,900
um

518
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,880
whatever you end up doing whether it's

519
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,679
going to be host analysis or whether

520
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,760
you're going to be doing more network

521
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,860
analysis they've got you covered um

522
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,980
within the data model so you can you can

523
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,660
then at that point

524
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,039
um you know decide where you're gonna go

525
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,340
um and actually I'm going to call do a

526
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,080
call back to Chris Sanders talk at the

527
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,919
very beginning

528
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,179
um because he was talking about the most

529
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,520
efficient investigative paths and that

530
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
was really cool because at the end of

531
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,799
the day you're trying to save your

532
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,780
analyst time there's so much data to

533
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,780
look at every day and you really um

534
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,220
you really don't want them to have to do

535
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,600
anything

536
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,179
um manually twice you can do something

537
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,640
manually once and say okay you know that

538
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,620
like that happens if you have to do

539
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,380
something manually two times at that

540
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,340
point you want to start thinking about

541
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,020
how do we automate this how do we speed

542
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,360
this up how do we make it so that our

543
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,419
analysts can can move really fast I

544
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,120
mentioned macros sometimes you have a

545
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,100
workflow that you do repeatedly and it

546
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,140
might be fairly complicated

547
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,000
I I take a lot of those and I make them

548
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
into a short macro it reduces a command

549
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,100
down to maybe 20 characters and then I

550
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,900
don't have to you know repeat repeat

551
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,419
that every single time

552
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,320
um

553
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,140
and really you want your analysts to

554
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,000
have all the obstacles and hurdles

555
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
cleared out of their way

556
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,000
um so that they can just focus on what

557
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
their value-added aspect is which is

558
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,580
going to be that that analyst component

559
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,120
um

560
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,500
and so

561
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,919
this this tool is not just a database it

562
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,600
also has essentially an automation

563
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,419
engine built in so you can say

564
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,039
I'm going to set up some crons person

565
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,419
think that I need to happen at certain

566
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,000
times if you're like me and you have a

567
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,820
fairly limited virus total quota I'm

568
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,580
going to at the end of the day set up a

569
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,620
Cron job to use up all my code at the

570
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,000
end of the day

571
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,460
um so that I get the most value from my

572
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,320
uh my spend

573
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,020
also you have things like

574
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,740
indicator specific enrichments when an

575
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,600
IP address is added maybe you want to do

576
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,820
a passive lookup or a passive DNS lookup

577
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,559
or maybe when a domain is added you want

578
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,580
to try to pull in uh you know what files

579
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,780
might be connecting to that domain

580
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,600
there's there's the sky is the limit and

581
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,620
it's really going to come down to your

582
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,799
use cases but again

583
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,700
if because of the platform and and also

584
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,960
if you think about the difference

585
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,460
between your developers time and your

586
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,260
analyst time A lot of times your

587
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,640
analysts don't want to have to fill out

588
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,640
requests for development time if they

589
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,380
can just create an Automation in the

590
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,660
system themselves that's gonna that's

591
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,179
gonna be very efficient for them so

592
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,740
the things on the screen are things

593
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,780
where analysts can kind of take the

594
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,120
control into their own hands and not

595
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,860
have to fill out a development request

596
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,120
you know the jira ticket with

597
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,700
justifications things like that you you

598
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,919
you really empower the analysts by

599
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,780
giving them these these automation

600
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,539
engine capabilities uh themselves

601
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,260
um

602
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,280
when you when you think about the

603
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,660
knowledge of your organization and all

604
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,220
staying on the same page you have to

605
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,120
essentially

606
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,580
um make sure that when one person in

607
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,780
your organization says something and

608
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,820
another person in the organization says

609
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,900
something that they're speaking the same

610
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,220
language

611
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,440
um if your company attributes a specific

612
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,299
indicator to a threat group or a

613
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,880
specific malware family making sure that

614
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,740
it's going to be very clear

615
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,880
um through everybody working on the

616
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,980
system what exactly that means what the

617
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,100
confidence level might be what

618
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,280
what the language used is so

619
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,440
um I mentioned that there's a data model

620
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,720
within synapse and it's very

621
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,620
um

622
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,840
it's very robust but it actually does

623
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,460
not come with a tagging structure you

624
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,740
have to make that your own so you have

625
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,179
to come up with a taking structure you

626
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,240
can borrow the one that um the company

627
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,520
the vertex project uses who writes the

628
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,620
software or you can come up with your

629
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,299
own tagging structure and this is where

630
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,820
as an intelligence team and we've talked

631
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,679
about this throughout the past couple

632
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,380
days is you have requirements you have

633
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,299
outputs you have people who are asking

634
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,940
you for answers to specific questions

635
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,860
that's going to drive what your tagging

636
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,380
structure looks like

637
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,880
um data mappings this is like one of the

638
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,880
absolute best things about Synapse

639
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
um I think a lot of the best CTI

640
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,980
analysts that I've known are very very

641
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,020
um focused on normalizing

642
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,539
the different data sources and so if you

643
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,799
have

644
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,539
um an IP address in one database and

645
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,059
another database in another database

646
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:54,900
normalizing that so that they all look

647
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,820
the same when you bring them into your

648
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,940
your platform your your database and so

649
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,179
every single time we bring in a new data

650
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,940
source into synapse we do a data mapping

651
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,799
it's on a Wiki internally so we can make

652
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,659
sure that everything is mapped

653
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,100
appropriately and normalized

654
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,320
appropriately

655
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,120
and duplicates get merged and this is

656
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,059
how you get to that one node

657
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,880
um for one indicator concept where again

658
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,440
if I'm asking a question about a

659
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,179
specific IP address I want to see my

660
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,280
answer in one place not in 10 different

661
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,200
entries

662
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,260
um and then also another thing we do

663
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,840
um is just we we use

664
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,299
um get for keeping track of all the

665
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,280
different automations that we've created

666
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,140
within the within the tool they're

667
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,880
self-documented within the tool and you

668
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,760
can have them there but also just for

669
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,580
um Version Control and for communication

670
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,260
amongst different people on the team we

671
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,820
find it useful to have the code just

672
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,220
laid out there and tracking tracking

673
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,299
changes and things like that

674
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,179
and then finally output this is going to

675
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,159
be driven by your use case

676
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,960
um like I mentioned before I'm going

677
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,840
through a day's worth of alerts and

678
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,179
looking and seeing what I can find I

679
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,480
find it's useful to output a lot of the

680
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,539
relevant data to a CSV and then once I

681
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,799
find something of Interest I go back

682
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,419
into the platform to perform further

683
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,580
investigation

684
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,299
but you know your use case might vary

685
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:26,580
also again if you if you buy the

686
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,140
Enterprise version you can smooth your

687
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,520
experience because of their user

688
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,640
interface and some of the the

689
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,700
tools they have for outputting the data

690
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,400
also if you're supporting some sort of

691
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,960
stock or IR function you could think

692
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,419
about a chat bot we can essentially plug

693
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,280
into your synapse instance and respond

694
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,260
back with a really smart answer on

695
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,360
whatever's being asked

696
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,000
um and again I love this picture it's

697
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,440
one of my favorite pictures and I really

698
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,299
view you know

699
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,860
um synapse as being right in the middle

700
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,419
of the

701
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,120
of this data information intelligence

702
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,559
process you're

703
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,900
you're normalizing it you're processing

704
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,460
it and you're going to make it very

705
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,780
exploitable

706
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,980
um

707
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,980
I feel like once you do a lot of this

708
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,200
prep work to get the system modeled or

709
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,419
to get your data modeled in the system

710
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,280
um then it allows you as an analyst to

711
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,658
move really fast like I said

712
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,760
um so in summary uh I've covered a lot

713
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,340
of ground and I really want to

714
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,320
emphasize that please do come up and ask

715
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,000
questions because I think

716
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,260
um different organizations that find

717
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,520
themselves in the position where they're

718
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,559
trying to get going for the first time

719
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,460
um you might have a lot of questions

720
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,100
about how do you consider setting up

721
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,320
your databases and and Integrations

722
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
ingestions

723
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,679
um how would you set up your schema how

724
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,059
do you set up those analyst workflows

725
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,159
what does that actually look like

726
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,500
um and then I talked about documentation

727
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,539
which um if you know me that's just

728
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,919
something I'd love to talk about but I

729
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,419
don't know if everyone wants to hear me

730
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,220
talk about it and then thinking about

731
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,600
what your outputs from the system are

732
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,100
going to be

733
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,799
um I want to thank again everybody for

734
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,700

735

awesome uh relate you know related

737
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,280
information to what I talked about I

738
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,500
love how this field ties together and we

739
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,000
keep talking about related things

740
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
hopefully um you found this this

741
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,280
