1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,900
foreign

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,540
thanks guys uh so my name is Drew

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,540
Schmidt I am the uh lead analyst for the

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,740
guidepoint research and intelligence

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,820
team and today we're going to be talking

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,560
a little bit about ransomware rebranding

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
and ultimately why it's so hot right now

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,900
so a little bit about me I've been in

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,019
I.T infosec sock defer threaten towel

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,180
malware for quite a while

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,680
um I kind of landed on malware that's

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,300
one of the things I just really like to

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,600
to dive into and and really kind of put

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
a lot of my time

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,559
um but enough about that um we can talk

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,140
later about who I am and what I do but

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,180
what I want to get into is ransomware

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,120
rebranding so to start off I just want

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
to take a little bit of a step back and

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,719
just look at ransomware rebranding as

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,539
it's occurred since basically 2020 and

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,219
then getting get into a little bit of

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,960
case studies to look at why ransomware

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,059
rebranding is so effective

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,559
then I want to get into some tips and

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,059
tricks for how we can actually identify

27
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,280
what ransomware rebranding is doing and

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,500
and how it's progressing through from

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,020
Rebrand to Rebrand before we figure out

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,280
you know how do we take all this

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,260
information and put a lot of this

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,520
knowledge to work

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,380
um the last talk did a really good a

34
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,119
really good explanation of a lot of that

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,979
piece so I'm glad that happened

36
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,540
beforehand but

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,360
um we'll kind of wrap it up with that

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,759
so to start with ransomware rebranding

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,100
it's so hot right now

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,900
um Hive right in the middle

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,340
um is going to be probably a really good

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,740
example of why rebranding is is so

43
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,060
successful and ultimately why it's

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,220
important for us to take a look into

45
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,560
rebranding so that we can stay up to

46
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,920
date with what threat actors are doing

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,100
so to begin with this is a graph of

48
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,259
publicly posted ransomware victims from

49
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,600
2022 and this comes straight out of our

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,280
annual ransomware report that we just

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,920
put out last week and what you see in

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,380
the blue or in the solid line is the

53
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,240
number of posts that went on throughout

54
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,060
2022 the dotted green line is actually

55
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,799
the number of groups that were active at

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,840
any given week during

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,180
um during 2022. so the one thing really

58
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,098
to to pay attention to other than the

59
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,840
fact that ransomware is obviously a huge

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,239
problem is at any given time there were

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,239
11.2 active groups that were posting

62
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,300
victims to public sites now this is a

63
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,640
very high number and and ultimately as

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,800
we go through 2022 we see that this

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
number went up and down

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,879
so when we think about ransomware as a

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,640
large problem obviously that's obvious

68
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,280
but as we dive in a little bit deeper we

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,260
can see exactly why it's a problem and

70
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,000
why it's a little bit harder for us to

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,239
track from a CTI perspective

72
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,700
so to start with ransomware rebranding

73
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,860
has been around for quite a while we've

74
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,260
seen groups like maids we've seen Gan

75
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,180
crab become Rebel we've seen e Gregor

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,000
Hive Conti a whole bunch of evil Corp

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
variations all this has been going on

78
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,140
for a long time even longer than we've

79
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,360
been talking about it as rebranding

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,459
so

81
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,260
one of the things that we did was we

82
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,580
wanted to break this down a little bit

83
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,560
more get a little bit more granular to

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,959
have a taxonomy for how we should talk

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,000
about ransomware and specifically

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,360
rebranding so on the x-axis of this

87
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,860
little chart here we have kind of the

88
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,140
duration of operations and on the y-axis

89
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,420
we have activity and so we came up with

90
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,099
this idea where we have different types

91
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,959
of groups one is going to be full time

92
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,700
these are the groups that are operating

93
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,980
for long periods of time they have long

94
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,480
consistent activity they have

95
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,700
well-established infrastructure

96
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,599
well-established ttps and they're

97
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,360
operating for again a very long time

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,720
now rebrands are going to be kind of the

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,480
the offshoots of a full-time group that

100
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,879
have to go through a free brand for any

101
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,560
number of reasons Hive is going to be a

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,840
great example of what we see in terms of

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,519
Rebrand activity

104
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,340
now Splinter groups are going to be more

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,379
of an offshoot maybe it's an affiliate

106
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,239
that decides to go out on their own or

107
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,280
it's going to be some other smaller

108
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,319
group that is an offshoot from either a

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,299
full-time or a Rebrand group a little

110
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,840
bit more erratic less established ttps

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,220
um and ultimately they haven't been

112
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,140
around for for all that long

113
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,120
and lastly we have ephemeral groups now

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,799
these are very interesting because

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,480
they're the ones that are a flash in the

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,819
pan they're there for a second then

117
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,100
they're not and these particular groups

118
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,320
might be used for any kind of uh

119
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,660
specific targeted operation

120
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,520
um but ultimately they're there for such

121
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,020
a short period of time that all they

122
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,080
really do is add a lot of noise for us

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,940
so the thing to understand about the way

124
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,860
that we think about ransomware groups

125
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,840
and the taxonomy that we created is that

126
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
a lot of these groups will move between

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,979
different types they may start as

128
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,840
ephemeral and move into a splinter group

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
or ultimately full-time or maybe they

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,560
come in as a Rebrand and move to full

131
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,720
time but there's a lot of movement that

132
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,780
happens with ransomware groups

133
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,240
and so what this results in and then

134
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,220
what we found is when we break this down

135
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,440
into these different types of groups we

136
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,780
see some interesting trends so the dark

137
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,460
blue are the uh the lighter Blue Line

138
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,199
rather is going to be our full-time

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,800
groups and as 22 or 2022 progressed we

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,360
actually see their activity being pretty

141
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,860
consistent with a little bit of a drop

142
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,360
towards Q4

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
the darker line darker blue line is

144
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
going to be rebrands and those are the

145
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,139
ones that started off 2022 a little bit

146
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,120
lower and steadily progressed through

147
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
the remainder of 2022 and ultimately

148
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,320
converged with the full-time groups

149
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,880
which is exactly what you would expect

150
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
when you think about what a what a

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,259
Rebrand group is and what they do

152
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,880
now what's a little bit more interesting

153
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,080
is when we start taking a look at

154
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,699
Splinter groups and ephemeral groups and

155
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,139
how I mentioned that a lot of times

156
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,419
these groups are ultimately causing some

157
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,060
noise for us these are consistent uh

158
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,560
they are there were consistent Trends

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,139
throughout pretty much all of 2022 with

160
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,880
respect to Splinter groups and ephemeral

161
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
groups and how they actually popped up

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,020
and went away at any given time so again

163
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,240
that noise makes a little bit more

164
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
difficult for us to track these

165
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,600
ransomware groups as they go throughout

166
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,560
2022 and ultimately when you break them

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,320
into individual categories you see how

168
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,759
they contribute to the overall

169
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,620
ransomware activity at any given time

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,000
so you might be thinking to yourself

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,220
well why ransomware rebrands and

172
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,100
ultimately it goes down into the 5Ds of

173
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,580
rebranding which is Dodge duck dip dive

174
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,960
and Dodge

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
in all seriousness all seriousness

176
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,979
though a lot of what we're doing here is

177
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,539
we're flying under the radar we want to

178
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,699
make it harder for intelligence analysts

179
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,160
to track we want to make it uh easier

180
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
for us to extend our operations or for

181
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,039
the thread actors to extend their

182
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,560
operations and we just ultimately or

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,360
they ultimately don't want to be caught

184
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,819
right and so that is the entire purpose

185
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,819
of rebranding

186
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,639
so what does this do to us well it's

187
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,620
another group for us to track it's

188
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,840
another League site disgrade there's a

189
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,120
whole slew of behaviors and ttps we need

190
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,400
to learn there's all kinds of

191
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,860
intelligence that ends up being fed

192
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,960
through this never-ending cycle

193
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,020
so it's ultimately harder on us right

194
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,758
and that's exactly what they want

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,479
so my wife actually took this picture of

196
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,100
me when I was preparing for this looking

197
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,259
at some of the case studies of

198
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,479
ransomware rebranding and so I really

199
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
wanted to take a look and show you guys

200
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,660
how effective ransomware rebranding can

201
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,340
be

202
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,520
so to begin we have all these different

203
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,259
groups and they all operate on different

204
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,380
uh different life cycles so this chart

205
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,120
shows you the active days are the

206
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
average days that group any one type of

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,039
group was active in 2022.

208
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,440
full-time groups unsurprisingly were the

209
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,940
most active they're operating pretty

210
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,300
much all year rebrands are going to be

211
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,940
active in the um you know a little bit

212
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,319
less than a full-time group but they're

213
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,699
starting to approach that full-time

214
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,039
status that's their goal they went from

215
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,560
probably a previous full-time group to a

216
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,699
Rebrand and now they're trying to

217
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,160
achieve that status again the Splinter

218
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,199
groups are usually going to be

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,240
you know Affiliates that have experience

220
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,319
in the game

221
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,840
and they're moving forward to really

222
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,699
achieve that long-term status and that

223
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,080
full-time status

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,400
but the one thing that's really

225
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,080
interesting here is the ephemeral groups

226
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,300
and those lit only lasted on average 21

227
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,800
days

228
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,660
um again this makes it difficult for us

229
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,880
from a CTI perspective to make sure that

230
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,319
we're tracking these groups we're

231
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,900
defining ttps behaviors and really

232
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,860
starting to use that to inform our risk

233
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,960
profiled and how we're going to use this

234
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,940
type of data to effectively track

235
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,860
ransomware and and the threats that we

236
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,960
face

237
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
so the first case study that I dove into

238
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,099
here was dark side to black matter to

239
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,700
Alpha so to start here we have Darkseid

240
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,120
that that was active for about 200 days

241
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,500
um then we had black matter that took

242
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,480
over for about 90 days and then we got

243
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
into Alpha which has been operating

244
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,600
basically ever since

245
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,519
so when you actually look at the

246
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,519
Timeline there's two very distinct dates

247
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,920
that correlate with the rebrands the

248
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,420
first one was the colonial pipeline

249
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,200
attack

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,839
the second one was a shutdown from black

251
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,040
matter saying they're getting pressure

252
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,380
from authorities so during this whole

253
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,200
time going from you know 2020 all the

254
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
way through 2021 and into 2023 there

255
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,860
have been very uh distinct points where

256
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,540
this particular group has found

257
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,880
themselves in the spotlight

258
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,740
and when they did that they went through

259
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,240
a Rebrand

260
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,760
now when they did this uh the first time

261
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,740
they actually did a Rebrand from Dark

262
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,200
Side to black matter at that lasted or

263
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,720
that Rebrand took less than 60 days

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,040
they obviously learned a little bit

265
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,300
because the next time they went through

266
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,300
a Rebrand they didn't less than 30. now

267
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,459
as you like basically from these numbers

268
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,320
you can see that the overall level of

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,600
effort is going down and the reward

270
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,180
definitely pays off this group was able

271
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,040
to extend their operations for over 400

272
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,019
Days and every day that Alpha is active

273
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,660
now moving forward it's just another day

274
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,040
that they've extended their operations

275
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560
so from this perspective you can see how

276
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,380
effective it was to actually Rebrand to

277
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,620
a couple of different groups here

278
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,839
another really great example is going to

279
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,760
be evil core so I'm sure we've all heard

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,560
of evil Corp we've all

281
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,880
um you know experienced intelligence

282
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
related to evil core they started their

283
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,860
ransomware operations with bitpaymer and

284
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,180
they were active for several years

285
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,700
before they started to really get put on

286
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,500
things like sanctioned lists and and

287
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
started getting a lot of heat from you

288
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,480
know the intelligence Community uh and

289
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,560
then that's when they start going

290
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,779
through their rebranding process so they

291
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,640
went through wasted Locker Hades Phoenix

292
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,580
Locker payload Ben McCall locker and all

293
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,500
of these had a different

294
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,820
um period of time that they were active

295
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,100
but what you can see is that they got so

296
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,540
good at rebranding that they were able

297
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,899
to put out a new rebranded ransomware in

298
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,000
about 21 days which is consistent with

299
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,519
the data that we saw with some of our

300
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,720
ephemeral

301
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
Rebrand data from 2022.

302
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,720
so what's interesting about how evil

303
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,339
Corp did some of their operations with

304
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,040
was that there is some overlapping from

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
when they were going through different

306
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,860
rebrands

307
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,040
um as and as time went on the rebrands

308
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
became much more quick or shorter in

309
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,720
duration just showing again how

310
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,560
effective some of these operations are

311
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,180
now especially towards the end when we

312
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,459
got to McCall Locker

313
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,200
um they were already on the sanctions

314
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
list of U.S treasury so you couldn't

315
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,700
actually pay them the hope I think from

316
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,860
their perspective was if we can Rebrand

317
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,959
fast enough we can start getting our

318
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,339
rants more out there we can actually

319
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,320
receive payments before anybody realizes

320
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,800
that we uh that McCall Locker was a part

321
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,519
of the evil Corp tool said and so this

322
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,980
is another example where the average

323
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,800
Rebrand duration was about 38 days got

324
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,079
way shorter during the end but again we

325
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,579
extend they extended their operations

326
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,399
for over 400 Days which is huge when you

327
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,019
think about how much money a lot of

328
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,519
these ransomware groups are making at

329
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,339
any given time for any one Ransom and

330
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,079
even more when you factor in the the

331
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,000
double extortion aspects of this

332
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,940
so knowing that rebrands are a thing and

333
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,860
knowing that they're so effective well

334
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,839
what are the tips and tricks and and how

335
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,640
can we use these tips and tricks to make

336
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,440
sure that we are effective at

337
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,680
identifying grants more rebranding

338
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,480
the first thing to start with here and

339
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,079
this is the best example of identifying

340
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,720
um you know technical information and

341
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,519
concrete facts and evidence to identify

342
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,079
ransomware rebranding this was a report

343
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,940
by Sentinel Labs

344
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,740
um it's the best example that I've seen

345
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,560
to date of actually

346
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,620
confirming and factually based evidence

347
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,140
for identifying rebranding and so a lot

348
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,519
of what we're doing when we're spotting

349
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,339
these rebrands is how are they doing

350
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,560
certain things how are they doing file

351
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,180
and drive enumeration how are they

352
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,160
proceeding with encryption how are they

353
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,500
doing API hashing or import routines any

354
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,579
number of different pieces of

355
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,560
functionality that you would see in

356
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,380
ransomware if we can start to identify

357
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,760
things

358
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
you know in styles that individual

359
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,380
developers are doing that's one thing

360
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,959
that we can then take and Implement so

361
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,320
that we can identify that same type of

362
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,740
style in other ransomwares now for all

363
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
of you guys who who um remember the 90s

364
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,540
there was a movie called blank check and

365
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,360
that's where that little uh get or that

366
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,579
little meme came in at the end so one of

367
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,440
my favorite movies and wish that I could

368
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,440
do it when I was a kid but anyway

369
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,180
um so big thing here is just continuing

370
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,000
to identify ways to identify these

371
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,500
ransomware rebrands so one of the big

372
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,480
things that we can do is in-depth code

373
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,839
analysis so especially when we see uh

374
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,339
source code that's like for instance on

375
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,959
the right hand side we have Conti's

376
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,700
source code that was leaked we can

377
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
actually take some of that and we can

378
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,720
then identify key components of what

379
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,339
happened in or what's being used in that

380
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,560
code how it's done the style that's

381
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,600
associated with it and we can put that

382
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,839
in our Arsenal to be able to detect that

383
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,820
being used in other samples

384
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,700
on the left hand side we could use

385
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,980
certain tools like bindiff to look at

386
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,380
routines that exist in one sample but

387
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,600
maybe don't exist in another or they

388
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
definitely exist in both and that's how

389
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,079
we can start looking for that code reuse

390
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,940
we can start making sure that we're

391
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,300
tracking these things and identifying

392
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,339
when these types of these pieces of code

393
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,019
are used from sample to sample again

394
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,660
looking at trying to identify that in

395
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,060
other variants

396
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,220
one thing to keep in mind here is that

397
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,920
leak sites are code two there is HTML

398
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,420
code that's associated with developing

399
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,519
these leak sites and if we can start

400
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,639
identifying the similar types of code

401
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
used and leak sites that's another way

402
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,019
that we can we can detect

403
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,519
um when certain groups are going through

404
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,899
a Rebrand process so that's just

405
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,600
something to keep in mind

406
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,579
and so you know this is something that I

407
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,959
think the last talk covered really well

408
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,660
but I think the big thing here is as we

409
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,399
go through all of these different

410
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,139
components right we're looking at code

411
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,480
we're looking at leak sites let's make

412
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,699
sure we're making this work for us so

413
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,440
whether it's Yara whether it's figuring

414
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,000
out how to contribute to aluminum

415
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,519
whether that's adding signatures into

416
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,500
your different sandboxes or other

417
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,600
routines for ghidra however we're doing

418
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,579
this we just have to make sure that all

419
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,860
this information that we're Gathering

420
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,860
is being put to work and that's you know

421
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,420
one of the biggest components for how

422
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,339
we're going to build these long-term

423
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,620
capabilities to identify when rebranding

424
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,040
is happening

425
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,600
the last thing here really for for tips

426
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,519
and tricks is we need to start profiling

427
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,800
behaviors so as much as there's Behavior

428
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,139
there's style and how developers are

429
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,120
creating things and the fact that many

430
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,339
developers including myself are lazy and

431
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,079
we want to reuse code whenever we

432
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,959
possibly can because it's faster we just

433
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,160
want to make sure that we're profiling

434
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,420
the behaviors

435
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,760
so whether it's ttps in terms of initial

436
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,279
intrusion or post-exploitation

437
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,779
um you know that's something we need to

438
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,480
keep track of negotiation tactics one of

439
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,000
the things that my team does is put

440
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
active negotiations and so figuring out

441
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
what kind of negotiation tactics do

442
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,820
these groups use may be very helpful in

443
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,279
defining their their profile

444
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,320
um any kind of dark web identities how

445
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,820
they communicate

446
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,680
going through how they go through

447
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,420
rebrands you know getting into tracking

448
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,040
that long term

449
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,079
um any kind of financial behaviors or

450
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,880
relationships with other e-crime groups

451
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,980
these are all important things that we

452
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,320
want to add to a living threat profile

453
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,660
so a lot of times the tendency is

454
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,940
develop this profile and it's going to

455
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,339
serve us now and in the future but the

456
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,620
unfortunate reality is threat actors are

457
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,320
move fast they change fast and so we

458
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,759
need to keep up with this we need to

459
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,380
have a living threat profile that

460
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,839
develops as these threat actors develop

461
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,259
themselves

462
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,860
the one thing I want to take a step back

463
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,800
on here and talk about is just some of

464
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,480
the pitfalls and so we have to watch out

465
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,759
because there is an entire ecosystem

466
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
that that Services Ransom more groups

467
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,040
and it's it's quite large so

468
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,839
it's a tendency when we see something

469
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,240
right out of the gate to have

470
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,740
um you know quick attribution we want to

471
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,780
we want to tie that to a group we want

472
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,819
to say hey it was you know something we

473
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,619
saw is definitely locked in and we want

474
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,839
to do that quickly and move forward but

475
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,119
there is a difference between the actual

476
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,640
Core group of developers and some of the

477
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,099
Affiliates right and so there's some of

478
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,079
this extension where media and others

479
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,579
are going to want to really provide that

480
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,679
attribution quickly we kind of have to

481
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,179
take a step back especially because

482
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,620
ransomware as a service really

483
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,200
complicates things

484
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,940
um Outsourcing is a real thing a lot of

485
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,160
these threat actors want to use

486
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,419
um some of the the quickest and best

487
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,100
ways to get the functionality they need

488
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,780
and so when you look at something like

489
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,600
code reuse between lockbit 3 and black

490
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,580
matter clearly there's something going

491
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,559
on there that we need to incorporate

492
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,360
into our intelligence to make sure we

493
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,039
understand what's going on there and not

494
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,559
jump to a conclusion and say hey lock

495
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,600
bit three and black matter are the same

496
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,880
group

497
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,760
um another thing is more groups have

498
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,559
leaks I think Conti is a great example

499
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,419
of this they went through a huge leak

500
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,340
which probably forced most of their

501
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,520
Rebrand to actually occur and so their

502
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,960
playbooks were released their Source

503
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,660
quotas was released so we need to make

504
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,980
sure we don't have a tendency to just

505
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,679
step back and say hey I saw this

506
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,539
Playbook it's used by a different group

507
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,700
you know that must be Conti well we have

508
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,960
to we have to really put it through its

509
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,700
Paces here and say is that something

510
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,980
that's a little bit more widespread or

511
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,840
is it truly something that is defined by

512
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,120
that group

513
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,740
um large groups have options there's

514
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,299
just a lot of stuff going on with how

515
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,500
they operate they have a lot of

516
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,660
relationships of their own so really

517
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,880
what I'm what this means is it does make

518
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
it a lot harder for us on the blue team

519
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,000
side of things on the intelligence side

520
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,080
of things

521
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,520
um but this is where we have to make a

522
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,080
lot of this data work for us we need to

523
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,419
have long-term trends use our data to

524
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,100
really establish

525
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,640
um you know these rebranding activities

526
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,440
and so what is the point of all this

527
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,160
really we want to take happy hacker

528
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,380
and make them into sad hacker

529
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,700
we want to make them Rebrand so often we

530
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,679
want to make sure we force their hands

531
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,039
so often that it no longer becomes a a

532
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,200
very

533
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,080
monetizable strategy to just Rebrand so

534
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,640
if we can force them to have to go

535
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,080
through that process over and over again

536
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,820
eventually they're going to start losing

537
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,320
money and that's exactly what we're

538
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,100
looking to do here

539
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,320
and so with all of this what what do we

540
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,760
do now

541
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,760
the first thing is communicating what I

542
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,799
call the single source of Truth so we

543
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,679
have threat intelligence as part of a

544
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,200
bigger cyber security group or a fusion

545
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,240
Center or however your organization

546
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,220
looks at it but the biggest thing we

547
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,660
need to do is all of this intelligence

548
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,520
that's coming in all this research from

549
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,059
various organizations we want to make

550
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,400
sure that we're communicating this if

551
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,140
we're not communicating this in groups

552
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,720
like The Sock can't take any action or

553
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,360
Executives can't properly Define risk

554
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,340
then we're not doing something right

555
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,100
with our program and our capabilities

556
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,140
so when we are disseminating this

557
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,419
intelligence we need to focus on a

558
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,280
couple of key characteristics we want it

559
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
to be something that can be consumed and

560
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,799
we want it to be actionable if they're

561
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,360
not able to consume the intelligence

562
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,220
you're providing and they can't take any

563
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,840
action on it then I don't think that

564
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,480
you're actually providing intelligence

565
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,039
we want to make sure that that

566
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,480
intelligence is also highly

567
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,820
contextualized so if you're providing

568
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,380
something that's not relevant to your

569
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,120
industry or not relevant to your

570
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,460
organization it's likely that it's just

571
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,760
not relevant and able to be used by the

572
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,039
various teams that are going to be

573
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,260
benefiting from your intelligence

574
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,200
so again making sure that it's relevant

575
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,240
focusing on your industry focusing on

576
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,460
your organization making sure that they

577
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,679
also get that in a timely manner if

578
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:53,820
they're getting threat intelligence

579
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,980
that's a month old obviously that's not

580
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,419
very actionable and they're not getting

581
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,039
that in a way that's going to be

582
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,320
beneficial to the team

583
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,240
um another thing is is rate limiting

584
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,160
right so you have to understand the

585
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,380
context of your organization if you have

586
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,840
a three-person sock they're not going to

587
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,299
be able to consume thousands of threat

588
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,100
intelligence alerts or you know

589
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,539
thousands of their intelligence bull

590
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,460
bulletins you have to make sure that

591
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,960
you're providing a rate of intelligence

592
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,660
that your organization can sustain

593
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,580
and lastly you want to make sure that

594
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,200
it's easily understood

595
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,539
so again you know they want to in order

596
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,760
for it to be consumable and so that and

597
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,380
for them to be able to take actions on

598
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,240
it you need to make sure that it is

599
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,400
something that can be uh analyzed and

600
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,020
understood very quickly

601
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,659
so another key component of how we make

602
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,340
this intelligence work for us is we

603
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,320
incorporate our intelligence that we're

604
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
creating into threat modeling and then

605
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,240
when you have a threat model for the

606
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,280
organ or the ransomware groups that are

607
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,140
likely to more Target your organization

608
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,960
or industry vertical then you have that

609
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,179
informed threat hunting

610
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,080
um obviously there's a whole other

611
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,000
component here that is going to be built

612
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,679
into making sure that there's proactive

613
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,720
alerting and that was basically you know

614
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
the a lot of the message from the

615
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,220
previous talk but really making sure

616
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,559
that you're going through and informing

617
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,179
all the different hunts that you

618
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,520
possibly could as a proactive measure is

619
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,780
going to be extremely important

620
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,840
and so kind of lastly throwing throwing

621
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,460
everything together here one of the

622
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,740
biggest calls to action that I have been

623
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,200
focusing on with my team over the last

624
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
two years has been threat intelligent

625
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,360
sharing and I think that overall we do a

626
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,640
pretty good job of threat intelligent

627
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,140
sharing as an industry you know we do

628
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,880
get iocs out there there's a lot of

629
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,799
really great Twitter

630
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,240
um Twitter accounts that are sharing

631
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,280
Intelligence on a regular basis and and

632
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,860
providing those up-to-date ilcs and I

633
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,940
think that's great

634
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,320
but I think we could take it a step

635
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,179
further and I think we could share

636
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,880
threat profiles between groups between

637
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,919
individuals so that we are actually

638
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,780
keeping everybody up to date

639
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,159
I think we could share tools and

640
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,720
techniques whether that's a

641
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,520
configuration extractor for a ransomware

642
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,340
uh binary or it's some way of making

643
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,039
sure that we're tracking or or ways of

644
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,780
extracting other ilcs and information

645
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,960
from specific ransomware variants in

646
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,760
families

647
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,679
sharing that emerging Trends and and

648
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,380
research I think is also a really big

649
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,000
component of making sure that we're

650
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,940
staying and keeping everybody up to date

651
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,580
um a big thing here right is we want to

652
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,260
make it difficult for the threat actors

653
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,299
and in order for us to do this we have

654
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,799
to share information even better and

655
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,419
intelligence even better

656
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,659
so data sets huge you know additionally

657
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,240
analysis nodes there's a lot of really

658
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,580
complex routines that a lot of threat

659
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,740
actors create in their samples and

660
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,059
there's a lot of really brilliant people

661
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,860
that are analyzing these malware samples

662
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,840
on a regular basis and they are

663
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,539
extracting out the methodology and

664
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,760
intelligence from these samples but a

665
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,860
lot of times it stays within the the

666
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,840
organization that that analyst works for

667
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,419
I think there's a huge opportunity for

668
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,760
us to get in and start sharing these

669
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,220
types of notes so that when this is seen

670
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,720
by a different group they're able to

671
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,840
move fast and actually establish some of

672
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,419
the different indicators and and some of

673
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,179
the different behaviors that are being

674
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,980
seen by other groups

675
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,720
so at the end of the day you know what

676
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm really going for here is share

677
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,640
everything I would much rather seem more

678
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,159
transparency between intelligence

679
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,140
working groups between organizations and

680
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,760
individuals

681
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,559
um and ultimately again and I've hit on

682
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,240
this a couple of different times we have

683
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,280
to make it harder for these threat

684
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,140
actors to go through a Rebrand they have

685
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,580
to make it harder for them to make

686
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,860
slight changes to their ransomware and

687
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,659
then continue operating

688
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,100
so really again let's just start sharing

689
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,380
um I'll I'll put all the call I'll throw

690
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,539
the call to action out there and say my

691
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,640
organization is ready to start sharing

692
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,679
more if you guys want to share more with

693
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,960
us please get into contact with us we

694
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,480
would love to do that and I hope that by

695
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,980
showing how valuable some of this

696
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,659
intelligence sharing could be that more

697
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,520
organizations more individuals will all

698
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,740
take part in providing threat

699
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,240
intelligence to the community

700
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,340
so that's what I had for today

701
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,320
um I want to thank you for your time and

702

703
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,910
