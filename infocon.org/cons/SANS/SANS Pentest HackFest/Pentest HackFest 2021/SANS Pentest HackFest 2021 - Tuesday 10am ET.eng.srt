yesterday about um

20
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
getting offensive of management getting

21
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,440
really management and uh you know

22
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,800
leverage some of the data and knowledge

23
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,479
that we have in order to convince your

24
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
managers of you know the steps they need

25
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
to take with their security teams it was

26
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
very informative but what i'd like to

27
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
really ask is tim do you get offensive

28
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
with management

29
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,120
well of course

30
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,000
i mean

31
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
as you can see that was aggressive but

32
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,919
yes

33
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
physically

34
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,280
but

35
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,759
part of part of his message is around

36
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,360
i think one of the key things i think of

37
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,319
it is the managing up down and side

38
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,720
and so that from that perspective

39
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
i try my best but of course bryce

40
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
doesn't have to give the official word

41
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,400
on whether whether it's it's making it

42
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
all the way up to

43
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
our top management

44
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
this is probably the time to share uh

45
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
how tim was talking about management

46
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,919
after three drinks in the bar yesterday

47
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,440
it's a perfect time yeah so if you

48
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,759
haven't seen the keynote the idea behind

49
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,960
it with getting offensive with

50
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
management and uh you dressed up as the

51
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
lieutenant explorer of the third site

52
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,560
unicorn ears was the fact that we often

53
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,280
go to these conferences and we see all

54
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,599
of these really cool techniques

55
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,759
and then we have to go back to our jobs

56
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,199
we don't get to do

57
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,680
right and we're nerds we like to do cool

58
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
stuff and so what i tried to do was

59
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
talk about the personal psychology the

60
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
organizational management and then also

61
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
a different way to even do and look at

62
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,960
the technical processes so we get to do

63
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
that fun stuff and really make a

64
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,680
difference that's great and um so coming

65
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,039
a little bit from the other side i'll

66
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,479
mention so bryson you're quite an

67
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,560
influencer in our community um but you

68
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,720
take that

69
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
because you have a lot of experience

70
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,080
with this do you have any sort of

71
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,599
practical advice to give those that are

72
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,680
maybe um i don't know younger or older

73
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
in the field have less experience more

74
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,479
experience who want to start their own

75
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,960
businesses and want to you know maybe

76
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
it's just consultant work or maybe it is

77
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
you know a start starting to establish

78
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
some sort of product uh you mentioned in

79
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,640
your talk about that you always cite

80
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
resources in all your slides so that

81
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,919
they're available for everyone to look

82
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,719
at

83
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,240
is there any resources you want to plug

84
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
with regard to business development or

85
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,920
starting your own business yeah

86
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
coincidentally i just gave that talk at

87
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,839
the north texas issa summit

88
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,000
unfortunately it was not recorded

89
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
however um if you look up my name bryson

90
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
vort and then um i've done several talks

91
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
called my title entrepreneurial

92
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,640
adventures uh probably the biggest one

93
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
was at the career hacking village back

94
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
at defcon 28. and what i talk through is

95
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,320
all of the elements from first of all

96
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
why would you do this yourself like why

97
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,880
would you start a business because

98
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,160
it's not

99
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
money you can't start this for the money

100
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
so there are two key qualities to look

101
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,560
at yourself as an entrepreneur for

102
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,000
starting your own business

103
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,519
one is passion

104
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,600
you have to want to do something so

105
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
badly that each moment that it is not

106
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
out there in the world it bothers you

107
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,279
right and if that's a product that's

108
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,839
obvious but if it's a consultancy it's

109
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,480
oftentimes going to the people aspect of

110
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,440
how we take care of people and wanting

111
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
to do that yourself because we've all

112
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,320
had bad bosses right we all have people

113
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,200
who don't treat us well and so you doing

114
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,560
that on your own

115
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
is that that element of starting your

116
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,519
business and doing it your way for

117
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,120
consultancy

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,880
the second key attribute to an

119
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,320
entrepreneur is tolerance for bs

120
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
it's your own business there is nobody

121
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
can look to and be like oh this sucks

122
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,079
can you

123
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
there's no one behind you to do it you

124
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,839
have to do it and you are going to have

125
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
to learn things like what are the health

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,640
insurance requirements in north dakota

127
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,120
how can you hire somebody in colorado

128
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,200
all of these different aspects the

129
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
administrivia that booking business are

130
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
yours

131

so i talk through the ideation i talk

132
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
about the networking aspect i talk about

133
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,120

134
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
business and the unit of economics

135
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
between products and services and of

136
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
so glad to hear you enjoyed the purple

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
team workshops one of the big pieces of

171
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,839
feedback we've gotten is people want

172
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,000
more they want to dive deeper and so

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,240
with that and with our series a we've

174
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
been able to hire a couple of extra

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,040
unicorns to bring that content to

176
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,399
everyone so part of what we're going to

177
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
be doing is uh

178
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
breaking it up a little bit so that we

179
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
have for instance a detection

180
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
engineering workshop something that

181
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,279
bryson talked about this keynote today

182
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
is that process of how you do purple

183
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,279
teaming and so breaking it up into

184
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
things like detection engineering uh

185
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,839
additionally how do we dive into making

186
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
our tests a little bit more difficult as

187
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,000
our organization matures those types of

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,560
things are additional workshops that be

189
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,399
on the lookout for the same as our

190
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
current workshop will be free they'll be

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
open to the community there will be a

192
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,240
hands-on lab so that everybody can learn

193
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,639
in addition to uh and trying to

194
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,800
reinforce some of those concepts

195
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
so that's that's what you've got coming

196
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,279
up for me and uh so look out for those

197
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,600
and again uh i have to hear feedback

198
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
about what people like about them and

199
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,480
what they want to see because that's

200
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
what's driving us going forward i'll

201
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,079
just mention about the workshop very low

202
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,600
barrier to entry

203
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,519
really very easy to take part in it you

204
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,200
know it operated quite seamlessly

205
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
they're very cool check them out if you

206
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
have not and they're free

207
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,279
the best price is free so they're

208
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
offered every single month right now

209
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,680
check them out on our website

210
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,440
and be offering even more like smaller

211
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
pieces with webinars and then

212
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
specialized workshops so you can deep

213
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
dive beyond just that hey i've been

214
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
introduced to this overall process now i

215
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
really want to go into that or let's

216
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,920
evaluate those different areas that's

217
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,440
what we're doing um unicon is our annual

218
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
conference with site

219
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,279
obviously playoff unicorn unicon we're

220
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
never subtle

221
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,600
and what it is is the purple team

222
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
practitioner conference we're trying to

223
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,600
bring practitioners from the real world

224
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
that are innovating process and

225
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,240
technologies different tools some free

226
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,000
some that are out there that uh you know

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
our paid service um so that folks can

228
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,639
see what's the latest thing that's

229
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,959
actually happening out there i mean we

230
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,120
joked about the influencer thing but

231
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,199
the the knock on influencers is it's

232
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,639
just ideas

233
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,279
and it is don't matter if they can't

234
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,760
inspire action and so the idea behind

235
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,240
unicon is we're trying to share what is

236
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
the act that's happening out in the

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,839
community so that others can see that

238
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,600
instead of having somebody who clearly

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,839
has an agenda talking about it hear from

240
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,680
a practitioner that's out there right

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
there in the trenches with you who's

242
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,399
doing it too

243
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,079
um

244
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,240
yeah i'm not sure what else to

245
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,680
get something else in there

246
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,959
that was great that was perfect that's

247
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,279
exactly what i was hoping we would cover

248
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
