1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,279
all right i'm super excited to have

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,360
crane join us today we reached out to

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
him specifically because of his

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,080
expertise and business email compromise

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,279
what is it and what should we teach

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,480
bec is the silent killer of the internet

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
we're all hearing about ransom because

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,880
it's always in the news because if you

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,519
get hacked by ransom where you're going

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,760
to be in the news but it's estimated

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,159
organizations only lost about 500

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,120
million in ransomware last year it may

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,079
be 500 million 700 million in ransomware

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,120
this year as crane is about to show you

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,239
when it comes to bec attacks and fraud

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,200
we don't deal in millions we deal in

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,680
billions and this is purely 100

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,480
human-based attack and primarily one of

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
the only ways you can stop this

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
is through the human so i felt it was

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,960
very important for you to better

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,760
understand this risk so you can better

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
manage this risk

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,720
crane

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,080
you're on

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
all right thanks lance um with that out

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
of the way um so again my name is crain

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,080
household i'm the director of threat

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,320
intelligence at abnormal security really

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
excited to talk about

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,799
um

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,640
uh you know what we've seen in the bec

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
threat landscape over the past couple of

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
years and really as science mentioned

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
how bec has really

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,119
transformed into the primary threat that

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,119
most businesses all around the world are

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,680
are focused on this year

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
now i've got a lot of stuff to talk

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
about here but first i really want to

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,759
level set on the problem of business

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,000
email compromise and not just look at

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
the scope and how big it has become but

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
also understand why it's actually

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
happened why it has become such a big

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
issue

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,799
now before we you know get into

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,399
that problem let's let's

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,920
throw down some definitions so we can

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
all be on the same page about what we're

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
actually talking about when we talk

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,600
about bec because it's one of those

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
terms that really has fallen into this

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
very nebulous definition and a lot of

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,878
people mean a lot of different things

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
when they're talking about bec now the

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,640
definition that i primarily use when i'm

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,160
talking about business email compromise

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
is it's going to be a targeted spear

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
phishing attack

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
that involves the impersonation of a

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,920
trusted individual or someone that a

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,239
target knows in order to trick that

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,959
person into making a making a financial

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
transaction or sending sensitive

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
materials

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,160
generally speaking that's what we're

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,599
talking about when we're talking about

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,440
business email compromise and there are

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
two primary ways that this can actually

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
happen one is through

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,000
spoofing either the display name you

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
know looking looking at who it's coming

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
from or the email address usually those

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
are done in conjunction with one another

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,760
or it could be done through the actual

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,239
compromise of an email account which has

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,280
become more

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
prominent more recently which we'll talk

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,879
about here in a bit

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
but using a compromised account to

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
actually send the messages

83
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
one of the things that's really

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
important to keep in mind and i'll

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,360
probably i'll mention this a couple of

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
times as we go through this presentation

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
is when we're talking about business

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
email compromise we're generally talking

89
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,400
about a simple response based attack

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
that doesn't include a phishing link

91
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,959
that does not include a malicious

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
payload it's simply a text-based attack

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
that's trying to get a person to respond

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
to it

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,680
now

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
you know lance that's uh you know

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
attributed to this a little earlier but

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
let's look at the the numbers of the

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,000
actual losses that are attributed to bec

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
and all of these numbers are coming from

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,799
primarily from the fbi's internet crime

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,200
complaint center or or ic3

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
and one of the one of the best alerts

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,760
that the that ic3 put out was in late

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
2019 and in that um in that alert ic3

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
said that between june of 2016 and

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,319
october of 2019 more than 26 billion

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
dollars had been lost to

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
the bec attacks globally and when you

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,640
put that on a per month basis that's

111
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,959
about 708 million dollars that's being

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,080
lost every single month and that was at

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
this point about a year and a half two

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
years ago and we know that bec losses

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
have only grown since then

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
the amount that's lost per bec attack is

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,918
about 96 000 and that does vary

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,280
depending on the type of attack which

119
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,199
we'll talk about here in a few minutes

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
and then what's also really fascinating

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,120
is when you look at the most recent ic3

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,199
report that came out earlier this year

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,840
and you look at the comparisons of all

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
of the different types of cyber crime

125
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,400
that businesses are seeing on a on a

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,919
daily basis

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,040
bec

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
actually adds up to about 41

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
of all cyber crime losses that

130
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
organizations are seeing

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
and when you compare that to other types

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
of cyber crime activity ransomware is a

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
great example of that

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
it's not even close that bec is the

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
biggest financial

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,360
uh

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,280
the biggest cause of financial loss out

138
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
there

139
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,600
so why has bec become such a big problem

140
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
well my my opinion there are three

141
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
primary reasons that bec has become such

142
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,360
a the the issue that it is today

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
the first is that traditional email

144
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
defenses that have now been around for

145
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,560
decades have primarily focused on

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
technically sophisticated threats

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
they're been focused on things like

148
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
ransomware or other types of malware or

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
even credential phishing

150
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
and the cyber criminals have actually

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
identified this and they've noticed this

152
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
and what they've done is they've pivoted

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,759
their tactics and moved to less

154
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,240
technically sophisticated techniques

155
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
moving to more pure social engineering

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,400
instead of using malicious payloads or

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,080
malicious links

158
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
and so they're they they've sort of

159
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
adapted to the improved defenses that as

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,960
a community we have we've gotten to

161
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,199
the second reason is if you think of

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,000
cyber crime from the the perspective of

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
a business

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
um and in most cyber crime is a business

165
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,319
because it's financially motivated

166
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
from a from for bec it has a much higher

167
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,360
return on investment than other types of

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
cyber attacks you know one of the things

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,880
that you know i've been saying for a

170
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,039
number of years was you know at some

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,880
point the eastern european and the

172
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
russian cyber criminals that have you

173
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
know historically been known for more

174
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
technically sophisticated cyber attacks

175
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,840
are gonna start thinking to themselves

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,639
you know

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,120
why am i spending all of this time and

178
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,360
resources and money you know setting up

179
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,520
infrastructure for my malware or hiring

180
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
developers for my malware when i can

181
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
just send someone an email

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
ask them to send me money and they'll do

183
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,639
it

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
the overhead there is so much lower and

185
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,319
the amount of profit that they can make

186
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,720
from a bec attack is so much higher

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
that i think

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
we started seeing more sophisticated

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,759
actors moving into the bec space in

190
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,280
recent years and i think it's going to

191
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,160
continue that's going to continue moving

192
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
increasing moving forward

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
and then the final reason bec has become

194
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
such a problem is

195
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
at the end of the day

196
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
social engineering is extremely

197
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,440
effective as long as human beings have

198
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,199
been on this planet and we've been

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,199
interacting with one another we've been

200
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
social engineering each other the only

201
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
difference is today we're doing it

202
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
through email through a computer instead

203
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,280
of doing it face to face or over the

204
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
phone or through the mail

205
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
the same concepts that have been used

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,599
literally for thousands of years to con

207
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
each other are still being used today in

208
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,160
bec attacks and other types of scams

209
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,800
and so that's you know a very brief

210
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
overview of you know why you know how

211
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
big of a problem bc has become

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
over the past five to six years and why

213
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
it's become such a big problem so next i

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
want to sort of pivot into looking at

215
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,080
the the various flavors of bec and what

216
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,919
types of bec attacks that we're seeing

217
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,479
on a regular basis

218
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,680
now the first one is uh it are our wire

219
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
transfer attacks now these wire transfer

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
attacks this is really where bec

221
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
you know uh uh uh started with back in

222
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
about 2014 2015

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
basic ceo impersonation scam someone

224
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
trying to you know impersonating the

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
executive at a company

226
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
and is saying you know can you please

227
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
send a a wire transfer to this vendor

228
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,160
that there's there's a there's a payment

229
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,280
that's overdue

230
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,599
this is where bc has come from still

231
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,319
about 20 or so of all the bec attacks we

232
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,120
see on a regular basis are requesting

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
wire transfers to a fictitious vendor

234
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
now the upsides to these from the cyber

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
criminals perspective is the payouts are

236
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,799
generally significantly higher you know

237
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
the average amount for these wire

238
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,559
transfer requests is between usually

239
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,200
between 50 and 60 000 as you'll see here

240
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
on a couple of slides that could

241
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
depending on that type of wire transfer

242
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
request that could be significantly

243
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
higher but on average it's about 50 to

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
60 000

245
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,279
and then also what we'll see and we'll

246
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,440
see this more on the next slide is when

247
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
we talk about these types of requests

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
the threat actors can actually develop

249
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
some pretty sophisticated pretexts and

250
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
reasons why um these payments need to be

251
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
made

252
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,279
now the downside of this if you look at

253
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,240
this from the cyber criminals

254
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
perspective you know the payouts while

255
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
they may be higher they're actually they

256
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
take a lot more time to actually go

257
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,040
through in order to get the money from

258
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,680
point a which is the target organization

259
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
to point b which is the scammer it needs

260
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,200
to go through multiple different

261
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
channels it needs to get wired to a bank

262
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
account from that bank from that mule

263
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
account it actually needs to go to

264
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
generally through a number of different

265
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
hops that where you're also going to be

266
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,519
losing money along the way before it

267
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,320
eventually gets back to the scammer and

268
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,880
it also requires those money mules

269
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
it requires a generally a third person

270
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
that is going to be receiving and

271
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,519
passing on the money uh that other types

272
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
of bez attacks don't require and you'll

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
see here in just a second what those

274
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
types of attacks are

275
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
now this is one of the more

276
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,240
sophisticated pretexts that we've uh

277
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
that we've seen more recently and what

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,600
we've seen is some of these

279
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
sophisticated actors that are places

280
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
like eastern europe or russia or even

281
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
israel where israel is one of the places

282
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,480
where we're seeing a really emerging

283
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,279
hotspot for bec actors

284
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,320
we see

285
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
these more sophisticated pretexts in

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
this case it's a it's an actor that is

287
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
first impersonating the ceo of a company

288
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,160
and saying that there is a really

289
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
important uh confidential payment that

290
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,480
needs to be done and

291
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,399
what they what this actor does is they

292
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,200
use one persona and then pass the target

293
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,519
employee off to a secondary persona

294
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,680
that's actually uh impersonating a

295
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
legitimate uh attorney in places like

296
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
western europe and that that second

297
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,480
persona is the one that's actually going

298
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,519
to be

299
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,880
working on the the actual payments

300
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
and so this is an example of some of

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
these sophisticated pretexts that we've

302
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,040
started seeing over the past couple of

303
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
years that the

304
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
that bec actors are able to do with wire

305
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,640
transfer requests

306
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,000
another type of bec attack that's really

307
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,680
undergone some really significant

308
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
transformations over the past year and a

309
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
half to two years is payroll diversion

310
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760
and in these attacks it's essentially a

311
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,120
bc actor that's going to be

312
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
impersonating an employee at a company

313
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,079
usually going to be a c-level executive

314
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,240
who's uh who's going to be contacting

315
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
someone on the human resources team to

316
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,040
say you know i've just changed my uh my

317
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,279
bank account i need to update my direct

318
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,720
deposit information can i just give you

319
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,920
the information can i give you the

320
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,839
account details and see if you can make

321
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,240
the account the change on my end

322
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
and so that's sort of the concept behind

323
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
these attacks over the past year and a

324
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,360
half

325
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,079
this has gone through a significant

326
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,959
decline to the point of in july of last

327
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,000
year

328
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
only about three percent of all of the

329
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,959
btc attacks that we were seeing on a on

330
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,240
a monthly basis

331
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,440
during that month were actually

332
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
requesting payroll payroll uh diversions

333
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,639
whereas now since the middle of last

334
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,240
year we've seen an almost consistent

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,360
month-over-month increase um as actors

336
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
have actually moved to the types of

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,880
accounts that are being used to receive

338
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
these funds

339
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,360
and a month over month now about 25 of

340
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
all of the bec attacks we see on a

341
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
monthly basis are now requesting uh

342
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
payroll changes

343
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
and you know one of the some of the

344
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
upsides to these are

345
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,399
the detection of for these attacks is

346
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,519
actually usually delayed if you think

347
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,040
about it you're usually getting paid

348
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
once every two weeks

349
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
and so that is if i'm not receiving my

350
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
my paycheck right away i might not

351
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,800
realize that and so there may be a

352
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,279
little bit of a lag time between the

353
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,920
time that the the the money is actually

354
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
sent into a mule account in the time

355
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,399
it's actually identified by the employee

356
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,800
who's missing the money and that delayed

357
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,760
detection uh increases the success rate

358
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,959
that the money will be able to get

359
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,120
passed on to the scammer without being

360
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,320
retrieved by by a financial institution

361
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,959
and then the other upside to it is a lot

362
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,720
of the the payroll diversion activity

363
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
that we see today is driven by prepaid

364
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
cards these are cards that you can pick

365
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,079
up at many big box stores like a walmart

366
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,360
and these are cards that are ex that are

367
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
generally going to be marketed to

368
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
receiving direct deposits or other types

369
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
of unempl of uh government benefits

370
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
and these cards because they're easier

371
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,560
to set up um and in some cases they can

372
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
be set up online only without actually

373
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
having to purchase the actual card um it

374
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
becomes it because it gets a little bit

375
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
more attractive

376
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
for scammers

377
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,000
now the downsides to these obviously in

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
most cases there's an unknown amount

379
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
they don't know how much the employees

380
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,360
are actually making so don't know how

381
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
much they're actually supposed to be

382
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,519
getting in

383
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
generally speaking though as i mentioned

384
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,199
they're going to be targeting executives

385
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,519
so the thought process there is that

386
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
there's going to be a a larger dollar

387
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,600
amount than than

388
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
trying to impersonate some other

389
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,880
employee at a company

390
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
and the targets are are very limited

391
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,600
obviously the p the number of employees

392
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
at a company that i can actually change

393
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,279
and have control over someone's direct

394
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
deposit account is very limited and so

395
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,680
those are really the only employees that

396
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,519
would be the the targets for these types

397
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,000
of attacks

398
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,839
so the third type of bc attack which is

399
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,320
you know has become significant has

400
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
increased significantly over the past

401
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
couple of years are

402
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
bec attacks that are requesting gift

403
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,079
cards as a form of payment and you can

404
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,000
see an example of one of these on the

405
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
right-hand side of the screen um

406
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
generally these are going to be

407
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
attacks that are going to be

408
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,199
impersonating either the ceo or

409
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,720
executive at a company or even an

410
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
employee's supervisor

411
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
saying that you know i'm looking to get

412
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,560
uh some to get some gift cards for

413
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,680
either rewards for employees or gifts

414
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,000
for potential customers can you go out

415
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and buy a thousand to fifteen hundred

416
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,079
dollars of these of certain types of

417
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,639
gift cards and and you take pictures of

418
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,399
them and send them to me right

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,720
and what's really interesting here the

420
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,360
reason these have become so popular is

421
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,839
one they're usually not reversible once

422
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,279
they've been sent to the scammer they

423
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,320
are laundered extremely fast you know

424
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,079
with we've seen you know i've done some

425
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,399
research where looking at the time when

426
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,519
these

427
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
even like two thousand dollars of you

428
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
know 100 apple itunes gift cards are

429
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,600
sent to a scammer and those are

430
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,680
individually laundered uh they're

431
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,920
generally going to be posted for sale on

432
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,440
online peer-to-peer cryptocurrency

433
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
exchanges and they go from the time they

434
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,760
receive the first ones received by the

435
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
scammer to the time that that those

436
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
cards are laundered and hit the scammers

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,839
bank account can be as little as about

438
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
two hours and so that is a very very

439
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,600
fast process um it also doesn't doesn't

440
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,360
require a middleman

441
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
or a money mule in order to facilitate

442
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
these transactions the the pictures of

443
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
the gift cards are sent directly to the

444
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,920
scammers the scammers post them up on on

445
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,759
some place like paxful and then they're

446
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
immediately laundered from there

447
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
but really i think one of the real

448
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
reasons that gift card uh attacks have

449
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
become so popular is the population of

450
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
potential employees that can be targeted

451
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,000
by these attacks is significantly higher

452
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,720
you know essentially any any employee at

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
a company can be the target of one of

454
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,240
these attacks you know i've seen gift

455
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,480
card bec campaigns targeting a single

456
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
organization where 50 or 60 employees

457
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
were targeted at any given time

458
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
and this isn't a you know the success

459
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
rate needs to be really high for these

460
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,399
attacks

461
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,720
if i'm just making if my success rate is

462
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
maybe one percent

463
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,079
i'm having a good pay day at the end of

464
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,199
the day

465
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,959
and so i think that's one of the really

466
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,600
big reasons that uh that these types of

467
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
attacks become so popular

468
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,079
the downsides to these are the payouts

469
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,000
are much much smaller the average

470
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
request we see for gift card btc attacks

471
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,959
is about uh a thousand to fifteen

472
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,839
hundred dollars and the employees are

473
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,240
much less convincing you know i sort of

474
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,600
ran through what one of these things

475
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,519
might look like and while the initial

476
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
premise of one of these attacks that you

477
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
know i need rewards for

478
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,680
for employees or gifts for customers may

479
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,600
make a little bit more sense as you go

480
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,440
along with this and you try to get the

481
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
employee to go purchase these individual

482
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,480
cards take pictures of them uh each one

483
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,079
of them individually send them all

484
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,640
separately scratch off the backs of them

485
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
you know they have to be emailed and not

486
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,919
sent in person

487
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
it sort of allows a lot of time for red

488
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,599
flags to sort of pop up here but i think

489
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
obviously because we've continued to see

490
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,079
such a big rise of these types of

491
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,480
attacks about 50 of all the bec attacks

492
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
we see on a monthly basis are requesting

493
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,360
gift cards and it's been steady over the

494
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
past couple of years because they're so

495
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
popular that must mean that the return

496
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
on investment the roi for these attacks

497
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
must still be there or else the actors

498
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,480
wouldn't continue to do them

499
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,120
but really the biggest bec threat today

500
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,960
that i think is really important for

501
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
everyone to understand and as we go

502
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,000
through with this this is really where

503
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,480
security awareness really comes in

504
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,440
is what we call vendor email compromise

505
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
and vendor email compromise is

506
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
essentially a hybrid between credential

507
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
phishing attacks and identity deception

508
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,320
attacks where a threat actor may

509
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,559
use a phishing a a credential phishing

510
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,600
campaign

511
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,320
to

512
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,559
compromise mailboxes of a number of

513
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,080
different employees

514
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,840
the actor will then go into those

515
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,400
mailboxes and identify high-value

516
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
targets that are um that are involved in

517
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
things like payments or invoices or

518
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
customer contact

519
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
and once those high-value targets have

520
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,080
been identified

521
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
they will then sit on those mailboxes

522
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
and collect intelligence to better

523
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
understand you know when payments are

524
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
due who the customers are what normal

525
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
communication patterns look like they'll

526
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
steal copies of invoices

527
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,720
and they'll sit on these mailboxes for

528
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
weeks if not months until they

529
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
eventually inject themselves into a

530
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,559
legitimate payment that's actually

531
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
supposed to be due and they know what's

532
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
actually due because they're getting all

533
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,960
the information from these mailboxes

534
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,039
and then they target one of those vendor

535
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,039
suppliers customers with an email that

536
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
looks extremely realistic

537
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,320
because

538
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,600
they're using all this information

539
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,880
they've collected

540
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
and so the ultimate target here is going

541
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,799
to be that vendor or suppliers

542
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,919
customers

543
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,280
that are going to be the ones sending

544
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,039
out the payment

545
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,120
and vendor email compromise is really

546
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,240
interesting because i think when you

547
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
when you talk to most people about

548
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,760
phishing attacks today

549
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
most people will probably give you the

550
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
answer of know who would actually fall

551
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
for these types of attacks and what's

552
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,400
interesting about vendor email

553
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
compromise when you look at these emails

554
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,440
the

555
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
the question goes from you know who

556
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
would actually fall for this to who

557
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
wouldn't fall for this because

558
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,320
everything looks really really really

559
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
real realistic when you're looking at

560
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,640
these types of attacks

561
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,320
you know one category of of bec attacks

562
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
that we've seen become more frequent

563
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
over the really of the past six months

564
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,799
or so

565
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,600
are uh bec attacks that are requesting

566
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
aging reports and this is what i

567
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,200
consider to be you know a vendor email

568
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
compromise attack really without the

569
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
initial compromise

570
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,919
and so for those of you who don't know

571
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,159
what an aging report is an agent report

572
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,559
is a report that's handled by vendors

573
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,840
and suppliers

574
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,159
that contains all of the outstanding

575
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,320
payments that are due by customers and

576
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,039
also includes all of the additional

577
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,799
contact information for those customers

578
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,720
for whoever we're getting for whoever

579
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
the accounts payable person is at those

580
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
customers and what we've seen more

581
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,360
recently is instead of compromising

582
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
accounts we've seen actors impersonating

583
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,799
uh you know

584
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,960
some executive at a company

585
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
contacting an accounts receivable

586
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
specialist and saying hey can you send

587
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,200
me the most up-to-date aging report um

588
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
for for my for my for my understanding

589
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,960
for my knowledge i can do some research

590
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
and the employee may send that that

591
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,640
report which looks very similar to what

592
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,520
you see on the screen here and the the

593
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,080
actors will then use that information to

594
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
craft an email that's going to be

595
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
targeting

596
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,919
uh that vendor or suppliers customers

597
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,520
very much in the exact same way that we

598
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
see with classical vendor email

599
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,640
compromise attacks except there isn't

600
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
there is no actual mailbox compromise on

601
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,918
the front end

602
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
and so why are vendor email compromise

603
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,679
attacks such a threat so one is the

604
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,280
amount that's lost in these types of

605
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
attacks is usually significantly higher

606
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
to other types of bec attacks and as i

607
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,520
mentioned earlier um you know on average

608
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,679
wire tran you know general ceo

609
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,360
impersonation executive impersonation

610
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,520
wire transfer bec attacks the average

611
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,600
requests there are between 50 and 60

612
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
thousand dollars usually um there was

613
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,039
some great research that was done by the

614
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,120
better business bureau about a year ago

615
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,799
that shows that for vendor email

616
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,240
compromise attacks

617
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
the amount that's requested or lost in

618
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,919
those attacks is about a hundred and ten

619
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,000
thousand dollars so we're talking about

620
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
generally twice

621
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
twice the amount of money that's being

622
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
lost from vendor email compromise

623
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,720
attacks to other types of wire transfer

624
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,799
vec attacks

625
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,640
also the actors are using trusted

626
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,600
identities individuals that the employee

627
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,880
is actually communicating with on a

628
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,720
regular basis because they're part of

629
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
these financial transactions and so

630
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
because that trust has been built up and

631
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,679
the employee recognizes those normal

632
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,440
communication patterns that the actor

633
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
actually knows they're able to sort of

634
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
leverage that trust to their advantage

635
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
again as i mentioned there these emails

636
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
are crafted using real intelligence that

637
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
are collected from these mailboxes which

638
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,640
results in extremely realistic looking

639
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,080
uh emails that are being sent to the

640
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,640
vendor and suppliers uh customers and

641
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
then the final reason that they're such

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,320
a threat is you know as i mentioned the

643
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,440
ultimate

644
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,559
organizations that are sending the money

645
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,120
are the customers that being said the

646
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
ones that are actually compromised are

647
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,679
the vendors and so the cut the the the

648
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
customers that don't actually have have

649
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
actually no

650
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
uh no control

651
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,280
over the initial compromise so it that

652
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
that compromise occurs outside their uh

653
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,320
their area of control and because that

654
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,520
happens they're not able to very well

655
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,640
monitor for any potential ato activity

656
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,280
also the generally speaking the vendors

657
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,400
and suppliers that we see being

658
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
compromised by vendor email compromise

659
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
attacks

660
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
are generally much smaller than other

661
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,480
types of organizations that may not have

662
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,120
the resources that can be dedicated to

663
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,559
things like security awareness training

664
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,720
or other types of email defenses

665
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,039
and so you know i've seen i've seen uh

666
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,120
or you know companies as small as five

667
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,840
people be the initial uh uh target of a

668
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,679
vendor email compromise attack on the

669
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,520
phishing side of things and that small

670
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,440
vendors customers were then targeted

671
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
with follow-up phishing attacks

672
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,440
so there's a little bit of an overview

673
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,640
and we've so far we've looked at the

674
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,000
problem of bec we've looked at the

675
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,159
different types of bec attacks that you

676
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,159
might see on a day-to-day basis but i'll

677
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,760
close out here with looking at you know

678
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,919
security awareness training and how that

679
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,400
can be used to better prepare our

680
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,559
employees our users to defend against

681
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,720
these types of attacks

682
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
so the first thing to keep in mind here

683
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,159
and i mentioned this very at the very

684
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,039
beginning of my presentation you know

685
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,039
phishing is not just about links and

686
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,960
attachments as we've seen with bec

687
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,840
attacks most of these emails are only

688
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
going to contain text so if i'm training

689
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,520
my users to only look out for bad links

690
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,120
and bad attachments

691
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,840
it is it will not prepare them for these

692
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,679
response-based attacks

693
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,960
and that sort of goes into you know

694
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
security awareness training as it has

695
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
emerged as this

696
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,559
as this industry

697
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,720
it was originally built around

698
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,960
preventing malware attacks preventing

699
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,120
people from clicking on malicious

700
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,840
payloads it was not built around

701
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,080
identifying you know basic social

702
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,039
engineering attacks

703
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
also it's really important to keep in

704
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,360
mind that that one size doesn't fit all

705
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,840
you know from from a bec perspective

706
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,360
especially when we're talking about

707
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,000
vendor email compromise attacks because

708
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,400
those actors these cyber criminals are

709
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,360
using intelligence based on real-world

710
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,159
interactions if you're doing bec

711
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,640
security awareness training effectively

712
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
you should also be putting the time in

713
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,840
there to

714
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,120
to include that intelligence that a that

715
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
that that uh that a cyber criminal might

716
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,960
be might be using um to to socially

717
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,039
engineer your your users

718
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,360
and so it's much harder to automate

719
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
these more real-world bec attacks than

720
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,679
it is to automate something like a

721
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
credential phishing uh campaign or a or

722
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
a malware campaign it's much harder to

723
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,880
automate those types of attacks so you

724
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,919
actually have to put a little bit more

725
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,559
work to make that type of training more

726
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,400
effective and better for your users

727
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
and then finally i think this is really

728
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
important is you know

729
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,840
when we think about what we're trying to

730
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
accomplish with security awareness

731
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,000
training you know this is it has

732
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,720
traditionally been a metric driven

733
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
industry where i'm trying to get you

734
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
know what is my click rate what is my

735
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,919
success rate for for uh for a phishing

736
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,200
simulation

737
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,799
and what is what do you think about

738
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,720
what's more important is that data more

739
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,240
important or

740
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
is the fact that i'm trying to prepare

741
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,640
my users for more real world attacks is

742
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
that more important to think about when

743
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,880
you are running these security awareness

744
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,760
campaigns and b it's actually it's and i

745
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
say that because it's very hard to

746
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,320
measure

747
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
the effectiveness and the success rate

748
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,640
of response based attacks because you

749
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,600
know with most phishing simulations

750
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
being able to click on click a link or

751
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,640
open a payload is relatively easy to

752
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,840
detect but with bec attacks i have to

753
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,760
actually look out for whether someone is

754
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,279
responding to an email and that requires

755
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
additional infrastructure being set up

756
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,919
it requires additional monitoring that

757
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,919
most security awareness

758
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,679
training platforms don't have the

759
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,640
ability to do and so you know

760
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,799
while we want to be able to to measure

761
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,880
the the get some metrics behind our

762
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,760
security awareness uh uh simulations you

763
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,840
know that's not always possible and you

764
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,679
know when we're talking about you know

765
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,919
is it better to you know leave that data

766
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,919
behind and just make sure our users and

767
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,000
employees are prepared you know that's

768
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,360
that's sort of a trade-off that you have

769
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,760
to think about

770
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,919
and so that's all that's all i have for

771
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,000
today um i'd be welcome to answer any

772
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
questions um any any contact information

773
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,760
you see some contact uh information here

774
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
on this slide feel free to reach out if

775
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
anyone else has any questions

776
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
all right so lots of questions crain

777
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,799
that was fast and furious

778
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,440
so folks um just one or two quick points

779
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
and then we're going to ask craig bec

780
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,720
stands for business email compromise

781
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,840
also commonly known as ceo fraud as

782
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,919
we've been saying throughout this uh

783
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,480
event and crain pointed out people a lot

784
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
of times have different definitions

785
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
and the other thing oprah i'm going to

786
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,120
ask um one question i've been seeing

787
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,039
asked in slack and then i'm going to go

788
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,200
to the q a in soon

789
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,640
is these seem seem so basic you know

790
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,559
gift cards asking it for a wire transfer

791
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,039
why are people falling for these what

792
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,440
are the bad guys doing that makes this

793
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,000
so effective and people happily transfer

794
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,480
money happily buy gift cards

795
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,080
that's a great question i think this

796
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,279
goes back to something i mentioned a

797
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,720
little bit earlier is you know at its

798
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
core social engineering is extremely

799
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,960
effective the same themes you see

800
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
over and over and over again in bc

801
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,200
attacks as well as other types of

802
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,440
fishing campaigns you know these actors

803
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
have learned to harness the same

804
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,360
principles that uh that that that you

805
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,640
know con artists have been able to use

806
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,840
for for a number of years fear anxiety

807
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,559
doubt reward these are the themes that

808
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,679
you see over and over and over again

809
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,080
in these uh in these phishing attacks

810
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,559
and those are the that's essentially you

811
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,480
know it's very hard to override our

812
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,279
ingrained human nature to trust what we

813
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,919
see in front of us and so that's that's

814
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
prime that's one of the primary reasons

815
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,440
that um

816
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
that these are being so successful it's

817
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,200
also you know when you look at the the

818
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
weaknesses of email just generally

819
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,440
speaking the the fact that i'm able to

820
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,919
very easily change the display name to

821
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,080
make it look like it's coming from a ceo

822
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,320
or some other executive you know adds

823
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,000
that level you know for most people who

824
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,080
aren't technically sophisticated i'm

825
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,679
gonna trust that that email is coming

826
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,399
from my ceo without giving any other

827
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,000
without uh having any other information

828
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,919
to make me think that it's not

829
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,080
so i was reading those examples you

830
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,600
shared crane which are awesome and what

831
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
i noticed is one

832
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,240
almost no spelling errors no grammar

833
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
errors in this case since they were

834
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,240
english based the english was very good

835
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,399
but also like you said it seemed like

836
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,960
the bad guys had done their research

837
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
they were pretending to be an executive

838
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,200
they pretended like they knew the

839
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,039
individual they pretended like they were

840
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,480
part of the company

841
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,559
that seems like part of what makes this

842
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
so successful

843
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,240
absolutely so we we see that more and

844
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,799
more it's more common you know while we

845
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,399
certainly see a heavy volume of the bec

846
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,559
attacks that have the traditional

847
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,919
spelling grammatical errors and most

848
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,360
people would be like what is what is

849
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,799
this i would never fall for this type of

850
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,399
thing you know you have some of the more

851
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,840
sophisticated actors that are moving

852
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,640
into the bec space that really take

853
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
their time crafting these messages even

854
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,200
outside of the vendor email compromise

855
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
realm you know just in the basic you

856
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,520
know ceo impersonation attacks

857
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,279
you see a lot of these actors that are

858
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,080
now

859
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,840
requesting more

860
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
more and more uh higher and higher

861
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,720
amounts of money

862
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,039
and taking the time to craft very

863
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,919
sophisticated um lures that are being

864
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,000
sent to these uh to employees to the

865
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,279
point where there are some groups that

866
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,039
we know i

867
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,039
really feel that there's you know in the

868
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,559
on these underground you know

869
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,360
underground forums that there is a um

870
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,279
they're actually hiring people to

871
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,600
translate certain uh certain emails for

872
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
them that are in perfect either native

873
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
english or native french or native

874
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
whatever language um to make them more

875
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,279
effective

876
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,279
and then where are these threat actors

877
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,320
getting this information on people

878
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,679
so that's a great question you know

879
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,960
what's really interesting when we when

880
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,880
we on when we look at you know how

881
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
targets are identified through bec

882
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
attacks what's really interesting is

883
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,919
that the same legitimate commercial

884
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,159
services that sales and marketing teams

885
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,399
all over the world use to identify

886
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,120
sales prospects these are the exact same

887
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,320
services that bec actors are are using

888
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,720
to identify targets and so they'll go in

889
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,080
for either a um or either a a short-term

890
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
trial or even use a compromised credit

891
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,919
card to pay for one of these services

892
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,080
and they can do a number they can search

893
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,000
on a number of different variables and

894
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,519
receive a very finely nicely organized

895
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,919
and curated list of potential targets

896
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,240
meeting those criteria that then then

897
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
use to supplement with additional open

898
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,720
source uh information to identify things

899
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,399
like who the ceo or executive i'm going

900
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,640
to be impersonating is and use that as

901
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,039
their base of targeting information to

902
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,600
then send out the the btc campaigns

903
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,399
so crane brings up a fantastic point we

904
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,000
think the bad guys are getting this

905
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,919
information because they're hacking our

906
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,159
data they're finding an insider threat

907
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,080
they're going to the dark web and

908
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,600
dealing with other cyber criminals and

909
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
cranes like no if i want to hack a

910
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,440
company and if i want to learn about

911
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,840
executives i'll just go to any sales

912
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,159
database and buy the marketing data

913
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,760
because the data rate's already out

914
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,039
there yeah

915
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,399
exactly

916
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,440
that's exactly what they're doing i

917
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,480
think what's what's also really

918
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,240
important to keep in mind is that there

919
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,159
is a very robust

920
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,080
underground communication network

921
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,159
between these actors where they're

922
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,240
always sharing tactics and techniques

923
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,480
with each other to help each other out

924
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,640
to to make their attacks more successful

925
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
so and this is this is always going to

926
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
be a cat and mouse game where we're

927
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,919
going to be you know evolving our

928
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,360
defenses and making them better and

929
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
they're going to pivot in a direction

930
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,640
and we all this that's why threat

931
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,559
intelligence is so important because

932
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,080
then we need to know where they're

933
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,760
moving to what the next iteration of

934
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,360
these attacks uh is going to be in the

935
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,720
future

936
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,120
all right fantastic crane really really

937
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,720
appreciate it and folks that's what

938
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,840
makes be so dangerous in many ways it's

939
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,240
a spear phishing attack wailing attack

940
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
but no links

941
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
no attachments the bad guys have done

942
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,240
the research and people are falling for

943
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,799
it to the tune of billions of dollars a

944
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,200
year crane thank you so much folks if
