1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,160
for our first track talk of today i'm

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,000
super excited to have abigail from

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,880
salesforce

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
we were very excited to have her talk

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,720
because she's going to be focusing on

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
the partnership side of managing risk

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
you cannot effectively manage human risk

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,320
if you're working all by yourself in

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,680
isolation you've already seen some

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,920
tidbits of this how it's recommended you

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,040
partner perhaps for example with your

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
digital forensics or incident response

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
team but you should also be partnering

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,600
with human resources

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,559
audit communications marketing

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
you to really effectively manage human

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,440
risk you have to have really good

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
partnerships with other organizations i

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,719
sometimes joke if you don't like working

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
with and helping other people

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
you're probably in the wrong career

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,760
awareness and you're going to struggle

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
because the key part of this job is

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,520
liking and working with others and the

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,600
other real win when we saw abigail's

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
mission is this

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
she's with salesforce salesforce

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
continually has one of the most mature

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,240
security awareness programs i've seen at

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
a global level now they have tremendous

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
resources also so bonus to them all

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,119
right abigail thank you so much for

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,840
joining us you are now on thanks

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
lance um hi everyone i am abby dealer

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,040
and i am currently a security awareness

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
manager at salesforce and i just want to

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
thank you so much for joining this

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
session on how we at salesforce built

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
partnerships to mature our security

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,880
awareness program

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
now i want to kick things off by asking

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
you to imagine a scenario

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,880
i want you to imagine a scenario in work

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
in which you've been working really

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,119
really hard for months to build and roll

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,280
out an omni channel security awareness

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,719
campaign

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,399
ahead of national security awareness

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,360
month

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
you know you ensure that all of your

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,079
templates and messaging are cohesive and

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,639
you roll out your campaign leveraging

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,720
all of the communicate communications

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
channels that are available to you

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
you're really thrilled because you know

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840
you just executed on your plan perfectly

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
well not really

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,319
soon after implementation you hear from

59
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,560
your corporate communications team

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,480
that you've used the wrong template you

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
know the one that you're only it's only

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,959
supposed to go out to customers and um

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,200
let's just say they're not pleased

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,920
and you think to yourself wow if only i

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,519
had partnered with that team throughout

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,280
this process

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
okay so you know a partnership with the

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
corporate communications team would have

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,519
obviously helped to avoid the scenario

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,440
that i just described

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
um that scenario is a pretty

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
sort of simplified illustration of how

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
critical strong partnerships can be for

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
successful execution of campaigns

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,239
but hopefully it did get your attention

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,720
and it brings me to the conversation

77
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
that i want to have today around

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
partnerships

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
in this talk i'll really be focusing on

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,000
partnerships

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
not just from the perspective of their

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,319
importance in helping you to deliver

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,360
targeted and on brand um

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,680
security education across various

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,040
audiences

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
but really how to build successful

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,000
partnerships in order to mature a

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
security awareness program and achieve

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,200
overall security awareness programmatic

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,839
goals

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,879
so as we all know and i think alex just

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,760
reinforced in his talk um the vast

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
majority i think it's 85

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,879
of cyber security breaches are a result

95
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,720
of human error

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,799
employees are often the primary attack

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
vector for cyber criminals and so

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
building a security awareness program is

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,840
really essential to help manage human

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
risk and create that strong culture of

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
security that i think we're all striving

102
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
for

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
salesforce security awareness

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
programmatic goals align to compliance

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
requirements

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
incident related issues and behaviors

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,920
particularly self-inflicted incidents

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
related to user negligence

109
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,120
salesforce's overall security strategy

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
and the effort to drive behavior change

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,560
across our organization

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
now particularly in this virtual

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,639
environment i you know this robust set

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
of goals can prove really challenging to

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
accomplish with one small team you know

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
maybe some of you only have one person

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
um so we at salesforce leverage

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
partnerships across our entire

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,680
organization to help us achieve our

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,639
programmatic goals

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
just a quick overview of the areas that

122
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
i'd like to touch on today

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,479
first and foremost the sans awareness

124
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
maturity model i'm sure most of you are

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,880
familiar with this given that you are at

126
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,039
a sans conference

127
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,960
and how our security awareness team at

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
salesforce uses it

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,800
then i'll talk a little bit about our

130
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,960
team's programmatic goals

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
the key partners that we identified to

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,919
help us achieve these goals

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,240
um some of the steps that we took to

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,720
solidify those partnerships

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
um and then of course the outcomes and

136
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,479
the impact from these partnerships on

137
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,720
our program and then you know i'll give

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
you a chance to

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
ask any questions that you all might

140
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,039
have

141
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
so with that let's dive in

142
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,440
um okay so as i mentioned earlier i'm

143
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,120
sure most of you are familiar with the

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,520
sans security awareness maternity model

145
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
but in case you're not or in case you

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
need a refresher

147
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,039
the sand security awareness model is

148
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,280
really an inch industry benchmarking

149
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
tool that provides guidance on the

150
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,759
maturity level of a company's security

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,919
awareness program

152
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
and at salesforce we're really striving

153
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,960
to reach and maintain kind of those

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,199
sustained culture change and metrics

155
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
framework benchmarks for our program

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
and i will say that you know before we

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
identified and solidified some of the

158
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,520
partnerships that i'm about to outline i

159
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
would say salesforce was hovering

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,560
somewhere around you know that promoting

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,240
awareness and behavior change benchmark

162
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
now aside from

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,199
achieving that sustained culture change

164
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
and metrics framework uh those positions

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
on the model we also have several

166
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,319
additional programmatic goals

167
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,240
first and foremost we must fulfill

168
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
compliance requirements um we have

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
several related to standards such as

170
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
uh pci fedramp and socks i'm sure some

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
of you are familiar with those and also

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
have to comply with those um

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
but yes compliance is really paramount

174
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,240
for us

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
um and next i would say we focus on

176
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,039
tackling instant related issues

177
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,880
particularly those related to

178
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
self-inflicted incidents caused by user

179
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,560
negligence

180
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
these types of incidents typically

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
involve a set of key security behaviors

182
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,680
that are both engineering and

183
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,520
non-engineering related

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,039
our third goal is to support the

185
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,440
strategy of our security organization

186
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,599
pretty self-explanatory

187
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
um and then last but not least our last

188
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
goal is to drive behavior change within

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
the company

190
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,240
so i won't get into the specific

191
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,319
breakdown of what each of these goals

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,440
entails but i will say you know overall

193
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,520
accomplishing all of these feels like a

194
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
pretty big scope for us even though we

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
do have a pretty robust um team and

196
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,199
program um but you know it felt daunting

197
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
for us as a team to tackle alone so we

198
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
came up with the idea of trying to

199
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
address and achieve these established

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
goals through partnering with other

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,599
teams across our organization

202
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
and we had a lot of conversations around

203
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,759
which teams made most sense to try to

204
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,400
partner with um and after a great deal

205
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,280
of discussion a few teams both within

206
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
the security organization and outside of

207
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
the security organization came to mind

208
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
so now i will talk about kind of the key

209
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
partners that we identified

210
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,599
the first set of partners we identified

211
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,160
were the sales force incident response

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
and threat intelligence team and we call

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
our instant response team c-cert so

214
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
you'll probably hear me reference that

215
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
throughout this talk

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,240
um and both of those lie within security

217
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
and we wanted to partner with both teams

218
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
to understand kind of the incident

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,958
related issues that salesforce was

220
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,839
currently experiencing as well as that

221
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,240
external threat landscape

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,720
um we figured that data from the csr

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
team should really inform our awareness

224
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
efforts and help us drive down the

225
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,360
number of self-inflicted incidents

226
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,080
related to user negligence

227
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,519
we also thought that the data from

228
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
threat intel could help us get ahead of

229
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,720
any emerging threats and avoid any new

230
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,200
incidents that might be on the horizon

231
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,680
remember one of our team's primary goals

232
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,000
is to tackle those incident related

233
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
issues

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
so the second team we thought would be

235
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
beneficial to partner with was our

236
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
employee communications team

237
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
so remember the scenario that i

238
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
described in the beginning of my talk

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
yes well we wanted to avoid that from

240
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
actually happening to us

241
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
and we thought that employee

242
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,760
communications could help us understand

243
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,480
the proper channels available to us for

244
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
our campaigns and to really help us

245
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,480
share our data-driven messaging

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
the third team that we wanted to partner

247
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,800
with was employee success strategy and

248
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
analytics

249
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
now keep in mind that two of the

250
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,279
security awareness team's main

251
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,360
programmatic goals are around

252
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
establishing a metrics framework and

253
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,320
driving behavior change

254
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
and display employee success and

255
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,839
strategy and analytics team was really

256
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
interesting for us to talk to because

257
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
they specialize in understanding

258
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,320
employee behaviors through data among

259
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,839
other things

260
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
and so we really wanted to talk to them

261
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
then lastly we thought you know it would

262
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
be beneficial to connect with the

263
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
information management and strategy team

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,279
they sit within the security

265
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,160
organization like cser and threat intel

266
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
and they are really focused on data

267
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
governance

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
we wanted more intelligence and metrics

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,040
around our employees security behaviors

270
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
and we needed to ensure that the data

271
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,800
that we could potentially be looking at

272
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
or storing was properly classified

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,079
um so now that i talked about the

274
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,920
different teams and organizations that

275
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,399
we wanted to partner with and why i kind

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
of like to shift to the how we went

277
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,200
about solidifying those partnerships

278
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
um we first identified individuals in

279
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,640
each of these organizations that we

280
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
thought would be appropriate to meet

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
with

282
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
we reached out to those folks and asked

283
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,959
if we could set up meet and greets with

284
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,279
them you know pretty simple

285
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,399
um

286
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,920
and during those meet and greets we

287
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,079
asked a lot of questions in order to

288
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,079
really understand what the needs of

289
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
their teams were

290
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
and we we learned some great insight for

291
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
instance you know when we spoke with

292
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,480
members of our incident response team we

293
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,040
learned that they were very swamped uh

294
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,959
with triaging self-inflicted incidents

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,959
related to user negligence and they

296
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,640
desperately wanted to

297
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,200
reduce those numbers

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
when we spoke with employee

299
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
communications they emphasized their

300
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
need to focus on building trust in the

301
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,519
sales force brand and reinforcing

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,600
messaging around trust which is

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
salesforce's number one value

304
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
when we talk to employee success

305
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
strategy and analytics they profess

306
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,200
their need for more insight intelligence

307
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
and data around different types of

308
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,680
employee behaviors

309
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,040
when we met with the information

310
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
management and strategy team

311
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
they mentioned needing to improve sales

312
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
force's data management maturity

313
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
so as security awareness professionals

314
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
you're probably already starting to see

315
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
some of the commonalities here between a

316
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,720
security awareness team's needs and

317
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
those of the other teams that we met

318
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,320
with

319
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
once we identified needs we work to

320
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
really align on common goals

321
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,399
so for example

322
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,880
similar to the c-cert team the security

323
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
awareness team has a goal of driving

324
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,800
down the number of self-inflicted

325
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
incidents related to user negligence

326
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
and similar to the employee

327
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,959
communications team

328
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,200
the security awareness team has the goal

329
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
of reinforcing key security behaviors

330
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
related to trust as security is a key

331
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,639
component of trust

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,240
and you know we believe that it's

333
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
everyone's responsibility at salesforce

334
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,440
to preserve the trust of our customers

335
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,399
and the value of our products

336
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,079
so moving on to the commonalities with

337
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,720
employee success strategy and analytics

338
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
just like them

339
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,279
the security awareness team wanted data

340
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,800
around different types of employee

341
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,399
behaviors

342
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
of course our team's focus is really

343
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
around you know key security behaviors

344
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,440
and their associated risk to sales force

345
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
um but that data did fold into what the

346
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,480
es strategy was looking for

347
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
um and our team the security awareness

348
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
team also had a goal of creating an

349
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,040
automated dashboard to showcase that

350
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,440
data and the risk around it

351
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,320
and the employee success strategy team

352
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,399
had the expertise and resourcing to

353
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
support that build which was great

354
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,440
and then lastly if we were going to

355
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
create a dashboard that contained such

356
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,240
data about employees we need help with

357
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
the classification of it from the

358
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
information management and strategy team

359
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,519
and it was a huge bonus that they you

360
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
know wanted to beef up their program's

361
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,120
maturity

362
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,040
so once we kind of aligned on these

363
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,760
common goals and narratives each team

364
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
went to their respective executive to

365
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,519
achieve buy-in

366
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,000
and as i think you know most of us know

367
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
executives tend to hold the power of the

368
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
purse and are typically the decision

369
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,240
makers so achieving buy-in for any

370
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,519
project is very critical

371
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,120
given that our teams had aligned on

372
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,279
mutual goals they were all able to

373
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,120
achieve buy-in from their executives

374
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,839
relatively easily and obtain resourcing

375
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
for the efforts

376
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
and i just wanted to showcase um

377
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,920
our security awareness dashboard project

378
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,600
given that i would say

379
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
it required the most effort and buy-in

380
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
and resourcing from other teams

381
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,079
and this project ties directly into the

382
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,480
security programmatic goals and kind of

383
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
stemmed from the desire for

384
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,199
both our security awareness team and our

385
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
security leadership as a whole

386
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,800
to have more insight into security

387
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
behavior and human risks across our

388
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
organization

389
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
and we thought it would be able to you

390
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
know provide us with better metrics to

391
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,880
um provide more targeted education to

392
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,360
employee population groups and

393
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
really uh indicate the success of our

394
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
overall program

395
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,160
so for this project we basically looked

396
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,040
at a variety of different uh data inputs

397
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
that we thought were key indicators of

398
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,440
human risk across salesforce

399
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
and you can see some key examples here

400
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,360
you know we have compliance and training

401
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
completion stats

402
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
phishing metrics

403
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,519
key engineering behaviors um

404
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,160
employees onboarded by security incident

405
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,360
reporting

406
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,519
incidents related to user negligence

407
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,600
which i know i mentioned are very key

408
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,279
for us

409
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,920
last passage option metrics and employee

410
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
patching stats

411
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
and then we worked to kind of funnel

412
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,480
those into a tableau dashboard and for

413
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,600
those of you who aren't familiar with

414
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,959
tableau

415
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,880
it's a data visualization tool and it

416
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,639
was actually recently acquired by

417
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
salesforce so it was great that we could

418
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,079
really leverage that

419
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,000
um and while our dashboard build out is

420
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
still in progress i thought you know it

421
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,920
would be great to kind of showcase its

422
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
prototype at a really high level

423
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,959
um as you can see we've assigned weight

424
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,959
to various behaviors

425
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,279
and inputs and compiled them into a

426
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,519
dashboard that you know displays risk

427
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
levels across different organizations

428
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,920
within our company

429
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,320
and then this allows us to provide

430
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
targeted education and awareness to

431
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,199
particular population groups based on

432
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,880
risk and need

433
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
and i do just want to say that um you

434
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
know all the stats and the information

435
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
listed here are meant to be

436
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,160
purely illustrative and you know are not

437
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
based on any real sales force data so

438
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,440
just wanted to flag that

439
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
um and then next i just wanted to share

440
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
a couple of highlights

441
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
from a few of the conversations we had

442
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,800
with our key partners about the mutual

443
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,519
benefits of our partnership particularly

444
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,519
um with the dashboard build up that i

445
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
just highlighted you know that project

446
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,439
was a big endeavor so

447
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,679
um first we hear from chakri who leads

448
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,520
our data engineering on the employee

449
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,160
success strategy analytics team and he

450
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,000
shared that their team

451
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
actively developed synergistic prod

452
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,199
projects with teams outside of es to

453
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
expand the human-centered philosophy of

454
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,919
running and managing organizations

455
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,839
the security awareness dashboard fits

456
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
the bill perfectly and is at the

457
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,919
cross-section of behavior and security

458
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,679
now keep in mind this is coming from a

459
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,720
team that's outside of security

460
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
and then we heard from michael who is

461
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
actually the data architect for the

462
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,320
dashboard and he shared that the

463
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,640
information management and strategy

464
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
team's involvement with the security

465
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
awareness program will help us improve

466
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
salesforce's data management maturity

467
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,320
so here you know you can really get a

468
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,559
window into kind of the conversations

469
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,559
that we had and see how

470
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,559
both teams partnered with us and really

471
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
benefited from helping to bring our

472
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,120
security awareness dashboard project to

473
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,039
life

474
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,520
and i do want to call out i know that um

475
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
i've made it seem like everything

476
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
throughout this process of solidifying

477
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,240
these partnerships was super easy um and

478
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
i just wanted to share that it wasn't

479
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,679
all rosie you know we definitely did

480
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,000
experience some challenges

481
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,679
um you know i would say that no matter

482
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,600
how good your case is

483
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
justifying resourcing for a project

484
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,799
outside of your team scope is never

485
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,440
an easy task and we certainly had to do

486
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
some convincing especially you know for

487
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,160
the dashboard project which as i said is

488
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,559
a pretty big endeavor

489
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,840
and i would also say you know with

490
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
employee communications too we had some

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,640
challenges um you know

492
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
they can be protective about messaging

493
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
that goes out to employees and

494
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
we definitely did have to explain to

495
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,640
them on multiple occasions why security

496
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
really is a key component of trust and

497
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,280
you know why it's so important that

498
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,080
employees do care about it so these

499
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
partnerships definitely helped us

500
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,919
achieve their goals but it did not come

501
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,400
without a set of challenges and i just

502
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,760
you know wanted to highlight that

503
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,919
anyway uh now that i shared kind of

504
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,240
how we built and solidified partnerships

505
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
outside and inside of the security

506
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
organization and with and without

507
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,600
challenges

508
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,360
um i kind of i want to talk about the

509
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
outcomes from those

510
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
so the incident response and threat

511
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,480
intel teams were able to provide us with

512
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,919
user negligence related uh data and

513
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,000
threat landscape data

514
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,039
and we then use that data to help inform

515
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,720
our proposed security awareness

516
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,559
campaigns

517
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,799
our employee communications team was

518
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,280
able to provide us with channels to

519
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,120
support our omnichannel security

520
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,520
awareness campaign and provided us with

521
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,919
metrics um you know success metrics

522
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,080
we're then able to take those metrics

523
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,880
and funnel them into a larger automated

524
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,039
security awareness dashboard developed

525
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,039
by our employee success and information

526
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,480
management strategy team

527
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
and there you have it the security

528
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
awareness team now has a metrics-based

529
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
approach that measures the success of

530
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,799
our program

531
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,720
this approach involves establishing

532
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
benchmarks and goals tied to key instant

533
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
related issues

534
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
and the continued build-out of a

535
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
dashboard to display key metrics for

536
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
leadership consumption

537
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
we're able to review those metrics for

538
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,360
continuous improvement of our program

539
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
and we're able to better prioritize

540
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,919
resourcing and develop more innovative

541
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,360
programs through established

542
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
commonalities across organizations

543
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,440
within the company

544
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,919
so now i'd like you to imagine another

545
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,840
scenario

546
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
imagine having access to a variety of

547
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,720
unique metrics you know beyond the

548
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,440
classic fishing and training numbers

549
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
related to your organization's key

550
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,159
security behaviors without having to ask

551
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,400
security leadership for any additional

552
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,799
headcount funding or resources

553
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
now this is not to say that i feel like

554
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
we've completely advanced to the metrics

555
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,440
framework position on the sans maturity

556
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,320
model

557
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
um i do think that there's a lot of work

558
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
to still be done in terms of continuing

559
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
to really refine our metrics and achieve

560
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
that desired state

561
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
however i do think that we're well in

562
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,320
our way

563
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,720
and as salesforce continues to grow and

564
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,679
evolve

565
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,520
the security awareness team hopes to

566
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,320
leverage new and existing partnerships

567
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,919
to meet the changing needs of the

568
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,520
company

569
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,120
and as evidenced through the

570
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
partnerships we've made and the impact

571
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
that i described today

572
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,480
the security awareness team at

573
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,039
salesforce really does play an integral

574
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,000
part in assisting the company to meet

575
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,520
its overall mission and goals
