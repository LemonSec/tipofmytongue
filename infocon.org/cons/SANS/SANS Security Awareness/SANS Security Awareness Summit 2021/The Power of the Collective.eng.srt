23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,840
start with a little story today so way

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
back in 2013

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
when i was working in marketing in an

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
automotive technology company um

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
i um well i've been working in marketing

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
my whole career starting with ford motor

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
company and i was pretty good at it

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
i did motor shows all over the globe

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,680
places like tel aviv casablanca tv ad

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
campaigns in cairo in the uk

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
and then later i did marketing for um a

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,720
nominative technology company that

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
belonged to adp the big payroll company

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
but i got bored with marketing

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
and then the chief security officer

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
approached the vp of marketing my boss

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,799
and said we should market our security

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,840
strengths

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,799
um

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,320
we should do thought leadership in our

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,799
industry to talk about security this was

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,119
the early days when the g-pack had just

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,079
happened

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,960
at black hat that year

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
and so i started working with a security

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,600
team on marketing projects in 2014 we

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
were spun off from that corporate parent

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,960
adp

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,399
and my work with the security team

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,040
turned into a full-time security role

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
the cso said i want to keep you doing

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,320
thought leadership and i also want you

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
to do instant communications and help

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
with board presentations and oh yeah run

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
a training and awareness program

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,759
and i said what's that he said you know

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,479
that stuff adp makes us do once a year

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,239
um and i said well people hate that

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,680
stuff i don't want to do that they just

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,720
click through that when they're on a

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,239
conference call

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,720
nobody really learns anything

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
and he said well then let's not do that

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,319
put put on your marketing hat use your

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,160
marketing brain and let's do something

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
else

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
so i did we ended up doing a series of

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
videos with our

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
newly hired ex-us secret service agent

72
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,080
edna and they were super successful

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
so successful in fact that when i came

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
to my first ever sand summit august 4th

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
of 2016 i had to look it up

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
uh i won the video awards competition so

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,239
here's lance and me with a lot less gray

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,160
hair between the two of us that we have

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,280
today

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,160
um

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
looking a lot younger but i tell you the

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
story to make a point when i was new to

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,239
this field i was the only one doing

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,879
that job at my company just like a lot

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,560
of you today

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
i had zero security experience i sat in

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
meetings with the security team where i

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,159
had no clue what they were talking about

89
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,319
um i felt like i had a mountain to climb

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
i had so much to learn

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
we had just been spun off so there was

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
nobody at adp that i could call

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
um

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,879
and so how do i even begin to launch a

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,799
training awareness program how do i get

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
started what are the best practices what

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,799
are the pitfalls to avoid where's the

98
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,480
recipe book

99
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
so i consulted google and there were two

100
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,239
entities that stood out to me at the

101
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
time back in 2014 one was sans and lance

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,840
spitzner the original thought leader and

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
the other was the national cyber

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
security alliance

105
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480

october our new evergreen logo and what

214
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
you'll notice here is that you see in

215
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,599
the negative space just a hint of a of a

216
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,560
shield

217
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400

um

226
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360

227
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,120

228
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,479
our reach is definitely global

233
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,759

last year we had about 3 200 and we are

238
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,479
seeing an increase of 25 year over year

239
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,840
in the number of people that sign up to

240
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,679

241

email again info at staysafeonline.org

285
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,000
so a little more about the the logo that

286
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
was new last year and our new tone of

287
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
voice document that goes that goes with

288
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,000
it um and brand standards

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,519
you will notice that we dropped the word

290
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
national last year it's not national

291
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,200
cyber security wireless month anymore

292
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
it's just cyber security awareness month

293
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
and this came from board members that

294
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
are international that celebrate the

295
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
month internationally and we do have so

296
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
many partners around the globe that we

297
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,920
thought it was it was kind of a

298
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,560
no-brainer to drop the national

299
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,399
we now with the rebrand will be fully

300
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
committed to using cyber security as one

301
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
word

302
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,120
you wouldn't believe how much you can

303
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
debate that whether it's two words or

304
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
one um

305
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,880
but it's now one word in when we talk

306
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
about october and it's also going to be

307
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
one word when we talk about our

308
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,200
organization name

309
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
we're also not using any acronyms

310
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,839
i find that they can be really

311
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,519
alienating if you don't know what they

312
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
stand for they immediately immediately

313
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,839
make you feel like you're an outsider

314
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,640
and we want to be very inclusive one big

315
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,399
exception to using acronyms is the

316
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,600
federal government they love their

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
acronyms so some federal programs you

318
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
might still see those

319
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,399
we also found that acronyms like

320
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,800
csamc sam for cybersecurity awareness

321
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
month stand for a lot of other things um

322
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,440
so when somebody googles that they're

323
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
not necessarily going to find what we

324
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,399
want them to find

325
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,640
so in general we won't be using them any

326
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,320
longer and we encourage everybody else

327
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
to dispel out cyber security awareness

328
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,240
month as well 95 of our champions use

329
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
our materials um

330
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
and these particular documents the

331
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
graphics standards manual and the tone

332
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,480
of voice document are meant to be shared

333
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
with your communications and marketing

334
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
teams beyond just use for your internal

335
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
security awareness programs we are

336
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
seeing more and more companies starting

for our channel

351

you'll see plenty of videos available

352
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
along with a recording of a recent

353
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,160
webinar how to get involved in cyber

354
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,199
security awareness month

355
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,200
so a little bit more about that tone of

356
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
voice document that's included in the on

357
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
the website as a download

358
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
when we all communicate about security

359
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
awareness using consistent language and

360
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,519
tone especially for october that

361
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,240
magnifies our impact that's the power of

362
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,959
our collective voice so in that document

363
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,200
we outlined four tenets impact

364
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
empowerment collaboration and simplicity

365
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,920
and you'll notice that fud and

366
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
fear in general are nowhere on that list

367
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,440
so let's talk about impact the impact

368
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,279
that cyber crime has on companies and

369
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
societies is obviously a very real one

370
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,160
but when writing about these potential

371
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
threats we can make the point that it's

372
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
a matter that should be taken seriously

373
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,800
but it's far from being hopeless um so

374
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
here's an example taken from that guide

375
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,639
ceos from around the world have claimed

376
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,240
that cyber crime is the number one risk

377
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,920
that will affect companies in the future

378
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,360
but there are proven techniques to

379
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,279
prevent it so

380
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,720
talking about that impact but not

381
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
talking about it in a way that uses

382
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,279
fear i think is

383
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
is more impactful

384
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
empowerment so raising awareness and

385
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
educating people inspires confidence and

386
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
that should ease anxiety about security

387
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,079
issues not increase it the result of the

388
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,519
messaging should leave people feeling

389
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,440
good and informed about the simple

390
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,240
practices to keep their info safe

391
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
so again not using fear

392
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
promoting practical and empowering steps

393
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,480
that people can take is generally more

394
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,399
effective

395
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,240
collaboration everybody needs to do

396
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
their part so just like the cobot

397
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
vaccine everyone plays a role in

398
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
protecting society the collective

399
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,320
actions of individuals and organizations

400
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
exponentially amplify our effectiveness

401
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
so create content that fosters the

402
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,040
notion that doing it together is the

403
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,839
best way to keep everyone protected

404
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,920
and finally simplicity

405
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
anything is difficult to understand or

406
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
hard to read is usually

407
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,839
forgotten or not even read at all people

408
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
don't get past the headline

409
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,440
it's very easy

410
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,760
for our content to get too wordy or too

411
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
complicated and i would encourage you to

412
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
keep things simple to make your message

413
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,639
easier to digest and understand

414
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,800
stay away from technical jargon and

415
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,639
don't be afraid to add some personality

416
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
to your communications those are just

417
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
lisa's general communication tips for

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
the day

419
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,240
when we all band together as a

420
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
collective we have a greater impact

421
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,680
there is absolutely power in numbers

422
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
one of our goals for the national cyber

423
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,199
security alliance is for us to push more

424
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,560
into the consumer space which i've

425
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
talked about a little bit if we want to

426
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,959
change behavior leveraging the power of

427
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,199
consistency in our messaging will help

428
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,360
it stick that means all saying the same

429
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
things the same way particularly in

430
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,040
october like using the logo using the

431
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
hashtag

432
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,120
um

433
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,880
i like to compare it to susan g komen

434
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,480
and breast cancer awareness month right

435
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
you see that pink ribbon show up

436
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
everywhere

437
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
help us take cyber security awareness

438
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,600
month to the world um and go beyond what

439
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,760
we do with our organizations internally

440
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,120
a little bit

441
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
about our reach this was the combined

442
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,519
reach of all of our champions in 2020

443
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,759
over a hundred million people

444
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
and we're on a trajectory to grow our

445
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,759
reach especially with the focus more on

446
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,320
the end consumer and the individual and

447
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,839
realizing individual behavior change

448
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,519
so here's a look at cyber security

449
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,720
awareness month last year this is our

450
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
some figures from our traditional media

451
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,839
from publications like the washington

452
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
post and forbes and the

453
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
american tv network abc

454
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,920
8 400 unique articles published with the

455
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,040
global global reach of over 3.1 billion

456
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,680
of those articles 1300 referenced our

457
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
hashtag

458
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,560
resulting in 487 million global views

459
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,360
so leveraging this um

460
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
you know the hashtag and the logo and

461
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
the messaging guidelines amplify is not

462
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
just us it amplifies what you're doing

463
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
as well

464
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,839
um that's what it means to be part of a

465
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,279
collective this is some data from our

466
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,920
website from last october we are seeing

467
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,399
huge engagement increases over previous

468
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,320
years and we also see spikes in

469
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
engagement this really interests me and

470
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
really excites me

471
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,600
we will get more social followers and

472
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
website visitors anytime a major story

473
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
hits the mainstream media like the

474
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
colonial pipeline story so clearly

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,839
people are turning to us

476
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
for um plain spoken information about

477
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,720
cyber security and um we want to do that

478
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,040
even more

479
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,680
um our hashtag be cybersmart

480
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
um we had 77 000 tweets in 2020 for a

481
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
total of 725 million impressions so join

482
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,600
us sign up to be a champion and get on

483
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
board this october

484
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,119
these are some social posts from some of

485
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
our champions last year with the number

486
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
of followers you see there in pink from

487
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,439
each one of these organizations

488
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
these are some super impressive numbers

489
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,160
um if you can't get your marketing

490
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,480
departments do anything else publicly

491
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
with cyber security awareness month

492
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
on your external communications often

493
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,480
the easiest place to start is social

494
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
media and i'll give you a little insider

495
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,440
tip those social media managers are

496
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
hungry for content in most organizations

497
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
so unlike your public website where real

498
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,960
estate is really valuable and changes to

499
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
that website might be less frequent and

500
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,840
you might have to beg to put the

501
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
cybersecurity awareness month logo on

502
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
your home page

503
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
social media is a beast you have to feed

504
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,240
every day multiple times a day so your

505
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
social media manager might just love you

506
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
for bringing him or her so much new

507
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
content to use during the month of

508
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,480
october

509
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,520
and on the topic of social media content

510
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
here's an example from um one of our

511
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,160
recent social media campaigns that we

512
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,919
produced when i was still at media pro

513
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
which is now a part of know before it's

514
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
a series that really evokes empathy for

515
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
aging parents and their struggles with

516
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,919
technology it's called mom don't click

517
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,240
that started with a story that happened

518
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,440
to my mom

519
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,320
um

520
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,440
she was a victim of a support scam

521
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,679
but it could be with mom's dad's kids it

522
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,360
really doesn't matter these are

523
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,520
available on our youtube channel as well

524
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
and this is just a screenshot from an

525
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
episode that we filmed with our previous

526
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
executive director calvin coleman and

527
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,760
his dad who was the victim of a facebook

528
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,679
account take over and that's our

529
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,080
moderator um alex on the left who was

530
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
just recently on colbert doing standup

531
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,520
so really glad we started working with

532
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,600
him before he got famous

533
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,440
we we used this series to leverage the

534
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
power of real-life storytelling and some

535
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,760
of these parents are super adorable it's

536
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
entertaining it's educational

537
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,600
we film them with security executives

538
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
from microfocus raytheon and other

539
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,799
companies

540
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,360
if you or your cso have a story to tell

541
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
and you'd like to film an episode with

542
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,679
us

543
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,480
um

544
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,520
with a

545
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
family member

546
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,039
uh again reach out to us at info

547
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,799
at

548
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,280
staysafeonline.org we will keep

549
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
producing these as long as there are

550
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,480
interesting stories to tell and we can

551
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,840
learn from each other

552
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
another project we're super excited

553
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,480
about

554
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,039
has to do with the knowing doing gap

555
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,799
you've heard perry carpenter and lance

556
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,799
and others talk about the the knowing

557
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,799
doing gap that's people knowing what to

558
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,559
do but not actually carrying through

559
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,320
with changing their behavior

560
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
and we as an organization want to focus

561
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,160
more in the future on leveraging all

562
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,919
that reach that i just talked to you

563
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,280
about um to inspire real behavior change

564
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
our mission is to make an impact not

565
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,600
just to not just have reach but to have

566
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
impact with that reach

567
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
so we're collaborating on this research

568
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
project with sidesafe with um oz and his

569
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
team who was just on the on the panel

570
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,039
that hopefully you caught it was a great

571
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,240
panel

572
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
um the department of homeland security

573
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,919
funds a survey for us that we do every

574
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,200
year but this year we wanted to go

575
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
deeper and really understand people's

576
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
behavior and attitudes towards security

577
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,159
topics so we approached sidesafe and

578
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,000
they have graciously supported us to

579
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
turn a simple survey into a much more

580
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
rigorous research study it's actually

581
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,960
going on right now as we speak

582
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
and the results will be ready in october

583
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,720
so stay tuned for that report

584
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,039
so here's what we're studying cybersave

585
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,360
does work with the home office in the uk

586
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
and of course we work with dhs so we're

587
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
kind of taking advantage of some of that

588
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
synergy

589
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
and looking at differences on either

590
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
side of the pond as well and hopefully

591
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,679
in the future we can expand this

592
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,720
research

593
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
to um to other countries but we're

594
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
taking a more behavioral science

595
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,679
approach

596
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
so what are the general public's level

597
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,960
of

598
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
security awareness and engagement with

599
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,960
core security behaviors how does

600
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
awareness and engagement differ between

601
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,039
the us and the uk what are the potential

602
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,640
drivers and barriers

603
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,600
um

604
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,039
and we're focusing again we're taking

605
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,320
that behavioral science approach so

606
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,400
focus on focusing on capability

607
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,880
motivation and opportunity and i imagine

608
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,760
we'll hear more about that from bj fogg

609
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,600
and then we'll also look at demographic

610
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
differences um

611
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,600
age of course and other demographic

612
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,158
differences

613
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
these are the the list of desired

614
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
behaviors that we're focusing on and

615
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,480
i've included this here to encourage you

616
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,679
to also

617
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,760
use a relatively short list at the high

618
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,400
level in your programs to really stay

619
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
focused a lot of you have probably heard

620
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,760
me say before you don't have to feed

621
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
them lunch you just have to make them

622
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,799
hungry so when we push too much

623
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,520
information at once oftentimes people

624
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,320
push back instead of pulling

625
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
more information

626
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
so there might be further advice

627
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,039
obviously that rolls up to these items

628
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
but staying targeted and focused i think

629
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
can make us more effective you always

630
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,159
have the opportunity to tell people more

631
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,200
but less is more often to get engagement

632
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,039
remember how short people's attention

633
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,679
spans are so anyway look for the results

634
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,360
of this research in october

635
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
we would love for you to get involved

636
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,039
and i made a little slide here of just

637
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,039
absolute you know thought starters but

638
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,640
we are open to suggestions and

639
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
especially

640
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,919
since i'm new in the chair um and

641
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,720
brought a fresh set of eyes i'm happy

642
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
i'm up for any brainstorm that that you

643
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,919
want to have

644
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,440
first of all sign up to be a champion

645
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
for cyber security awareness month

646
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,679
maybe you might want to join the board

647
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,799
maybe you're already on the board and

648
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
you want to join a committee um

649
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
you might want to do a webinar with us

650
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
or be on a panel discussion

651
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,039
we're looking at adding um an advisory

652
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,280
board or other groups that can get

653
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,600
involved with us at different levels

654
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,919
different levels of of time commitment

655
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,919
different levels of financial commitment

656
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,679
so we're trying to expand how we

657
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,840
interact with everybody and of course

658
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
everybody on this um

659
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
at this event today and tomorrow is a

660
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,039
critical member of our of our community

661
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,440
so we're looking for new ways to partner

662
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
we are partnering with organizations on

663
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
cybersecure my business so we're

664
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
currently revamping our this nist-based

665
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,440
workshop series

666
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
and we want to aim at specific industry

667
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
verticals this is a great way to address

668
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,880
supply chain security chances are you

669
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
have a small business in your supply

670
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,520
chain somewhere upstream or downstream

671
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
and as we know they often struggle with

672
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,559
security

673
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,159
so if you'd like to become a sponsor of

674
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,159
one of these workshops please reach out

675
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,440
to us

676
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,039
i'll give you an example from my

677
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,840
automotive background

678
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
so we may when i talk about doing this

679
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
with industry verticals we may partner

680
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,440
with an industry association

681
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,880
like the national auto dealers

682
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
association or some auto manufacturers

683
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
or vendors in the automotive space to

684
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,240
create a custom workshop aimed at car

685
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,400
dealers or car care centers on how to

686
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,640
protect their business or maybe you're a

687
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,960
healthcare or a pharmaceutical company

688
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,400
and you'd like to partner to create a

689
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
workshop for

690
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
small rural hospitals for example that

691
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
struggle with security so these are just

692
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,559
a couple of thought starters

693
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,520
um

694
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
so we'd love to talk to you your

695
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,880
corporate responsibility teams if this

696
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
sounds interesting to you

697
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,279
drop us an email at info

698
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
staysafeonline.org

699
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,000
we're open to ideas um i'll give you

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
another example of another fresh idea

701
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
that's come to us lately just in a few

702
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,559
weeks that i've been in this job we've

703
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,360
had

704
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,039
some major corporations approach us they

705
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
want to make security enhancements

706
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
they're going to be visible to their

707
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,279
consumers these are public-facing

708
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,039
companies consumer-facing companies as

709
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,799
opposed to business to business and

710
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,559
they're coming to us to partner on

711
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,120
thought leadership around security best

712
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,799
practices for their consumers for the

713
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,200
general public at large so we're kind of

714
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,360
playing this role of um of the good

715
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,760
housekeeping seal of approval and doing

716
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,400
joint thought leadership just to to make

717
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
it um

718
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,679
to explain the why to your average

719
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,400
consumer on you know for example if if

720
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,279
you as a company were gonna make it um

721
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,360
you were gonna force multi-factor

722
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,840
authentication on your users or you were

723
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,960
gonna

724
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,240
have more

725
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440
stringent

726
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,279
guidelines for how difficult a password

727
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,200
has to be how complex a password has to

728
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,919
be

729
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,960
and you want to go out and do some

730
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
thought leadership around that um that

731
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,679
intersects with our mission and we love

732
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,440
projects like that because again it's

733
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,520
about the power of the collective and

734
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,600
the more organizations that that do

735
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
things like that the more companies that

736
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,799
do things like that that provide those

737
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,640
nudges to consumers

738
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,159
and the more we're able to do that kind

739
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,200
of joint thought leadership the more

740
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,960
other organizations will start to make

741
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,559
changes like that and again that's just

742
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,559
that's just good for

743
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,080
society

744
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,320
and good for the cause of security

745
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
um here you see our new tagline which is

746
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
also our super cool url and we will be

747
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,520
um

748
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,000
using this more frequently in the future

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,159
and it's how we plan to sign off all of

750
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,279
our presentations so i'll say thank you

751
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,120
and stay safe online

752
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880
thank you lisa this is really great to

753
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
see all the different resources that we

754
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,240
have here being shared

755
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,600
uh general

756
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,919
general consensus in our channels are

757
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,840
that people are really excited about

758
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
this wanted to quickly just let everyone

759
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
know there are some resources that have

760
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,320
been popped into both the hallway

761
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
channel for lisa and the national cyber

762
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,600
security alliance channel i'm

763
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,960
specifically in there there's some

764
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,880
information on that champion program

765
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
that lisa mentioned and wanted to

766
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,799
reiterate a question that i saw on here

767
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,799
which is it does not cost anything to be

768
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,360
a champion

769
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,919
one question is where do we find more

770
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,679
information on the committees it doesn't

771
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,919
seem obvious on the website no it won't

772
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,240
be because those aren't public um aren't

773
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,679
posted publicly um send us an email at

774
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,320
info stay safe online dot org and um

775
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,080
we have a marcom committee we have a

776
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
development committee we have various

777
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,559
committees made up of um existing board

778
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,600
members

779
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,159
if you're in a at a board member company

780
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,720
um one of the things that that we've

781
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
started to do is flex some of those

782
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,399
committees so in other words um

783
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
we might have a board member

784
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,840
representative and then a different a

785
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,200
different representative from the same

786
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,720
company that sits on a committee because

787
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,840
they have that particular expertise

788
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,720
so um if you have time that you want to

789
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,200
donate and you have expertise and

790
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,399
it could be development finance

791
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,080
marketing any of those types of things

792
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,960
or you have ideas that um in a way that

793
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
you would like to serve

794
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,720

put some thoughts together on different

800
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
ways that that people can get involved

801
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,440

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,880
very excited to share and partner with

813
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,039
you all as well i think we have time for

814
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,880
one more question that just came through

815
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
which was hoping to get a little

816
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,440
information about the champion toolkit

817
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,360
so how far in advance would they get

818
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,559
that toolkit and what are some of the um

819
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,080
would they be able to use some of the

820
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,159
content and the articles and they're uh

821
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,720
at their disposable to reuse

822
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
yes absolutely nothing is protected with

823
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,720
with trademark or or copyright you can

824
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,360
take the articles and reword things if

825
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,600
you want to fit your policies the

826
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
toolkit's available now

827
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
um if you go to the home page of the

828
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,120
website you'll see a box i think it's on

829
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
the left in orange if i'm not mistaken

830
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,080
that says um this has a there's a box

831
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,279
there about cyber security awareness

832
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,880
month or it's also in a pull-down menu

833
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,960
at the top and if you go there you can

834
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,320
sign up to be a champion and then you're

835
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
able to download the kit

836
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,720
um the kit has been out for

837
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,559
a couple of weeks now

838
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,679
um

839
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,559
that is something that we hear um year

840
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,159
after year that people would like to

841
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,919
have the kit sooner

842
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,600
um we are joined at the hip with the

843
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
department of homeland security with um

844
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
with sissa on how soon we can get the

845
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,399
kid out and how soon they it has to do

846
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,640
with how quickly they can announce the

847
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
weekly themes

848
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
so um

849
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
i think in the future we might try to

850
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
jump the gun a little bit

851
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
and um because we know that everybody in

852
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,039
private industry would love to have all

853
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,360
that information sooner and so i think

854
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
what we might do next year is look at

855
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,440
look at putting out um

856
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,399
you know

857
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,520
a kit sooner and then adding to that kit

858
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,320
once once sissa announces their weekly

859
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,640
themes and all that good stuff so that

860
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,399
so that if you want to get started you

861
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,960
can and again that logo

862
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,960
and the hashtag and our new um

863
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,679
tagline stay safe online all of that is

864
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,279
going to be evergreen that's going to be

865
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,960
that way year after year so you know

866
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,279
when you um use that logo that's not

867
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,960
going to be you know used to put

868
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,760
out

869
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,279
different graphics and different logo

870
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,520
every year and we

871
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,840
all collectively felt like that really

872
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
you know kind of watered us down if

873
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
mcdonald's changed their logo every year

874
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,919
you probably won't know who else was

875
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,840
anymore so um

876
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,520
so everybody can rely on that staying

877
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,200
consistent

878
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,440
perfect well i look forward to y'all

879
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,360
continuing to be the mcdonald's of the

880
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
awareness world

881
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
there are a couple more questions in the

882
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
hallway channels but in the interest of

883
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
time i will ask you lisa if you wouldn't

884
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,279
be so kind as to go in and answer those

885
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,080
directly if any of you on here have

886
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,679
other questions or thoughts absolutely

887
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,360
feel free to go into that hallway

888
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,919
channel and add them as well but overall

889
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,840

890
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,360
pleasure as always thank you
