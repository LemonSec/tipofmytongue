so

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
hey everyone and welcome to my talk

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,119
about

6
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,480
pulling on the string it's been a while

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
since i actually didn't talk in english

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,079
so try to bear with me i'm not sure i'll

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,160
be able to find all the right words or

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,879
even to

11
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,920
be able to describe all the right things

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
now this is a talk i've been

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,800
both dreading and anticipating uh for

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
for a really long time um mainly

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,320
because uh well yeah

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
i'm going to go through some stuff that

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,079
may or may not have happened

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,080
between the years of 2010 and 2015. if

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,360
if some of you

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,880
uh are on the call or some of you are

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,360
are following on and worked with me

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,000
between

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
those ears and there seems to be some

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
coincidence or something that seems

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,920
that it might be close to reality that's

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,520
purely fictional and purely coincidence

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,119
uh i i will state that again my opinions

28
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:29,920
are my own

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
uh all examples are purely fictional and

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
any resemblance to

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
reality is purely coincidence denzel

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,720

manage to to arrange one this year but

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
obviously because of the whole pandemic

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,760
thing that did not happen

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160

i'll be able to

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,080
yet anyway so

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
let's start at the beginning right

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
like all good stories i was a junior

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,879
incident responder

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,920
uh and a well

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,959
quite junior security person at this

73
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,920
time

74
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
and whether or not uh this was a company

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,159
i worked for

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,159
or a company that had hired me out is

77
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,120
besides the point what is not besides

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,239
the point that this

79
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,360
was around uh 10 years ago when

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
security was important

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
some players understood that security

82
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
was was a major thing

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,799
but others did not take it as seriously

84
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,360
there was a team of around 20ish people

85
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
that i worked with daily and

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,879
we were tasked with

87
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,560
both understanding the defensive posture

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,040
of

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,000
a organization as well as understanding

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
the potential

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,799
uh risks uh from an offensive point of

92
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,080
view

93
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
since this was finland having

94
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,080
offensive checkpoints and and what have

95
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,799
you wasn't

96
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,918
that big of a um

97
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,160
or that big of a part of our everyday

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,199
lives

99
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,280
and threat hunting wasn't something that

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,400
was regularly done

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,919
however it was something i had recently

102
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,960
learned about

103
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,479
and i was really eager to try try out

104
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,240
uh my new skills uh in the environment

105
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
against whatever information we had

106
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
lying around

107
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,199
now the cool thing uh with this company

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,560
was that that

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
we were encouraged by by the supervisor

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,960
at the time to

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
to uh try out new things be creative and

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,400
actively um work towards

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
the betterment of of the organization

114
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,039
or of the setup

115
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,639
of the um well security posture of the

116
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,680
organization

117
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
and being a junior i was really excited

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
to show off my skills i was ambitious

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,080
and driven to to uh well

120
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
start making a name for myself and

121
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,320
and showing that i knew what i was doing

122
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,639
beyond getting employed

123
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
so i was

124
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
i was in the midst of one of these

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
threat hunting exercises utilizing a

126
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,199
tooling

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,800
which well basically uh was just doing

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,840
a grep search or using grep against logs

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,800
like a larger subset of logs and trying

130
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
to find interesting things trying to

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
find uniqueness if you will

132
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,120
trying to find uh indicators of

133
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,240
compromise

134
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,520
and i stumbled upon something

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
that was quite interesting i stumbled

136
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,199
upon a string

137
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,479
that appeared at first as to be

138
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,840
gibberish

139
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,520
but with more

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,440
uh thought into it and with more

141
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,240
investigation into it i started seeing

142
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,520
the same string

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,960
appear uh multiple times uh at

144
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
periodic uh with periodic

145
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,880
uh timestamps so so it appeared to be

146
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,840
doing something and it appeared to be

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
doing something periodically

148
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
now in this uh company there was

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
a a large ish

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
technical that there was the largest

151
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,199
largest

152
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,199
logic uh setup of legacy systems and

153
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,160
and uh i couldn't be sure is this

154
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,919
actually an indicator of compromise or a

155
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,520
false positive

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
so i continue digging i started

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,240
looking at what ever could this mean

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,520
wherever

159
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,039
could could this be calling

160
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,199
and i started looking for when

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,919
this had first appeared like when uh was

162
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,319
the

163
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,080
earliest indication of said string

164
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
now that led to

165
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,039
an interesting problem at the time

166
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,240
the log retention time was uh six months

167
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,919
for for the organization and and for the

168
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,639
duration of those six months there was

169
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,440
nothing

170
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,960
uh or there was not a single instance

171
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
where this piece of uh ioc where this

172
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,599
string was not

173
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,720
uh visible in our logs and

174
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
my first instinct was holy [ __ ] this has

175
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,759
been here forever this is normal this is

176
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
a false positive i should probably not

177
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
continue investigating this however at

178
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,639
this point

179
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
i was so intrigued and so well into

180
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
this train of thought if you will

181
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,960
those of you who've ever worked with me

182
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
or know me even a tiny bit

183
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,319
know that i might get ridiculously

184
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,440
excited and interested about uh stupid

185
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,639
things and then i just

186
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,440
dwell all my time and energy into that

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,919
thing

188
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,879
that that thing of interest and this was

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
one of those things

190
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,440
and at the at the end of that

191
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,719
i i decided to consult with a

192
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,958
older more senior uh wiser

193
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,799
uh member of the team

194
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,320
and they quite wisely freaked

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,920
out they they immediately realized this

196
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,800
was weird

197
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,680
and asked all the right questions uh

198
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,399
when

199
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,080
uh was this last observed how did we

200
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,120
get to this point what are we going to

201
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
do now and what are what should our

202
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
containment measures be

203
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,760
if if i'm sounding way it's because

204
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
there is a very very real

205
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,000
reason for it so uh

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,760
our conclusion was uh oh my god

207
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,880
it's it's hackers they're they're uh all

208
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,920
the way

209
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,600
on our our internet all the way

210
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,880
into uh the heart of the organization

211
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
that this isn't

212
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,800
uh this isn't a small scale thing this

213
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
is a

214
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,440
a holy [ __ ] moment for us we go uh

215
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
[ __ ] uh we we are quite convinced now

216
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,760
that that we have been compromised and

217
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,640
for

218
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,480
uh whatever reason we

219
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,760
we decide to uh

220
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,519
escalate and bring in more people

221
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,760
uh bring in you know and start

222
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
presenting our findings to

223
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,920
uh higher ups now at that time

224
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,120
uh involving higher ups in any sort of

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
uh decision-making process regarding

226
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
security essentially meant

227
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
shut it all down and rebuild like those

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
were

229
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
the business continuity measures that

230
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
they were doing that that was it like

231
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,440
bam

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
close it all down uh us however

233
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
having had some training in forensics

234
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
and having some understanding about

235
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
uh the

236
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,440
evidence collection procedures that are

237
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,200
are needed having some having some

238
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,120
some understanding about if we ever

239
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
want to uh do something

240
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
with this information we need to get

241
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,680
proper images

242
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
proper uh memory dumps we need to

243
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
start looking at this in more detail

244
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,519
and and and we did so we started

245
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
uh increasing our accuracy

246
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,440
so that we could remove as much

247
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
uncertainty

248
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
as humanly possible we started uh

249
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,120
looking at this in the greater context

250
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,079
we started looking at uh what all of

251
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,680
this could mean we started looking at

252
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
whether or not

253
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,320
the uh ip address that this

254
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
string we can back to or this connection

255
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
was was speaking back to

256
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
uh could could be found out about

257
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,839
and and and we did find some things and

258
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,959
then i'm gonna

259
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,920
i'm gonna get back to that but but uh at

260
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
this point

261
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
in my story i feel like we need to take

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,360
a step back

263
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,760
and come back to to to to reality or

264
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,279
to to where we are now um having

265
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,040
been uh or having gone through the

266
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
pandemic like

267
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
all of you are having or being in the

268
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,760
midst of the

269
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,680
pandemic like like all of you we are

270
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,160
somewhere on the road to recover

271
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,720
and and there's been a lot of changes uh

272
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,519
in the world

273
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,880
uh during this uh past year and a half

274
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,519
or so

275
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
uh where we are

276
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
increasingly seeing uh

277
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
new ways of of working being

278
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
stabilized as the new

279
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
normal or the way forward as well i

280
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,600
don't think we will ever

281
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,639
go go back to the way way

282
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,160
it was are the way it were and in

283
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,680
by saying that i mean uh we need to look

284
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,240
at

285
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
how this has affected security as well

286
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
we need to look at

287
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,959
where we uh are uh in terms of what the

288
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,000
changes have have

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
been been done and and having uh an

290
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
increase in accurate

291
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
accuracy to remove uncertainty is

292
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
is is one of those ways of of better

293
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
understanding where we are now

294
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
and by that that i mean uh any sort of

295
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,600
measurement any sort of metrics

296
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
will uh give us a better understanding

297
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
of uh reality as it

298
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839
pertains to uh whatever situation we're

299
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,240
in

300
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
so i looked at um well

301
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,320
the information that is available to us

302
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,120
and

303
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
uh one of the main sources for for

304
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,680
good metrics good good quality data

305
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
for me has always been the verizon

306
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
database investigation report and i'm

307
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,399
sure

308
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,839
a lot of you have led or read the

309
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,560
2021 version it's been out for a while

310
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,199
but i figured i'd summarize some of the

311
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
findings some of the changes

312
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
that we have observed some of the uh

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,880
ways

314
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,279
where the world is

315
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,720
going or or how how these types of

316
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
breaches or how

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
how the type of breaches that that uh

318
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
this story is about

319
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,800
uh might have happened uh to other

320
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,399
companies as well

321
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,240
and if we look at this uh

322
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,680
graph or these two graphs and

323
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,519
i i think we have two very clear trends

324
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
two two very uh clear observations that

325
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,560
we can make

326
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,600
the first one is that uh

327
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
with a almost

328
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,160
um double uh

329
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,079
the number of uh incidents

330
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,880
to web application attacks we're seeing

331
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,519
denial of service attacks being utilized

332
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,160
or at least being uh labeled or

333
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,199
categorized as

334
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,480
incidents and and this

335
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,920
to me uh has has been reality for quite

336
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,040
a quite a while

337
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
but i think it's it's an interesting

338
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
metric it's an interesting

339
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,120
uh way of of observing or or

340
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
like understanding how uh

341
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
the threat landscape is

342
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
uh or what the transit landscape looks

343
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,600
like

344
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,920
most of the incidents the companies are

345
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
observing are related to denial of

346
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,720
service attacks

347
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
or uh at least uh

348
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,000
almost 50 now that's that's a lot

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,279
like one in two of your incidents

350
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,480
is a denial of service attack now

351
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,880
if if we go back to uh my story and and

352
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,560
uh we relate to to

353
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,639
the beginning of the thames

354
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,199
then uh denial of service attacks uh

355
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,320
were

356
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,199
maybe not as common uh but were a lot

357
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,240
more devastating

358
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,199
than they are today most uh denial of

359
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,320
service attacks

360
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,279
uh can be mitigated in this day and age

361
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,480
the other interesting uh aspect

362
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,360
of these two graphs uh is that social

363
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
engineering

364
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
is the largest

365
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,000
indicator or the largest single category

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,480
for uh breaches which

367
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,680
i think makes sense the

368
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,440
level of understanding the level of

369
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,160
knowledge we have about security is

370
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,279
leaps and bounds

371
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,560
uh beyond what it was ten years ago

372
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,199
where we're at a level where most uh

373
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,560
low-hanging fruit

374
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,959
uh are able to be be blocked we're a

375
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,480
level where most

376
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,959
uh companies are taking security

377
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,000
seriously enough

378
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
to to have

379
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
the the easiest ways at least blocked

380
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,120
where externally facing systems

381
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,480
are are no longer left

382
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,520
to rot at least for

383
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,839
for the majority of the systems

384
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,160
obviously the second largest thing

385
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,959
on on both is basic web application

386
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,599
attacks

387
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,959
uh but but still uh so

388
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,240
web uh social engineering uh is is the

389
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,119
majority

390
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,160
of of the things that are

391
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,240
uh impacting uh and attacking companies

392
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
and of uh those breaches

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,600
of those uh

394
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
incidents that we're seeing in companies

395
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,039
of those

396
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,200
uh situations where uh there are

397
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,720
clear losses to the companies that are

398
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,679
impacted

399
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,320
85 of them involve some human element

400
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,200
now uh

401
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,039
that that essentially means that that

402
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,320
we're

403
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,880
in a position where we need to get a lot

404
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,679
better

405
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,720
at training and educating uh

406
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,039
humans where we need to have a

407
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,879
better understanding and a better

408
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,280
grasp on what's driving humans to

409
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,400
to do the mistakes that they're doing

410
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,919
because 61 of the breaches

411
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,120
actually involve credentials now whether

412
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
or not that's credential reuse or

413
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,919
credential stalling through phishing is

414
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
not clear through this graph but

415
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,200
but the reality is the same the

416
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,919
attackers are using

417
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,360
uh and or reusing valid credentials

418
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,080
to breach these systems now some of this

419
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,520
could be mitigated with

420
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
two-factor authentication or or some

421
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,799
sort of veto

422
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,080
authentication setups which to be fair

423
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,760
uh there is no reason not to do anymore

424
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
like everybody has a smartphone in their

425
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,360
pockets

426
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,480
everybody is able to roll onto one of

427
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,559
these free authenticator setups even if

428
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
it's like google's authenticators or or

429
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,400
microsoft authenticators for for the

430
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,039
like uh one-time passwords you could

431
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
even use like hardware keys or

432
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,360
or whatever to to like greatly increase

433
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,320
the security

434
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,360
or in the organization so if we look at

435
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,280
these two graphs in

436
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,559
in part together if we look at

437
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,080
social engineering and basic web

438
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
application taxes being the majority

439
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,440
of of everything that is impacting

440
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,160
the system and we understand that 85 of

441
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,799
them

442
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,039
percent of these include humans and 61

443
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,240
of that is credential reuse then it's

444
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,760
really clear where we need to invest

445
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,360
where we need to

446
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,640
to uh push uh the narrative like what do

447
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,799
we need to stop from happening

448
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
i'm not saying we should stop uh looking

449
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
at uh

450
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,440
the technical aspects i'm not saying

451
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
that we should stop looking at

452
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,159
security testing as as like uh controls

453
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,600
i'm not saying that we should

454
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,559
uh stop actually doing anything of what

455
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,240
we're doing now i'm just saying that we

456
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,960
should

457
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
focus our efforts so focus focus our our

458
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,880
investments

459
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,640
on both training the

460
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,840
population or our employees our users

461
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,520
but also building compensating controls

462
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,559
for uh credential reuse

463
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,159
so uh that this doesn't allow

464
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,880
for uh the numbers uh that you see on

465
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
the right side

466
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,039
so we we're not in a situation where

467
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,520
where

468
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,280
uh the average uh losses for

469
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,799
for uh breaches are

470
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,000
uh are really well astronomical

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,960
essentially

472
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
in this day and age now there's

473
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,799
something else

474
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,280
that i find interesting uh and something

475
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,559
that is uniquely

476
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,159
or at least appears to be uh

477
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
quite heavily biased towards the trends

478
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,840
that we have now where we are uh

479
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
observing and looking

480
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,080
at what the world is doing and that's of

481
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,000
course ransomware

482
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and right now uh there's

483
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,360
a new new ransomware uh

484
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
hitting our new new compromise that's

485
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
hitting the news cycle but i want to

486
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,400
talk about

487
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,039
uh the colonial colonial uh shutdown

488
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,400
because

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,520
frankly i think it's an interesting

490
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
really interesting case for

491
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,679
uh what drives companies to

492
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,640
to actually pay ransom to to the

493
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,840
ransomware groups

494
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,440
now in colonial's case it's because they

495
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,159
couldn't figure out how to build their

496
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,039
systems

497
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,919
if they left the pipeline open so this

498
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,480
was purely a business decision they they

499
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
couldn't

500
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
uh figure out billing in the case of the

501
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,559
ransomware setup

502
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,159
so we have an attacker that is uh driven

503
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,200
by greed i suppose driven by money

504
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
launching a ransomware attack against

505
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,799
what appears to be

506
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,720
an unpatched exchange system which takes

507
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,200
over

508
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
the billing system of an oil oil

509
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,799
pipeline company

510
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,159
shuts down the billing operations for

511
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,400
inside company has nothing to do

512
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
with the ability for the company to

513
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,000
actually

514
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
provide this basic necessity for the

515
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,760
entire organization

516
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,240
that's only to do with their ability to

517
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,960
make money

518
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,280
so the ransomware gang is attacking

519
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
their ability to to make gunning

520
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
money whether or not darkseid did this

521
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,640
intentionally or not

522
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
is is uh up for debate but but i

523
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,840
i i think there's some level of irony

524
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
here and that led

525
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,000
to the company shutting down their

526
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
pipeline which in turn

527
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
led to people putting gasoline in

528
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,200
plastic bags

529
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
uh so so we have

530
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,039
a a ransomware gang operating in the

531
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,320
digital space

532
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,640
operating in in cyber space if you will

533
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
and their uh uh greed

534
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,600
led to a shutdown

535
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
in operations because of the greed of

536
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,679
the

537
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,799
pipeline company which read led to

538
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,520
a consumer product and safety commission

539
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,320
warning against not to fill plastic bags

540
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
with gasoline there was another picture

541
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,600
of

542
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
somebody guarding uh with what appeared

543
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,799
to be an assault rifle

544
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,320
uh somebody else pumping gas

545
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,440
and this this uh i think

546
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,720
is a perfect example of how real the

547
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,840
uh impact is of ransomware how how real

548
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,480
the impact is of of cyber crime where

549
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,600
where the bad guys uh cause

550
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,720
havoc on a systematic level

551
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,559
for an entire nation whether or not

552
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,320
that's entirely true

553
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,000
uh is is again up for debate i don't

554
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,559
have

555
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
the visibility into the us as some of

556
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
the talkers later today will will and

557
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,919
then they'll be able to

558
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,919
correct me if i'm wrong but at least

559
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,520
from our perspective

560
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,240
from our sheltered cold north if you

561
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
will

562
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,159
observing all of this madness going on

563
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,520
uh

564
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,279
gives us a glimpse at how bad it could

565
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:53,679
get

566
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
over here now consider for a moment

567
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,039
that a similar type of ransomware

568
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,799
attacks some of our critical

569
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,640
infrastructure now heating

570
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,360
would be the obvious choice right uh

571
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,320
energy would

572
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,559
would be another one that would cause

573
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,240
like mass panic

574
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,000
and uh a lot of people fleeing

575
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,640
to the countryside to where they can at

576
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,360
least

577
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
uh stay warm with wood uh and burning

578
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,240
stuff in in the fireplace

579
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,960
but but we're no longer uh living in a

580
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,520
world

581
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,440
where these things are separate and we

582
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,720
haven't been

583
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
for some time now there's this saying

584
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,360
uh in finland about uh

585
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,520
remembering uh the year 1995.

586
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,760
the reality of it is that 2045

587
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,360
is closer to us now than 1995

588
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,400
and even looking back

589
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,120
at where we were uh in in 19

590
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,720
uh in 2010 is a long ways

591
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,840
away from where we are today now

592
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,520
uh last graph before we get back to

593
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,080
our regularly scheduled programming

594
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,840
covet

595
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,919
has changed uh the type of activities

596
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,400
that that the attackers are doing they

597
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
have

598
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,240
actively moved to

599
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,279
increase their fishing

600
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,720
increase ransomware activities and

601
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,919
decrease their attacks on

602
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,279
misconfigurations or or publishing error

603
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,440
systems

604
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,799
there is a small increase on

605
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,559
on stalling credentials which

606
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,320
doesn't really make sense to me since

607
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,799
phishing is that much larger than it was

608
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,400
before

609
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,799
but i think this reflects the news cycle

610
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,400
i think this reflects what we've been

611
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,200
seeing

612
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,440
for for the last year like there's been

613
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,320
a new

614
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,760
leak almost every week there's been a a

615
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,039
new ransomware case uh if not every week

616
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,240
every other week

617
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,840
and there's been uh huge credential

618
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,720
dumps

619
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
and and sale of of uh

620
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,760
a really big amount of different data

621
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,200
sets

622
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,240
on different systems now uh

623
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,840
whether or not this will continue after

624
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,240
kaved is up again up for debate i don't

625
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,720
know

626
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,399
uh i hope uh that we get better at it

627
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
and i hope people aren't as gullible

628
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,240
anymore

629
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,000
but but this is at least uh

630
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,039
verizon's take on on where

631
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,159
uh the world is or was

632
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,559
and maybe there's something we can

633
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,880
understand from it

634
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,360
so uh one of the things

635
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,559
we might uh understand from it

636
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,840
uh and and

637
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,440
one of the things that i find

638
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,000
so intriguing about all of this is i

639
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
think we're starting to see

640
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,120
uh the

641
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,200
peak or the top of the iceberg

642
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
in terms of cascading compromises like

643
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,320
there was

644
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,600
this highly publicized uh solar winds

645
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,720
compromise

646
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,760
uh a while back

647
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
and and i think we're going to start

648
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,600
seeing more of that

649
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,760
i think we're going to start seeing

650
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,279
situations where

651
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,399
an upstream provider is going to

652
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,240
be compromised and all of that providers

653
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
customers and clientele base will be

654
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
compromised as well as those customers

655
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
so we're going to see these

656
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
uh cascading uh

657
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,760
faults problems errors just going

658
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,919
over like completely

659
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,440
crippling uh larger

660
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,480
organizations maybe even even

661
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,240
smaller nations or maybe even larger

662
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,279
nations to the point where

663
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,399
uh the barrier between the physical and

664
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,520
the digital

665
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,760
in terms of our safety not not only our

666
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
security but our safety

667
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,720
will start to come into question

668
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,919
and in if if we think about it

669
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,440
all signs points towards

670
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,039
this already being the case but the

671
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,200
larger failures or the larger

672
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,440
disasters that that uh are just waiting

673
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,080
to happen

674
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,080
are are just beyond the horizon or just

675
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,720
behind

676
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,760
the next corner i think

677
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,840
i can imagine a situation where

678
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,840
something like uh

679
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,120
a a widely used open source library

680
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,600
is compromised or

681
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,799
is actively contributed to and then

682
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,720
there is a a change

683
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,279
where they introduce something malicious

684
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,640
to it

685
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,840
and that then gets implemented in a lot

686
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,679
of other projects because they're just

687
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
blindly utilizing whatever code they're

688
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,679
getting from

689
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,880
a what appears to be a reputable source

690
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,919
now

691
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,840
i say i can imagine i don't really have

692
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,120
to imagine

693
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,559
this has been shown to happen before

694
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,320
this has been shown to be the reality

695
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,000
uh today but maybe

696
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,799
if i use my imagination if i think about

697
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,520
what

698
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,720
a potential outcome of this is

699
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,880
then maybe uh there's a

700
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,399
um next next solar winds

701
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,399
behind the horizon with a larger or a a

702
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,640
uh global reach something like an

703
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,559
operating system provider or a network

704
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,240
device provider maybe

705
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,840
some somebody like the

706
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,440
nokia networks or

707
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,720
or cisco uh where where we actually

708
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
start seeing

709
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,279
uh problems on on uh hardware level that

710
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:25,679
then

711
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,559
replicate into into the entire thing or

712
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,200
the

713
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,720
entire system like systematic uh

714
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,840
failure systematic uh

715
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,760
issues now now

716
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,720
now uh we're getting back uh and i got a

717
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,840
bit sidetracked

718
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,960
to be honest but i figured this

719
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,679
made sense in the middle of my story

720
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,480
because

721
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,080
contrasting all of that to where we were

722
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,640
uh somewhere back in 2010-ish

723
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,679
we're looking at this uh thing

724
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,519
this string this connection this beacon

725
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,320
that is

726
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,000
uh actively contacting somewhere

727
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,159
outside of our organization we're we're

728
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,279
investigating

729
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,360
we're looking at it where we're

730
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
intrigued where

731
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,080
uh we're in the

732
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,840
zone so to speak we're trying to to

733
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,640
keep our heads cool and we're trying to

734
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
keep keep

735
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,159
the angry men who are screaming into

736
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:32,799
phones

737
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,760
from from causing widespread panic

738
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,519
within the organization

739
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,679
and and on on some level we succeed

740
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
we we managed to tell them

741
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,760
to to give us a few more days

742
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,200
before they do anything drastic now yeah

743
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,679
well actually we got one day we asked

744
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,039
for a week

745
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,159
and and i think

746
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,200
uh they were

747
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,919
they were really

748
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,279
the the attackers were uh

749
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,960
not anticipating or not expecting us

750
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,000
to to uh do

751
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,360
uh the uh threat hunting to do

752
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,559
uh like log analyzers to do

753
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,159
do do these uh new types of behaviors

754
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,399
uh or at the time to us new types of

755
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,159
behaviors i mean

756
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,640
this maybe this is like old news to all

757
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,200
all of you but it wasn't to me back then

758
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,960
and and we were we were excited and we

759
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,000
were telling

760
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,519
telling uh the higher-ups about

761
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,200
how we we have now isolated

762
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,679
the systems how we made sure that that

763
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,240
we

764
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,279
we know that there's nobody or there's

765
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,080
nothing

766
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,200
uh that we aren't aware of uh they

767
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,000
haven't

768
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,399
uh done anything they they appear to

769
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,279
have just

770
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
set up this control channel they're not

771
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,200
actively utilizing it

772
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
uh there's there's just this like

773
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,399
beaconing home of it

774
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,000
and and the funny thing is

775
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,040
uh nobody at any point

776
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,159
asked uh about the attackers they were

777
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,280
interested

778
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
in the systems they were interested in

779
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,560
and what the potential

780
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,159
uh impact is and and like attribution

781
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,199
wasn't on the table

782
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,879
at any point however

783
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,079
we really wanted to know uh

784
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,599
what was going on and uh

785
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,119
and managed to trace this back to a

786
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,159
uh university network

787
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,599
in in uh well

788
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,080
let's say asia so it doesn't

789
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,399
[Music]

790
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,920
pinpoint it too clearly and and

791
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,520
uh doing more research

792
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,000
we found a a

793
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,440
published master's thesis

794
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,520
about how to use

795
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,440
pivoting techniques or not pivoting

796
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,880
techniques how to use

797
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,000
uh like certain types of

798
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,040
techniques to gain access to

799
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,200
a nordic institution

800
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,240
it published on this university website

801
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,920
by by these these students this was a

802
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,599
a uh setup

803
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,240
where where they were explaining uh how

804
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,040
weaknesses

805
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,320
in certain web applications are able to

806
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,119
be utilized

807
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,010
to

808
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,240
[Music]

809
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,160
upload code which will then beacon home

810
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,480
and they had done this to a number of

811
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,760
organizations and

812
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,800
and our organization was one of these

813
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
organizations

814
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,680
now the amount of of laughter

815
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,280
i had with the team

816
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,640
about and about this when when we

817
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,359
figured this out

818
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,920
is probably not appropriate uh

819
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,040
considering

820
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,640
the uh gravity of the situation but

821
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,839
at the same time uh

822
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,520
the relief we felt

823
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,720
when we found our uh address space and

824
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,880
we found our

825
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,160
our our uh organization's uh

826
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,440
interest in this master thesis uh was

827
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,480
was quite large because this wasn't a

828
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,520
sophisticated nation nation state uh or

829
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,599
at least didn't appear to be allowed

830
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,079
uh this wasn't a malicious type of

831
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,560
compromise this was purely

832
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,079
for educational reasons from

833
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
a country where our

834
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,880
university where i suppose uh ethics

835
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,920
are considered a bit differently uh in

836
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,599
these types of things now uh

837
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,240
having having said that uh

838
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,920
and in tying this uh

839
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,240
somewhat together not all together but

840
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,480
somewhat together

841
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,599
having a

842
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,960
a education facility

843
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,880
uh impose learning on this

844
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,400
organization was quite quite interesting

845
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,599
and the things

846
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,760
the organization learned were not

847
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,520
necessarily the things

848
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,320
um we would have hoped the organization

849
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,680
learned

850
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,879
they were uh

851
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,599
the the thing the organization learned

852
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,760
was that they need to hire more security

853
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,640
people which i

854
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,839
i mean that was a good uh good call

855
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,359
uh they need to introduce larger log

856
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,720
retention times

857
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,200
and they need to have active

858
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,960
[Music]

859
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,720
counter measures against

860
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,640
the identified issues again i

861
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,000
i really wish uh or i really wish i was

862
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,760
braver and and could talk in more

863
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
specifics uh

864
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,560
but my imagination isn't isn't good

865
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,040
enough

866
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,359
to to think of all all the details

867
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,640
the the thing i i think

868
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,760
we should have learned is

869
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,280
is that from the get-go

870
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,800
uh all assumptions everything we have

871
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,079
everything we think about in terms of

872
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,040
what an attacker might be and what they

873
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,599
might be

874
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,119
uh uh out for

875
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,320
is is completely different from

876
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,200
from what the reality is and and i think

877
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,240
we should

878
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,359
drop uh our assumptions and start

879
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,040
looking at facts and start looking at

880
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
uh the information and the metrics that

881
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,320
are available to us

882
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,000
start understanding that

883
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800
uh there's a lot of stuff a lot of

884
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,000
things a lot of

885
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
um undefined uh

886
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,160
reality that needs to be defined and

887
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
needs to be better understood

888
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,960
and and we need to start teaching

889
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,240
we need to start uh

890
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,800
explaining and expressing and

891
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,599
taking home all the learnings that we

892
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,720
have

893
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,960
and contextualizing that for our

894
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,839
audience

895
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,480
for the people who are willing to listen

896
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,440
to us

897
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,720
uh explain who are willing to

898
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,000
to learn from us and i think

899
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,200
uh a lot of a lot of us

900
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,720
are forgetting that things

901
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,160
that we find as trivial things

902
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,319
we find as

903
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,760
uh like uh obvious aren't that to most

904
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,440
people

905
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,720
most people in this community are leaps

906
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,839
and bounds

907
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,520
beyond uh the average person in terms of

908
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,319
understanding the threats

909
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,280
most people in this community know a lot

910
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,240
more

911
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,920
than they think they do most of you

912
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,200
i i'm willing to wager all of you

913
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,319
know something that i don't know

914
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,119
and you can teach me a lot of stuff but

915
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,319
you can teach

916
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,880
everybody else a lot of things as well

917
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,520
and and

918
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,160
we should be

919
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,240
proud uh of of our knowledge and we

920
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,040
should

921
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,560
stand uh on the shoulders of our

922
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,520
teachers

923
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,960
uh and our our educators

924
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,240
and uh proudly proclaim

925
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
the knowledge that we have to make sure

926
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,520
that the people

927
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,079
that are coming after us uh will have it

928
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,280
easier

929
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,119
that we don't end up in a situation

930
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,480
where uh

931
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,720
we make it harder for people that need

932
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,760
help

933
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,599
because we don't have to uh and

934
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,040
we really really shouldn't

935
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,240
that's uh that's that's my

936
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,359
my thing um my presentation

937
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,400
um i i hope it made some sense

938
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,200
to to some of you uh and i'm

939
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,680
i'm interested in in

940
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,000
whether or not you have any questions

941
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,040
for for me

942
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,480
okay thank you benjamin um i indeed we

943
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,119
have a

944
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,160
question some questions here and i'll

945
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,800
just

946
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,920
uh shoot them right out so what's your

947
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,800
take on pyden's executive order due to

948
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,000
the colonial pipeline ransomware attack

949
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,119
such as the mandate for software

950
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,319
bill of materials

951
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,000
wow um like you want me to go into

952
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,040
geopolitics i am not a geopolitic

953
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,079
expert i don't feel

954
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,520
qualified in commenting on on

955
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,920
uh on on my wideness executive orders

956
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,000
what i will say however

957
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,359
is that there is a very real

958
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,680
uh wake up that is happening in terms of

959
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
this and i think ransomware

960
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,160
has done more uh to raise awareness for

961
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,319
information security and cyber security

962
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,040
than any information security specialist

963
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,920
has done

964
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,119
uh overall it's been the best

965
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,240
awareness program uh that has happened

966
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,760
in a like number of years multitude of

967
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,640
years

968
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,760
uh and and the fact that we have

969
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,680
uh the president president of the united

970
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,880
states uh

971
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,920
actually making executive orders

972
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,119
on cyber security because of ransomware

973
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,119
uh is a testament of that fact

974
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,319
okay so the next one would be what would

975
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:26,960
you say

976
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,520
are the top three challenges when it

977
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,599
comes to preventing data leaks

978
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,240
and breaches

979
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,839
top three challenges a credential reuse

980
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,520
is probably the largest one

981
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,760
uh using your the same username and

982
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,960
password on

983
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,680
a lot of different services uh

984
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,680
but so so then that would

985
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,319
imply that awareness about credential

986
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,200
reuse

987
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,720
would be the the like top challenge uh

988
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,680
number two is probably uh executive

989
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,319
buy-in

990
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,880
on on uh like in terms of security

991
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,599
a lot of executives are saying that they

992
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:11,920
uh

993
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,079
take this seriously but then when they

994
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,200
are uh

995
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,359
forced to spend money they stop taking

996
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,319
it seriously

997
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,240
which actually means that they don't

998
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,920
really or that you don't really have

999
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,040
executive buy-in

1000
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,119
and i think that leads to the number

1001
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,480
three reason which is

1002
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,599
uh that cyber security specialists are

1003
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,640
historically

1004
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,920
terrible at contextualizing what the

1005
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,880
risks are

1006
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,800
for the organization on an

1007
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,160
organizational level

1008
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,599
we tend to immediately dive into

1009
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,760
technical details and technical aspects

1010
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,920
of whatever the issue is

1011
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,359
which immediately stops most executives

1012
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,560
from listening

1013
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,160
we need to start learning

1014
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,280
or and start working on contextualizing

1015
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,440
threats and contextualizing risks

1016
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,280
in terms of business

1017
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,119
losses and actually put numbers to it

1018
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,839
and have some sort of confidence uh

1019
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,720
intervals

1020
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,920
uh in terms of of saying

1021
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,599
explaining what what those things are

1022
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,079
okay but i have one more question for

1023
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:20,800
you

1024
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,440
which is uh will the electric crate be

1025
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,240
taken down

1026
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,319
by a targeted attack or by mistake a

1027
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,880
as a collateral damage

1028
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,200
yes

1029
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,240
yes yes i'm pretty sure it'll happen

1030
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,160
and it already has if you look at the

1031
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,839
black energy campaign that hit ukraine

1032
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,119
uh then uh i think

1033
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,640
it's very clear uh that when

1034
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,359
we are in an active military conflict

1035
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,119
nation states will attack

1036
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,280
uh the uh

1037
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,000
the critical infrastructure of a nation

1038
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,319
uh

1039
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,520
and in the case of the black energy uh

1040
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,760
set up there isn't uh i think there was

1041
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,720
like uh

1042
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,960
hundreds of thousands of people who were

1043
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,160
without power

1044
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,560
uh for a longer duration of time

1045
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,920
okay uh we got one more question if it's

1046
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,720
okay for you

1047
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,440
so can infosec professionals really stay

1048
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,160
out of the

1049
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,839
geopolitics no absolutely not and not

1050
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,599
stay out of politics either

1051
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,599
and not stay out of ethics we have a

1052
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,079
responsibility

1053
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,200
uh as people who are both

1054
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,760
in positions of influence and power but

1055
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,560
also

1056
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,680
in positions of actually developing

1057
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,680
uh tooling and and uh like uh

1058
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,119
software to uh make sure

1059
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,400
that we have a clear moral compass that

1060
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,680
we follow

1061
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,800
and do

1062
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,079
don't uh continue doing things

1063
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,240
that we uh don't feel is right or is

1064
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:12,960
ethical

1065
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,760
having said that not everyone has the

1066
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,400
choice

1067
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,160
to not just stop working uh not just

1068
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,319
uh uh like uh and i think we should

1069
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,680
make it our utmost priority to uh

1070
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,000
give opportunities to people who need to

1071
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,359
get out of a situation

1072
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,480
where they are stuck and

1073
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,040
need to do things that is against their

1074
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,079
own conscience

1075
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,720
uh because of them not having any other

1076
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,440
option

1077
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,520
uh we are ridiculously privileged

1078
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,599
uh uh in in in so many different ways

1079
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,280
uh and if we uh

1080
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,920
stop thinking about how easy it is for

1081
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,400
us

1082
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,440
and have empathy for people who are in a

1083
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,319
significantly harder position uh then we

1084
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,200
will realize

1085
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,680
that uh we don't really have the moral

1086
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,359
high ground to tell other people how

1087
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,559
they should be doing their

1088
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,960
thing thing or how they should be living

1089
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,079
uh

1090
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,119
and and uh we need to uh support

1091
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,640
people uh who uh with the decisions

1092
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,760
they're doing

1093
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,480
and support our community with

1094
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,680
with the ability to move away from

1095
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:34,240
unethical practices

1096
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,160
thank you for the questions and i think

1097
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,599
we can now have

1098
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,040
a short answers and questions

1099
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,000
and i'm hoping we could have the next

1100
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,800
short break

1101
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,040
and then we can continue with the next
