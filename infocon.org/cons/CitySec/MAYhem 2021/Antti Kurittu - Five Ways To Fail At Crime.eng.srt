[Music]

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:25,920
hello

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
oh thank you benjamin i'm sorry i didn't

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
listen to your whole talk but i'm sure

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
it was excellent

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,920
so now it's time to talk a little bit

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,399
about

9
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,440
cyber criminals not so much about cyber

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,040
crimes although i have

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,239
five examples of how they have failed

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,640
and i'll tell you all about it but first

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,920
a couple of

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,039
things about me so for those of you who

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,840
don't know me

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,320
my name is anti correcto i currently

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,879
work

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,039
as the digital forensics and incident

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
response team leader nixo

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,039
and here's my short cv so to speak

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,840
a short background so i started about 10

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
years ago at the helsinki police

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,799
department

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,360
as a junior constable and then a senior

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,720
detective constable

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,240
doing ict crime investigations

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
it was 10 years ago so they didn't

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
really talk about cyber crime

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
investigations at that time it was

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
ict also arctic or in finnish although

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,880
they call it

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,680
the other technique so that's where i

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
got my

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,000
my first and actually my best best

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
understanding of what kind of people

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,119
commit

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,040
what we now call cyber crimes

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,200
so from there i moved to traffic on

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,439
ncscfi the national cyber security

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,200
center of finland and worked as a

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
security specialist for a couple of

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,399
years

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,439
in that role it wasn't so much

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,079
investigating cases as it was more about

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,520
understanding the

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
mechanics behind them and the technology

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,119
and what's happening

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,479
in in these cases when

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,598
the police perspective is who did it and

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
the ncscfi

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
perspective is rather what happened and

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
what does this mean

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
so after a few years with the national

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
cyber security center

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
a detective sergeant position opened up

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
in the helsinki police department

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,480
so i decided to join back there so i got

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,200
the job

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
and i went back to my old unit doing

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,560
some

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
cybercrime investigations again and ict

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,400
crime investigations and uh one thing to

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
say about that is that when when the

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
police

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,480
investigate computer crime it's not just

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
cyber crime as we understand it it's

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
more about

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
how technology relates to other crime

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,720
and doing forensics for

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,519
all kinds of stuff so i had to i had the

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
possibility to join all kinds of

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,920
investigations like violent crime and

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
and well everything you can think about

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,760
if there's a phone or a computer

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,640
involved then

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
well it's the ict guys who might get

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
involved in that

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
but after spending some time there i

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
decided

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
that i i was happier at the ncscfi

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,599
the work was different than it was a bit

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,959
more

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
let's say forward looking with better

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,879
possibilities for my career so i

85
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,159
rejoined and

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,640
worked with cyber exercises for a few

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,599
years

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,440
and a year and a half ago i joined nixo

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,239
as an evil capitalist and started to

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,319
lead the dfir team there

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,720
so i'm back at investigating cases

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
but now the level of abstraction is

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,319
different i don't

94
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,720
investigate cases with technical tools

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,760
rather i have a

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,159
team of great people who do the

97
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
investigations and i get to be a part of

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,760
that and that's a real

99
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,280
joy and privilege in my life

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,879
but i wanted to talk about criminals

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,080
as people just because i've

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,439
met a bunch and i i think

103
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,519
the unique perspective that you get from

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,439
policing is that you actually get to

105
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,680
meet people who would be classified as

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,120
cyber criminals

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,680
because most security professionals we

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
have this

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,680
we have a thick layer between us and the

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
uh the bad actors when i don't like that

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
term if it's ben affleck during the

112
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
crime then i can call him a bad actor

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,759
but i like to talk about criminals

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,440
because i i like to see them as

115
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
criminals and threat actor or bad actor

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,320
just

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,759
doesn't sound very good to me we get to

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,080
see those people and speak with them and

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,160
kind of try to understand what makes

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,520
them tick and

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
and and i have a different perspective

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
on all of this and this is something i'd

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
like to share here

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
so when we're talking about cyber

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
criminals we of course have

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
different tiers there we have the

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
nation's state threat actor

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,720
uh level of people who sometimes get

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,759
indicted by the us supreme court and

130
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,960
named and shamed in

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,800
fbi affidavits and these are

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520
are say the highest echelon of these

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,320
people

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
than these criminals and some of them

135
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
work for spy

136
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
agencies and some of them are just

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
high-level organized crime

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,400
well-resourced and well-trained and

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
working a

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
nine-to-five job doing cyber crime

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,600
so there has been some talk

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
about what is the difference between

143
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
cyber criminals and

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,800
and these nation-state people it seems

145
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
at least in russia

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
it's it's kind of hard to tell the

147
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,199
difference so is evil corp actually

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,840
an extension of the spying apparatus

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,320
there

150
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,360
or is it working under its auspices or

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000
does it actually have have government

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,039
funding

153
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,919
it's hard to say we don't know at least

154
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,960
it's

155
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,039
it seems that most of the damage is

156
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
happening somewhere else than

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
than the countries that are being

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
suspected of harboring these criminals

159
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
well that's that's all i'm good and

160
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
those those guys get a lot of press and

161
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,759
a lot of in

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,440
interest in them but i'd say that they

163
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,600
are a very small percent of the actual

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,000
cyber

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
criminals out there the people who do

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,039
the the bulk of the crime and most of

167
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,560
the crime

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
i think the medium skilled criminals are

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
a bit of a bigger problem because we

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,880
have we have

171
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
an economy here of course and the medium

172
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
skilled criminals are

173
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
are the initial access brokers who are

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
the people who

175
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,039
get access to organizations and then

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
sell that access to somebody else

177
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,240
we have the scammers and fishers and all

178
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,440
of these people who make money

179
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,319
not with sophisticated malware or or

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
long campaigns but rather just

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,199
abusing our trust and reliance on

182
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,360
computing equipment

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,240
i'd say that back scammers and uh ceo

184
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,840
fraud people and all of these these are

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
cyber criminals but they're medium

186
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
skilled at best

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
if even that and then we have the large

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
bulk of these low-skilled criminals

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
and the thing is that these low-skilled

190
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,080
criminals might be

191
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
actually low-skilled only in the tech

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
part of the thing

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,319
but they are quite skilled as criminals

194
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
which makes them

195
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
a bit more difficult to catch because

196
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
they might be

197
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
let's say organized crime that realizes

198
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
that it's better

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
to do ransomware than to sell drugs and

200
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039
then they pivot to that so they come

201
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,720
from this criminal background and this

202
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
mindset

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,080
and not not from the black hat hacking

204
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,039
community

205
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
but they will find each other and these

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,319
low-skilled people

207
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
are buying services from the medium and

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
high-level skills

209
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,599
skilled people to do crime and of course

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,440
we have the low skilled hackers there

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,160
also

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,400
the people who are doing the tedious job

213
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,639
but this is what we usually see when

214
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,160
somebody gets breached

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
they say that we were breached by a

216
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
highly skilled adversary

217
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,319
and judging by the amount of these

218
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,919
headlines that i see when

219
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
companies get reached it seems like

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
there are only highly skilled

221
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
adversaries there

222
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,440
and it only takes a highly skilled

223
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
adversary for any company to fall

224
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
well in my experience

225
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
most attacks that result in problems are

226
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,039
not

227
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
done by highly skilled adversaries

228
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
they're done by mostly medium skilled or

229
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,880
low-skilled adversaries using

230
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,880
an economy of mistakes and purchasing

231
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
different services from each other

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,720
for example you buy initial access from

233
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
an initial access broker

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
you buy your malware you ran some

235
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
software from somebody else

236
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
and then you go in and you install the

237
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
ransom software and then you try

238
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
to get the ransom none of these people

239
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
is highly skilled

240
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
possibly the person who has programmed

241
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
the actual ransomware

242
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,080
but not even necessarily them

243
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
it doesn't really sound like such a

244
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,120
complicated software program

245
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
to write a program that encrypts files

246
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,800
but this is of course the line and this

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
this is kind of

248
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,839
um this is selling the life

249
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,600
of the high high level cyber criminal

250
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,399
to other aspiring cyber criminals which

251
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:34,800
is

252
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
sort of weird to me that they are they

253
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
are kind of banging the drama

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
and i was wondering because uh these apt

255
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
groups get all these cool names and

256
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
they've changed now that they are using

257
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,279
unc

258
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,920
and then a number or an apt and a number

259
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
but whenever i hear

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
some some apd group being attributed

261
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
with a really cool name

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
it just sounds like a sneaker added to

263
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
me just join us this is the glamorous

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
life

265
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
but the fact is that a life of crime is

266
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
not really that glamorous it's not

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
champagne and private jets it's it's

268
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,360
it's more about being worried and and

269
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
checking over your shoulder i'm not sure

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
if you guys saw

271
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,360
the pictures of the motet guys apartment

272
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
and when they did the home search there

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
i don't have copyrighted those images so

274
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
i don't have them there

275
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,519
here but the state

276
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
of the apartment of those people who

277
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
were running one of the most dangerous

278
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,120
malware networks in the world was just

279
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
it was just sad it was like a teenage

280
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,240
boy's house

281
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,720
and it looked like like nobody who is

282
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,640
actually doing well in life lives

283
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,680
under those circumstances there was just

284
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
a big peak into the into the

285
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,760
life of the criminal of course there are

286
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
there are differences here but but i'd

287
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
say that most of the common crime

288
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,839
is really drudgeries and we have

289
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,240
actually stats to back this up and

290
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,079
we have um sorry i'm at lost

291
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,160
with words here we have a a case study

292
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
where they interview people who had

293
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
stopped cyber crime

294
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
a lot of them said that it's the reason

295
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
they stopped is because it got so boring

296
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
but the jet jet jet set lifestyle of the

297
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
star hacker or the criminal kingpin

298
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,320
really wasn't what it actually was

299
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,959
and now that cybercrime has gotten so

300
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,760
big

301
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,240
and there's so much of it it has really

302
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
built its own economy

303
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
and where you have economy you have

304
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
tiering of jobs

305
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
and then you have the fast food clerk

306
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,720
jobs

307
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
and then you have the ceo jobs and then

308
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,079
you have the millionaire entrepreneur

309
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,040
jobs there

310
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,320
but as we know from common

311
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
experience with life is that we have a

312
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
lot more of those tedious jobs

313
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
these low fulfillment jobs that we have

314
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
the upper hierarchy

315
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
interesting jobs so it just seems that

316
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
for a lot of cyber criminals these days

317
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
it's a quite a

318
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
quite a situation when they realize that

319
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,560
they're actually

320
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
their cool life of hacking is resembling

321
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,959
a help desk job more than

322
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,600
than being something charismatic and

323
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
being a deviant

324
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
and that's that is a way out for a lot

325
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
of these people from cyber crime

326
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,360
and it's starting to resemble

327
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
low-level work in drug dealing gangs

328
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,399
which is

329
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
a good way to put it of course drug

330
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,959
dealing gangs often victimize people who

331
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,600
have no

332
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
other options and i'm sure a lot of

333
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,360
cyber crime

334
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
especially internationally is coming

335
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,519
from the same situation that you don't

336
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,760
really have that much options

337
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
in a poor country for example and

338
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,200
somebody offers you

339
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,839
a nice clean way to make a lot of money

340
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,320
without

341
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
risking your body so they start working

342
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
for some higher up cyber criminal and

343
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,600
they too do

344
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
a lot of tedious work for a small amount

345
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
of money

346
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
so what does this have to do with

347
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,519
failing well

348
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
the thing is the more cyber crime looks

349
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,680
like

350
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,399
a job and more it looks like just

351
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:18,880
running

352
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,519
a business the more likely of course is

353
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,200
that people are starting to get

354
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,839
burned out by it and being burned out

355
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,440
burnt out means that

356
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,839
you start making mistakes and when you

357
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,279
think about

358
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
cyber crime service let's say that

359
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
you're providing a booter

360
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,920
for example a ddos stressing service

361
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,240
the things you need to do is you have to

362
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
have marketing

363
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,920
of course people need to know about your

364
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,279
product on service

365
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,360
you need to have systems administration

366
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,880
of course you have infrastructure that

367
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
you have to keep up to date

368
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,279
there's maintenance there's accounting

369
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,959
you send out invoices

370
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,360
and then you get paid you have to design

371
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,959
your service you have to design your

372
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,480
system you have to

373
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,600
get your bots somewhere and and you have

374
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
to respond to sales queries you have

375
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,079
customer service then you have bug fixes

376
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,839
updates and patching

377
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
so a lot of this list to me sounds quite

378
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,160
a familiar it's

379
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
just like okay are you describing just

380
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
having a job

381
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
well no the other part is that

382
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,959
when you have a job you don't have all

383
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,959
the extra worries that criminals have

384
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:29,279
like

385
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,600
operational security and not getting

386
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
scammed by

387
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,920
other criminals because if you're

388
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
dealing with criminals well

389
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
there's no such thing as honor among

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
thieves that's just

391
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,040
that's just a joke it's not

392
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,440
actually even remotely true then you

393
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
have to worry about

394
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
law enforcement and the authorities you

395
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,079
need to find reliable

396
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,279
partners where you're going to find

397
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,360
those on the internet

398
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,240
sure okay but are they reliable and how

399
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,360
reliable

400
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,880
and where do you find your reliable

401
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
customers so you have all these issues

402
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,079
and the only plus side is that you don't

403
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,839
have to pay taxes and you get to do

404
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,839
something that's not

405
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,360
possibly permitted by law so maybe just

406
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,240
start a company

407
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
well there's a couple of points here

408
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
that i want to make and

409
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,240
and this will help you probably

410
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
understand the life of the common

411
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
criminal a bit

412
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,920
better crime really isn't glamorous

413
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,480
what we see on tv that's not what i saw

414
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
when i was working with the police

415
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
most of those criminals they weren't

416
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
they weren't the charismatic mafiosos

417
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
that you see on tv they were just people

418
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
who made a lot of bad mistakes and some

419
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
of those people were just

420
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
well it's hard to describe them as

421
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,880
anything else than evil but that's not

422
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,920
very very trendy now right now to set

423
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
things in those terms but

424
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,959
most of most of them had at least made

425
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,519
serious mistakes in their life they had

426
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,639
issues like drug

427
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,880
problems and alcohol issues and problems

428
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,399
with their family and

429
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,800
and the life of crime kind of maybe

430
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
chose them more than

431
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
they chose it and of course

432
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,160
operational security well they say it's

433
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,639
hard

434
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,360
but i think it's impossible it's

435
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,880
because the thing with operational

436
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
security is that you have to do it

437
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,199
perfectly

438
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,040
because you it's just you can't have

439
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
acid it's not opsec if you have

440
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
acid it's just partial optic and that

441
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,320
that doesn't really work

442
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,320
and everybody makes mistakes and that is

443
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,079
i think this is this is the biggest

444
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,519
point of this talk and i

445
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,240
wanted to talk about this and i hope

446
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
you'll bear with me because this is the

447
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,279
first time i've been presenting these

448
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,959
slides or even talking about these

449
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
issues here in public so first of all i

450
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:50,800
have no idea

451
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,279
how my timing is and if these stories

452
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,480
are even interesting but

453
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,160
each of them is uh is a good example of

454
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,480
how real life criminals actually make

455
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
mistakes that cause them

456
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
to get caught

457
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,119
and of course these stories are not

458
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
advice for criminals

459
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,959
these are these are not to be taken as

460
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,039
okay they'll just check that box and

461
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,880
check this box and now i'll be

462
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
safe i'm trying to represent them as a

463
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,959
hopeful message because

464
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,359
often when we're dealing with cyber

465
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,880
crime

466
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
nobody even really takes seriously the

467
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
idea of

468
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
these ransomware people getting caught

469
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,840
for example

470
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,280
like the dark side gang or or evil corp

471
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,240
or any of these it's just um it's like

472
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,080
it's like the dark side of the force

473
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
it's just always there and it's causing

474
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,919
problems but nobody is really expecting

475
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,880
to see anybody in handcuffs or in jail

476
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
but these are examples that didn't

477
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,360
really make the papers

478
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,160
at least just maybe a small news

479
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,280
somewhere

480
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,200
i'm not telling you any details about

481
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
the people involved

482
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,960
and no no sentencing details or anything

483
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,080
like that

484
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,520
i'll just give you the gist of the case

485
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,039
and all of these are based on true

486
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,120
stories they're not necessarily my

487
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
investigations and i want you all to

488
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,960
remember that

489
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
all it takes is one mistake and that one

490
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
mistake is usually enough

491
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,880
to get caught and that's that's the fail

492
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,679
in this crime

493
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
so number five i'm counting down from

494
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,679
five to one

495
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
so there was this uh case

496
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,480
where mr a was reading the email of his

497
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,520
own lawyer

498
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,679
who was settling a dispute between him

499
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,880
and mr b

500
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
and these guys were business partners

501
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,160
and they were having some

502
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,559
problems and they had hired this lawyer

503
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,440
to help them

504
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
settle the score and then draft some

505
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
kind of an exit agreement or something

506
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,440
like that

507
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,600
the thing was that this company was also

508
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
providing the email services for the

509
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,320
lawyer

510
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
so mr a and probably mr b

511
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
knew the lawyer's email's password

512
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,559
because

513
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,919
he was a typical typical person which

514
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,240
by which i mean he knew not much about

515
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,000
computers and when he had computer

516
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,960
issues

517
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
he brought the computer to mr a who

518
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
gladly fixed it for him

519
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,120
and for that purpose he had given him

520
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
his email password

521
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
okay well that's that's a fail on itself

522
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,559
but then again

523
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,440
people trust people especially people

524
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,919
that

525
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,799
hire you to help them so he really

526
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
didn't think about it that much

527
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,360
but one time the lawyer noticed that he

528
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
had a sent message

529
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
in his trash can his trash folder and he

530
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
was wondering that he hasn't sent this

531
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,840
message

532
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,039
and it was sent to mr a and it

533
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,600
included some details of the case that

534
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
the lawyer was mediating

535
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080
because he was having confidential

536
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,400
discussions with both mr a and mr b

537
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,080
trying to reach some kind of an

538
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
agreement so it was

539
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
supposed to be a neutral party but mr a

540
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
had decided to tip the scales in his

541
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
favor

542
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,600
but he wasn't much of a cyber criminal

543
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,679
so he just sent himself a message

544
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
instead of doing something else and then

545
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
forgot to delete it from the send folder

546
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
actually he deleted from the send folder

547
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,919
but forgot to

548
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,640
remove it from the trash folder so the

549
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
lawyer called the police and

550
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,320
the case was investigated

551
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,720
so we went to arrest mr a

552
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,440
just to have him on the police station

553
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,240
and make some

554
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,559
queries because this was actually quite

555
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,159
a big case

556
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
and we just missed him he was

557
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,520
he was not at home in the morning when

558
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,120
the police went there

559
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
but his wife was at home so he was she

560
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,360
was informed that the police would like

561
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,280
to speak with your husband

562
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
but we went to the office to find the

563
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,400
guy and he came there by taxi

564
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,720
so we found a systems admin there and

565
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,640
told him that we need some log files and

566
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
we need this and this and these logs and

567
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,480
here's the usb drive so please

568
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
get copying and and the systems admin

569
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,559
gave me the logs and i

570
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,360
threw them into splunk and started

571
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
seeing the connections

572
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
so we saw that the mr a had connected

573
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
from his home ip through vpn

574
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,120
to a laptop over rdp at the company

575
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,919
premises

576
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,280
and used that laptop to take a connect

577
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
the webmail session

578
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
to an on-premises exchange using outlook

579
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
web access

580
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,720
and use that to go to the lawyer's inbox

581
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,760
and then

582
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,880
send the messages to him so i was able

583
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
to parse this together

584
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
from the logs but we didn't have that

585
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,679
laptop

586
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,760
so we were kind of out of luck because

587
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
we are well basically

588
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
we didn't have the so-called murder

589
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,320
weapon

590
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,520
i was sitting in the sauna with my

591
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,320
family and just

592
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,159
deep in thought and then just kind of

593
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,159
dawned on me that

594
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,400
we should probably check the car that he

595
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
took

596
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,320
for repairs because his wife probably

597
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,919
called him

598
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,960
and that's where we found the laptop and

599
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,320
that was

600
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,679
that was a quite a quite a good example

601
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,280
of how people think

602
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,679
because if you do crimes serious crimes

603
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,440
and you have a laptop and the police

604
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,960
don't have it yet

605
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,679
you have several options there one of

606
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,760
the worst options is to just stick it

607
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,440
under the floor mat of your car

608
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,320
this is a actually a recreation of the

609
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,520
situation because

610
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,080
i didn't have the original photo here

611
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,440
with me of course

612
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
but i i did have a car and laptop so i

613
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,280
just

614
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
recreated where it was so

615
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,039
here's a pretty bad failure just getting

616
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,360
attached to hardware

617
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,720
and not not being able to to let go or

618
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
even think further

619
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
not to mention the other operational

620
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
security failures

621
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
that they were happening before

622
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,440
so we did a forensic investigation of

623
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
the unencrypted laptop of course it was

624
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
unencrypted this was years ago and then

625
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,080
well encryption wasn't standard and so

626
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
that it was used to access the inbox so

627
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,919
we had the full chain of logs

628
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,280
implicating

629
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,600
him so that was that and that was a

630
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,559
fail number five

631
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,120
this was different this was really

632
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,039
this is a case that i keep coming back

633
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,039
to in my mind every once in a while when

634
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,760
i think about

635
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,520
pathological male behavior towards

636
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,720
towards women and the world in general

637
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,840
and it just kind of

638
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,919
kind of just stuck with me for some

639
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,360
reason

640
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,000
and there was this suspect this this guy

641
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,400
and he was investigated for stalking his

642
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,279
ex-girlfriend and he had been slightly

643
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,320
violent

644
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,559
against her they they had an argument

645
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,400
and he had grabbed her by the shoulders

646
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
causing bruises and

647
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,120
and uh she was filing a report about

648
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,840
that

649
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,640
assault i think it's i'm not sure

650
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,559
it's probably minor assault or something

651
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,320
like this in english

652
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,200
and the case was being investigated by

653
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,720
by somebody i knew from the police

654
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
station and she just came

655
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,520
up to me and said that my my victim here

656
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,279
is saying that this stalker

657
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,159
has accessed her facebook account so is

658
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,279
that illegal

659
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,039
i was like [ __ ] yeah it's illegal it's

660
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,960
that's uh computer breaking and

661
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,240
it's two years or or a fine so

662
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,279
it's actually quite a serious crime

663
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,200
and he was also messing with her email

664
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,559
so i said let's

665
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
let's go and pay him a visit and i'll

666
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,480
i'll grab his computer and see what he's

667
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
been up to

668
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,360
so we went to the suspect's home

669
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,240
where he had a desktop computer this was

670
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,279
years ago so

671
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
we used to have desktop computers i'm

672
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,960
not sure if you remember it's about a

673
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,440
box

674
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,120
about this size and the funny thing is

675
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,640
doesn't have a keyboard

676
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,279
or a screen attached to it they are

677
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,880
separate and you buy them separately

678
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
like the ones you have on your laptop at

679
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,440
home

680
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,440
but he had one of those and

681
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,760
he was kind of a out of his luck guy he

682
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
didn't really have a job or a place of

683
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,799
his own so this was

684
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,520
actually his parents place and when they

685
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,480
were dating

686
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,440
he had dragged that box to his

687
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
girlfriend's place where they both used

688
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,799
the computer

689
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,880
and then they broke up and he left and

690
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,559
he stayed away for a couple of months

691
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,400
and then he came and

692
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,320
and got the computer back

693
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,360
well we got the computer at the police

694
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
station and i did a

695
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,039
image of it and started started doing

696
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
some forensics within case

697
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,000
just trying to see what's going on and

698
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,039
maybe find find her password there

699
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,440
to to see that he actually has it plain

700
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,039
text somewhere

701
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,120
and i kept hitting this really big file

702
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
i think it was

703
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,880
i can't remember it's been a while but

704
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,559
maybe one and a half gigabytes or

705
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,000
something like that

706
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,320
it was in an unknown format but it had

707
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,679
clear text strings

708
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,559
all around it and i realized it's a key

709
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,919
logger log file

710
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,480
in a proprietary format so i i checked

711
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
the computer

712
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,279
more carefully and i found that he had

713
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,559
installed

714
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,440
a software called the best keylogger i

715
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
would have found

716
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,840
an actual screenshot of it but then

717
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
again hey go to google and try to find

718
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
the software called the best keylogger

719
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
it's not possible so i just took best

720
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,799
free keylogger this is not the actual

721
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,000
software

722
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,440
but it's close enough so i had installed

723
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,559
this keylogger

724
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,400
on the computer a few minutes before

725
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,000
retrieving it and got

726
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,080
all the credentials and started a really

727
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,000
aggressive several month campaign of

728
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,880
harassing his

729
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,200
ex-girlfriend and this was sort of

730
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,960
apparent on in this this whole thing

731
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,000
because

732
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,480
i forgot to turn off the keylogger so

733
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,640
so what he did he installed the

734
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,520
keylogger

735
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,279
and then he left the computer there for

736
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,840
a couple of months then he took it home

737
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,279
and started cyberstalking this girl

738
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,000
for several months keylogging all his

739
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,320
crimes with the same keylogger that he

740
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,760
used to steal the passwords

741
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
i spelled it out there for the benefit

742
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
of everybody so if you key log your own

743
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,200
crimes

744
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
and leave a log on the computer that

745
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,120
then ends up in the hands of the police

746
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,480
that's not good for you so please do

747
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,960
that

748
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,360
because i don't want criminals to have

749
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,000
good times

750
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but well this person sure didn't

751
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,520
but it's just it's just a good example

752
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,159
that

753
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,000
all it takes is one mistake just forget

754
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,240
to remove remove the software

755
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
and then things happen and other things

756
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,320
happen and some something takes a u-turn

757
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,039
and

758
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,080
by happenstance the investigator took

759
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,360
seriously

760
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,159
the claim that this guy had hacked the

761
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,679
facebook account

762
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,840
so i went and had a look and we found it

763
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,679
i think i filed

764
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,760
five or six different criminal reports

765
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
based on the key logging data alone

766
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,399
plus corroborating factors of course the

767
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,360
key log

768
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,919
wasn't the only thing we had we had

769
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,399
other things too because it just gave us

770
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,279
a very good time stamp and a timeline of

771
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:19,919
events

772
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,360
and then we could investigate

773
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,360
up to fail number three so ddos

774
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,880
we had a couple of youngsters who were

775
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,039
messing around they were ddosing a bunch

776
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,480
of websites and

777
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
and the way they were doing it is that

778
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,240
they were

779
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,360
they were not opening connections or

780
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,760
or directing too much traffic there or

781
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,640
anything like that

782
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
they realize that there are in such a

783
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,399
way configured

784
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,600
websites that if you search for star

785
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
it will actually retrieve everything and

786
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,799
show it to you

787
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,640
and this takes a long time and takes a

788
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
lot of resources

789
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
so that's what they did so they searched

790
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,679
for these services

791
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,720
that that would accept star as a search

792
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,919
criteria

793
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,880
and then they did that from several ip

794
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,760
addresses

795
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,000
and then i guess they felt really good

796
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,640
about themselves when the website

797
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
died i've never really understood the

798
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,120
power trip of

799
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,640
watching a browser trying to load a

800
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
website

801
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,559
and it won't load it doesn't just feel

802
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,320
it really doesn't have that oomph in my

803
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,760
opinion but

804
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,880
i guess that's somebody's thing so

805
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,399
that's that's what they did and they

806
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,120
were causing

807
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,000
actually a lot of problems for a lot of

808
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,919
companies and organizations and this

809
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:40,799
this was being

810
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,399
investigated quite thoroughly and

811
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,799
and this then i think there was some

812
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,240
twitter

813
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
twitter [ __ ] involved also but

814
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,440
but one thing and they they tested this

815
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,080
very carefully manually first just

816
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
finding those websites that would be

817
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
vulnerable for this kind of

818
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,480
resource exhaustion attacks and they

819
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,240
always use the vpn

820
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,399
except once and well

821
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,120
that's enough because when you have a

822
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,000
log

823
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,279
an access log and the access log shows

824
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,840
the search query as a get parameter and

825
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,399
you know

826
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,039
what kind of search query as a get

827
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,840
parameter causes resource exhaustion

828
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,240
and then you see that you have 10

829
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
million queries there

830
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,880
all coming from a vpn and exit node and

831
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,640
just a couple of them before

832
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,760
coming from an elisa adsl

833
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,480
as an example then you know well maybe

834
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,399
this is the ib address of the person

835
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,000
who's doing it

836
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,880
turns out it was and there was a lot of

837
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,520
other

838
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
proof also found later on but

839
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,520
yeah what's the fail here well first of

840
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,559
all

841
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,480
if you're going to do some serious crime

842
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,960
maybe get out of your mom's basement

843
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
and go to a library or something and

844
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
just

845
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,919
because vpn the thing is you really have

846
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,440
to trust that software

847
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
they see that it actually works and test

848
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,840
it all the time and when it once just

849
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
fails it says that it's on and it's not

850
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,760
on and then you do some crime

851
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,960
you connect the ib address right back at

852
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,600
you

853
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
because it's not a secret that the

854
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,679
police have

855
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,559
access to isps that we can find out a

856
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,799
finnish ip addresses

857
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,519
subscriber of course we can and uh of

858
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,000
course

859
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
it's essential to find out

860
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,279
who owns an ip address where where crime

861
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,000
are coming from

862
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,480
this one i actually didn't investigate

863
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,799
personally or or it wasn't investigated

864
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,000
by anybody i know

865
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,200
but this is a pretty good example

866
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,840
of how even the most serious

867
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
criminals running huge criminal

868
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,200
enterprises

869
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,480
silk road in this example make

870
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,919
really common mistakes at the beginning

871
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,840
of their career

872
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
uh ross albrecht i'm not sure how they

873
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,320
pronounce it so i'll just say uh

874
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,440
so he was great pirate roberts who was

875
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,120
running silk road

876
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,360
and silk road was this uh one of the

877
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,440
first dark net markets that you could

878
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,760
buy

879
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
anything off of guns drugs

880
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,840
basically anything it was his it was

881
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,760
based on his libertarian

882
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,080
utopian ideal that the government

883
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,600
shouldn't have

884
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,880
any control over a free free enterprise

885
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,600
so he based these ideas on on this

886
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
austrian economic economist called

887
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,000
ludwig

888
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,120
von mises and he quoted him at length

889
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,159
and he was he was certainly a man who

890
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
was possessed by an idea

891
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,000
and his idea was his brand of

892
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,840
libertarianism and he had thought that

893
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,919
technology uh would provide a perfect

894
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,279
solution for him

895
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,320
to start this libertarian marketplace so

896
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,360
that's what he did

897
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,679
and he started silk road and in the

898
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,360
beginning

899
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,640
well it was a startup company basically

900
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,440
and he was coding it himself and he had

901
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,760
some

902
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,679
issues and he didn't really know how

903
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,960
everything works

904
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,679
so he went where everybody goes when you

905
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,960
have an issue

906
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,600
with coding he went to stack exchange

907
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,559
eight years ago

908
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
actually eight years and two months ago

909
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,159
to be exact because i took this

910
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,240
screenshot a couple of days ago

911
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
and he was asking how can i connect to a

912
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,080
tor hidden service using

913
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,600
curl in php the issue was that he was

914
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,080
actually

915
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,200
using an account called rost ulbricht

916
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
and when he realized that i am asking

917
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,880
how

918
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,840
how to develop this criminal enterprise

919
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,519
under my own name he just went and

920
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,720
quickly changed the name to frosty

921
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,519
well his name was picked up and and it

922
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,799
was noted into a

923
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,600
small black notebook somewhere that law

924
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,760
enforcement officials keep

925
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,720
then he started mentioning silk road on

926
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,559
the forums

927
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,359
different kinds of forums and he was

928
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,280
well the first mention of silk road was

929
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,839
on this forum called shroomery.org

930
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,800
which is for users of magic mushrooms

931
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,520
who

932
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,599
incidentally were one of his biggest

933
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,359
customers so he sold

934
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,719
a lot of mushrooms to them the

935
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,639
facilitated sales of mushrooms to be

936
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,520
exact

937
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,719
and he used the name altoid which

938
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,960
some of you might know it's a it's a

939
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,839
brand of breath mints that comes in a

940
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,000
small

941
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,239
small tin and it's a hacker favorite

942
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
tinker toy to create something that fits

943
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,918
in an altoid box so i think that's where

944
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,280
it comes from

945
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,679
but then he was looking for somebody to

946
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,199
help him

947
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,119
uh with the bitcoin end of things

948
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,879
because this being a

949
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,199
cyber crime on tour so of course bitcoin

950
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,159
is involved

951
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,879
and he was looking for a bitcoin pro to

952
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,639
join his startup company

953
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,720
and of course the address that he listed

954
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,839
was rossualbricht

955
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,040
gmail.com using the name

956
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,240
altoid also using the same name

957
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,160
for the first public mention of silk

958
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,280
road so

959
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,000
small things but when when you're

960
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960
actually running

961
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,320
this size of an empire and

962
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
making millions and millions in illicit

963
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,920
drug money

964
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,280
and other services well people will pick

965
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,240
up on those small things

966
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,560
that message is still online and the

967
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,000
thing is that whatever you put on

968
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,760
internet is is

969
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,960
probably permanently on the internet

970
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,200
and two independent investigations

971
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,280
actually uncovered his identity as dread

972
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,640
pirate roberts

973
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,440
uh the first was an irs agent whose name

974
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,520
i have sadly forgotten

975
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,200
but it didn't really go anywhere he just

976
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,480
he was looking looking at this the money

977
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,079
laundering aspect of it

978
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,920
because of course they're the tax people

979
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,160
so they're interested in that

980
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,160
and the fbi was also very interested

981
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,880
but the problem with ross was that he

982
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
was

983
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,160
basically just unable to predict the

984
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,280
future

985
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,839
he didn't know what size his criminal

986
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,560
empire

987
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,200
will grow to be when he posted that one

988
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,960
message eight years ago

989
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,520
he didn't really well he didn't have the

990
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,920
gravity of the situation in mind when he

991
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,040
started

992
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
his illicit enterprise which meant that

993
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,000
he did not have

994
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,960
the necessarily careful mindset that it

995
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,839
takes

996
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,839
to run something like silk road and not

997
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,119
get caught

998
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,839
so he got caught and i think this is

999
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,320
probably true for uh for a lot of

1000
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,520
hackers especially

1001
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,000
hackers i'm saying hackers here because

1002
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
hackers

1003
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,320
are working in this environment

1004
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,280
where one big currency that they have is

1005
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,480
their fame

1006
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
and the thing about fame is that you

1007
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
can't sell fame and you can't transfer

1008
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,040
fame

1009
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,960
one wallet to another you have to attach

1010
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,200
fame to something that's recognized

1011
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
and when you don't want to bring

1012
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,720
anything about yourself to the public

1013
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,200
eye

1014
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,680
you only have your nickname that has

1015
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
that fame recognition so that that is

1016
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,800
your brand

1017
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,480
and that is basically the promise

1018
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,520
as in finnish they saying

1019
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,520
the name guarantees the quality so

1020
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,160
that they have a this attachment to that

1021
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,920
name which means that when they start

1022
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
and when they start young and when they

1023
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,560
start small

1024
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
they might be quite open about that name

1025
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
and they might even

1026
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,560
uh another real life example create web

1027
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,760
pages

1028
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,800
that are legitimate web pages with a

1029
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,640
copyright with their real name

1030
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,720
and their hacker email address

1031
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,040
underneath it because that wasn't

1032
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
they weren't hacking then but they

1033
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
started hacking six months later

1034
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,920
and then they had that name and they

1035
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,599
wanted to hang on to that name but they

1036
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,200
forgot that one breadcrumb on the

1037
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
internet

1038
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,480
and that one breadcrumb which connects

1039
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,599
their real name

1040
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,079
with their hacker alias and that's

1041
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,520
enough because when you have

1042
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,359
that little bit of string that you can

1043
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,720
start pulling on

1044
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,440
then the whole sweater will unravel so

1045
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
to speak

1046
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
so ross's problem was that ross wasn't

1047
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,000
able to predict the future

1048
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
so get that under control if you want to

1049
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,560
do crime

1050
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,720
i just chose something very well

1051
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,960
contemporary for the

1052
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,000
last fail because we all watched

1053
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,280
ransom main ransom man first try to

1054
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,960
extort wastamo

1055
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,400
for 450 000 or what was it and after

1056
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,839
failing that trying to extort

1057
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,839
the poor patients who lost their

1058
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,480
psychological

1059
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,640
the patient records to criminals and

1060
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,599
then he started

1061
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,480
trying to extort that those and that

1062
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,839
also failed

1063
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,960
i think he got a few payments out of it

1064
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,640
based on some bitcoin uh

1065
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,440
forensics but not much not much when you

1066
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,200
compare what kind of a risk he's taking

1067
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
and what kind of a

1068
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,040
damage it's causing but i think the

1069
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,880
biggest fail here

1070
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,240
was when he actually zipped

1071
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,960
up his own home folder on the hacking

1072
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,280
box that he was using and put it

1073
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,240
on the tor server that he was using to

1074
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,040
share

1075
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,119
the customer details or the customer

1076
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,400
information

1077
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,079
and stuck it there i'm not i have no

1078
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,680
idea how this happened

1079
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,040
why it happened but i have a theory

1080
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,960
and and i'll tell you that theory at the

1081
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,800
end of this presentation but

1082
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,839
but that's what he did

1083
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,680
so i didn't even point out the fail here

1084
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,480
it's all quite quite clear here and easy

1085
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,599
to see

1086
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,760
but just putting your whole hacking box

1087
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
home folder

1088
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,160
to the tour side for several hours is

1089
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,000
not a good idea if you don't want to get

1090
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,839
caught and when you have committed one

1091
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,000
of the worst cyber crimes in finnish

1092
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,640
history

1093
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,920
possibly european history so

1094
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,720
don't do that and if you see the time

1095
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
stamp there it's it's one minute passed

1096
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,160
and we of course had an

1097
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,560
automatic scraper technique so running

1098
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,839
against that and

1099
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,359
our scraper triggered that too fast so

1100
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,040
we locked out there it had triggered

1101
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,760
at zero zero well we would have gotten a

1102
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,720
little less of the package that we got

1103
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,870
but good job clown

1104
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,940
[Music]

1105
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,319
i often run into

1106
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,839
the idea that that people say that i

1107
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:40,400
don't think

1108
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,839
i don't think that's what they did that

1109
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,440
wouldn't make any sense

1110
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,200
and then after 10 years in cyber

1111
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,359
security and almost 20 years in security

1112
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,119
in general i've felt that that

1113
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,440
people often do a lot of stuff that

1114
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,359
doesn't make any sense

1115
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,760
and they do things that make sense at

1116
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,520
the time but then they realize the

1117
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,119
effects of what they've done

1118
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,119
and they start making less sense and

1119
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,960
then they hope they have a time machine

1120
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,240
so that they can go back to

1121
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,680
1984 and undo all the mistakes in their

1122
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,240
life

1123
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,319
so never base your theory on the

1124
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
assumption that the suspect will act in

1125
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,000
an intelligent and rational way

1126
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,040
because people are not rational and very

1127
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
few of us are intelligent

1128
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,680
actually this might be offensive but

1129
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,359
half of the population is less

1130
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,200
intelligent than average

1131
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,880
but that's not offensive because that's

1132
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,560
how averages work

1133
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,800
so that's good to keep in mind not all

1134
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,000
cyber criminals are

1135
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,400
geniuses some of them are not all of

1136
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,359
them not even most

1137
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,480
so this is a good example um well it's

1138
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,079
it's this time of year so

1139
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,240
we all have the same examples benjamin

1140
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,000
also spoke about colonial pipeline

1141
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,640
but i i want to draw a mental image of

1142
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,760
these guys that they

1143
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,599
they stopped the colonial pipeline and

1144
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,640
caused a huge gas crisis in the u.s

1145
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,599
and benjamin was focusing more on why

1146
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,520
they stopped the service i don't know

1147
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,319
i don't know what the point was those

1148
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,319
papers aren't out yet so there might be

1149
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,079
other reasons also

1150
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,119
then just not being able to bill people

1151
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,520
might be that they had reason to believe

1152
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,359
that there's somebody in the ot network

1153
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,560
or whatever

1154
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,280
i wasn't doing the dfir so i i won't

1155
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,400
speculate

1156
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,400
there are several options available but

1157
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
what happened well they got paid the

1158
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,319
dark side ransomware got paid and

1159
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,400
they're restarting but the gas crisis is

1160
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,680
still ongoing

1161
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,359
and when you look at this picture you

1162
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,200
start to get this

1163
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
place yourself in the shoes of the dark

1164
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,359
side gang and if you don't get

1165
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,319
the sense of impending doom when looking

1166
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,720
at this and this oh [ __ ] feeling

1167
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
that we probably did something worse

1168
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,400
that we were

1169
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,040
prepared for well then then you're not

1170
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,160
role playing this role very well

1171
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
well first they put out a press

1172
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,240
statement that we didn't mean to

1173
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,319
create problems we just stopped this

1174
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,400
well like well well we've heard this

1175
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,359
before

1176
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,800
like if you don't mean to create

1177
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,880
problems stop running ransomware you

1178
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,760
[ __ ]

1179
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,560
so that's that's not an excuse and this

1180
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,359
whole

1181
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,359
highbrow stuff about not hitting

1182
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,760
governments and not hitting healthcare

1183
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,839
everything's interconnected if you hit a

1184
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,680
pipeline that size you're going to hit a

1185
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,640
government

1186
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,240
and the problem with hitting governments

1187
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,880
is that some governments might hit back

1188
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,359
and i think they kind of realized this

1189
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,400
because

1190
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,800
the hacking forum xss bans all

1191
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,560
ransomware topics

1192
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,720
like straight out like we're done with

1193
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,920
this [ __ ]

1194
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,400
and they're also banned on exploit

1195
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,160
cybercrime forum and these are

1196
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,119
russian russian organized crime cyber

1197
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,359
crime forums these are not like

1198
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,319
4chan or uli lauda where moderation

1199
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,560
tries to keep the stuff a bit civil but

1200
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,720
allows for some craziness no these are

1201
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
criminal forums

1202
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,920
and they're even getting dropping it

1203
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,520
like a hot potato it's like

1204
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,880
[ __ ] we're not touching that anymore so

1205
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,160
it's gone and the dark side guys or

1206
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,200
girls also to the realistic conclusion

1207
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,040
that we should probably just

1208
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,000
burn everything we own and just move to

1209
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,920
kazakhstan with our 5 million

1210
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,880
or 45 or 500 million nobody knows how

1211
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,400
much money they have

1212
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,160
in bitcoin and try to start our lives

1213
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,359
again and maybe

1214
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,640
maybe not go near a computer for

1215
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,440
for a while because these kinds of

1216
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,240
attacks

1217
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,280
will will amp up interest

1218
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,760
in in a way that is not good for these

1219
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,240
criminals

1220
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,160
so the sum it up and just to

1221
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,319
try to learn a lists and lesson about

1222
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,480
all these five fails that i've spoken

1223
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,000
about these are trivial examples

1224
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,079
they suggest the day-to-day uh stuff of

1225
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,200
cyber crime investigations and

1226
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,520
i just thought they were good examples

1227
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,200
but cyber criminals are criminals

1228
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,880
criminals are people

1229
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,800
and if you know people you know people

1230
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,119
do dumb [ __ ] all the time

1231
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,000
and all you need is that one mistake

1232
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,440
just that one mistake

1233
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,280
and all the criminal has to do is to

1234
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,760
avoid doing that one mistake

1235
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,560
and it's really hard to find a criminal

1236
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,319
that doesn't make one mistake

1237
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,400
like seriously one well i think our job

1238
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,200
as the cyber crime investigators which

1239
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
we all are as we are cyber security pros

1240
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:29,839
we don't

1241
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,800
do criminal investigations as such but

1242
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,520
well

1243
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,960
all cyber security incidents they have

1244
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,119
a side of crime on them usually

1245
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,640
all we need to do is find that one

1246
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,950
mistake so

1247
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,119
[Music]

1248
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,240
go find that mistake

1249
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,280
that is my presentation and pep talk so

1250
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,280
thank you do you have any questions

1251
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,240
okay so i do have there there was a lot

1252
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,560
of

1253
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,079
questions thank you auntie for the talk

1254
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,119
and i got some of them here

1255
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,079
so let's get started how many really

1256
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,680
advanced criminals

1257
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,160
have you encountered advanced meaning

1258
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,359
it's really

1259
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,079
hard to find the evidence and notice the

1260
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:20,960
mistake or

1261
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,800
find information about them

1262
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,800
oh

1263
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,720
that's a really tough question i've i've

1264
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,079
met a couple of

1265
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,560
really advanced hackers like people who

1266
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,200
are very very good with computers

1267
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,599
but it was really easy to find evidence

1268
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,440
of their crimes so it's

1269
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,359
hard to say if this is this is what you

1270
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,119
mean because

1271
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,599
well in one example unencrypted hard

1272
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,440
drive chat logs of everything

1273
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,040
malware samples like the whole lot the

1274
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
problem was that there was so much proof

1275
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,000
that we had to

1276
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,480
figure out what to include and what to

1277
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,640
exclude and we had to exclude most of it

1278
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,319
because it was just a

1279
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,160
rabbit hole rabbit hole rabbit hole on

1280
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,160
that hard drive but it was very good

1281
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,480
technically very very good technically

1282
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,680
especially given his age so one example

1283
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,440
there

1284
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,200
of course we always run up to these

1285
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,760
situations where we have no idea who the

1286
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,040
attacker is

1287
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,599
and that could be just because they

1288
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,280
covered their tracks enough or that we

1289
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,119
don't have the resources to dig deep

1290
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,240
enough

1291
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,160
so hard to say it's like how many

1292
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,079
unicorns you haven't seen

1293
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,400
like well all of them none some

1294
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,520
but good question good question

1295
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,559
okay and then the next one uh what would

1296
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,200
you say

1297
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,000
to those who probably have already

1298
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,240
tasted the so-called dark side of

1299
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,720
cyber security young adults and

1300
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,520
pre-teens

1301
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,880
interested in all things cyber and do

1302
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,839
not know yet

1303
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,440
which side to choose

1304
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,119
i'll say that when you're young making a

1305
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,440
lot of money seems

1306
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,520
like that's the reason why people get

1307
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,440
good jobs and that's that's not

1308
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,680
actually not even remotely true it's

1309
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,440
true when you don't have money but when

1310
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,240
you have

1311
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,520
let's say 4 000 euros a month

1312
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,440
everything over that is just extra

1313
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,040
depending of course on your situation

1314
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,800
and your living expenses yada yada yada

1315
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,200
but

1316
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,119
after that it comes down to the purpose

1317
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,119
of your job and what you're doing

1318
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,640
and what it brings

1319
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,440
you and do you get to make a positive

1320
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,880
difference in the world

1321
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,880
or is what you're doing making a

1322
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,720
negative difference in the world

1323
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,040
so crime makes a negative difference in

1324
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,520
the world but it has a lot of money

1325
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,720
sure short term usually and if you get

1326
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,599
high enough

1327
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,680
but now it starts to be the situation

1328
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,599
that there's not even that much money

1329
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,839
makes negative difference in the world

1330
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,920
and there's no career path there and you

1331
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,839
can't even tell anybody really what

1332
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:00,800
you're doing so

1333
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,640
just just think really wisely if you're

1334
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,400
interested in this stuff there's enough

1335
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,000
work to do

1336
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,480
uh on the white hat side there's enough

1337
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,200
jobs

1338
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,640
but the thing is that you have to pay

1339
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
your dues you have to start low and then

1340
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,520
build up

1341
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,480
and if you're good start at a stock and

1342
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,200
just work

1343
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,559
and take every job you have seriously

1344
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,160
and try to be the best at it and

1345
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,839
life will reward you with better and

1346
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,520
more interesting jobs and just

1347
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,760
taking a shortcut by hacking companies

1348
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,520
and extorting people it might be

1349
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,000
interesting

1350
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,559
for a while but it's gonna end up badly

1351
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,920
and it's not a very good

1352
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,040
life choice okay

1353
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,440

1356
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,559
