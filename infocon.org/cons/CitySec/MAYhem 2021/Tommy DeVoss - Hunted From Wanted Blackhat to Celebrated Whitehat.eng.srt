and military and things like that

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,640
all right let's see um so the beginning

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,079
um i started getting on computers for

32
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,360
the first time when i was

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,159
probably around 10 years old or so uh

34
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,360
that's when

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,399
um the my stepfather at the time

36
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
he brought home the first computer i

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
don't remember what kind it was but it

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,680
was one where

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
all of the games and stuff we had to

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,640
play were on those big floppy disks and

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
there was no internet connections or

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
anything like that

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,119
um but as soon as i started playing on

44
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,038
the computer the first time i just

45
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,120
absolutely fell in love with everything

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,040
about it um

47
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,080
i played around on games like wheel of

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,920
fortune and some baseball games and

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
stuff like that

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
uh while i had that computer and

51
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
i was introduced to the internet a

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,720
couple of years later

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,080
my little cousin his dad brought home a

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,920
computer and one of my cousin's

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,879
other cousins uh was a game developer

56
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,519
and

57
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
he knew how to get things on the

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
internet and all of that stuff

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,239
so um once my

60
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
uncle told him that he had just bought a

61
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,760
new computer and stuff

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
he came over one weekend and showed them

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,599
how to

64
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,239
get a dial up our first dial up was with

65
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,480
uh minespring i believe it was which was

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,879
a

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,560
guy life isp here in the us

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,319
during the 90s and um back then when you

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,840
got dial-ups and stuff like that they

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
would send you a little floppy disk

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,440
to uh install things and the floppy

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,959
disks that came with it happened to have

73
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,080
a program called

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,200
mirc on it and at the time i had

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
absolutely no idea what it was

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
but uh the person helping us set up the

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,959
computer knew what it was because he had

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
spent some time on irc

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,879
so he helped us get everything set up

80
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,840
and um

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,040
i was introduced to the f-net network

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,080
um f-net is an irc network that is still

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,200
around today

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,680
um it's the first network that i ever

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
started hanging out on

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,720
and um that's where basically everything

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
started for me when it comes to

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,760
packing uh computers and in general

89
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
um i started out on f net just

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,280
like any other young teenage boy looking

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,159
to talk to

92
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,840
people and talk to females and stuff

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
like that i

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,959
ended up spending a good

95
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,720
year or so on irc um just exploring

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,959
learning the different chat rooms and

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,519
everything and um

98
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,839
i got introduced to something called an

99
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
xdcc

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,918
bot which was a bot that would run on an

101
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,199
irc server

102
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
and you could download files from it it

103
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,759
could host

104
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,880
anything from um software which we

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,479
called wares at the time because it

106
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,800
would most likely be cracked software

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
um you could download uh pictures

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,560
um songs um like waves in the wave

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,120
format

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,720
and everything um when i first

111
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
got introduced to the xdcc bots it was

112
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
uh

113
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
really intriguing to me i really like

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
the idea that

115
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,919
you had a piece of software running on

116
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,880
another computer

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,160
that um was able to

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
always stay online and interact with

119
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
other people and

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,240
things like that i downloaded my own

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,120
software to

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
try to run my own xdcc bot but because

123
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
of being on a dial up

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,479
whenever i would disconnect from the

125
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,800
internet it would disconnect as well

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
um i started questioning people in

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
the the main wares channels and stuff

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
like that trying to figure out

129
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
how they got their compute their bots to

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
stay online all the time

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,800
and that was the first time i was

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,120
introduced to the word shell

133
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
uh shell is was referring to

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,600
an account on a remote system like a

135
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
remote linux or unix system

136
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,800
that you could use to run any type of

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
software that you wanted

138
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
a lot of the companies that offered you

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,479
shell accounts on their systems

140
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,440
would place limitations and stuff on

141
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
what you are allowed to use

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080
their cisco score naturally um there

143
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
were others there were some

144
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
of course that they didn't care what you

145
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
ran on it as long as you paid

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
the appropriate monthly amount for

147
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
whatever the show

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,039
was back then they would charge you

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,479
based on

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
the number of background processes that

151
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,160
you would be running from within your

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,880
account

153
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,000
and your disk space so for like five

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
megabits

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,319
of disk space and um one or two

156
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,919
background processes that you were

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,800
allowed to run

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
you would look at maybe spending five to

159
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,080
ten dollars a month

160
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
um when i first started it ended up

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
getting a lot cheaper

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,720
later on because there were a lot more

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
companies

164
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
that were being set up to provide

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
services like this

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,160
um i didn't have i was too young to

167
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
really have money or have the ability to

168
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
pay people online to be able to buy

169
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,680
these shell accounts because i didn't

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
have a credit card

171
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
so i started um

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,639
trying to figure out ways to get my own

173
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,840
shell accounts

174
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
um while trying to do this i would join

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,639
various channels on f

176
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
net pound shell pound shells

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280
shelves with a z and um just any other

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
kind of chat room where i thought there

179
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
would be

180
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
uh hackers and stuff like that to be

181
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
able to

182
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,560
get information about these shows um i

183
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
ended up joining the wrong chat room i

184
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
guess you could call it uh one day by

185
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
mistake

186
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
and it was a chat room that was run by a

187
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,319
gay guy

188
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,520
named uh lewis and he was a hacker from

189
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
san jose california um as soon as i went

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
into the

191
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
um chat room the first thing i noticed

192
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,440
was

193
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
he had hundreds of bots in the channel

194
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
that were all running on college uh

195
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
college servers and knowing that there

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,840
was no way that he went to all those

197
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,560
colleges

198
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,199
or had legitimate access to those they

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
knew right away that he

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,759
he was probably a hacker back then

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,400
everybody wanted uh shells on college

202
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
computers because they had

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,319
the absolute fastest internet and their

204
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,280
speeds were just

205
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,120
insane and any student that went to the

206
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
colleges

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
could plug in their own computers into

208
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,080
like the wall in their dorm room

209
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,800
and be on the college network and it

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
wasn't an always-on connection

211
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,680
and that opened the door to

212
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
tons of computers that were able to be

213
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
hacked because they were always online

214
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
and most of them were being run by

215
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
students that may not know

216
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
the uh ins and outs of the operating

217
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,879
system that they were running and know

218
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,400
how to properly secure it

219
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,000
and things so as soon as i saw that i

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,640
was just

221
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
basically obsessed with this guy in his

222
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
chatroom

223
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,719
i hung out in there for a little while

224
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,760
and

225
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
would be talking trying to get somebody

226
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
to respond back but at first

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
nobody ever responded because it was

228
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,120
just um

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
this guy's private room that was just

230
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
him a bunch of his bots

231
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
and occasionally he would have other

232
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,560
friends that would come in and out of

233
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,600
the chat room

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,120
like when he was online so um i

235
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
basically would join the chat room every

236
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,959
time that i ever got a line

237
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
after that point waiting and looking for

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
somebody to talk to because i wanted to

239
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,839
know

240
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
how lewis got all of those shells to be

241
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,720
running all of those bots

242
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
and um eventually after

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
i don't remember if it was a couple of

244
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
days or maybe a week or two of

245
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,880
constantly joining the chat room every

246
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
day after school

247
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
um i joined it and i actually saw people

248
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
talking for the first time

249
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,680
and i they got me really super excited

250
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,279
so i started basically butting into

251
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,160
their conversation

252
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,480
i was a kid at the time and i didn't

253
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
really have the concept of

254
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
or understand the concept of being

255
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
polite and didn't understand

256
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
anything about hackers where they were

257
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
distrustful of other people or anything

258
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
like that so

259
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
i was just some random kid in this guy's

260
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,279
chat room and

261
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,360
at first he banned me from the chatroom

262
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,800
and um

263
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
i admittedly was a little bit upset

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,959
about that

265
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,880
but thanks to the fact that i was on a

266
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,560
dial up internet connection

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
i just disconnected my internet

268
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
connection reconnected

269
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
and was able to join right back into it

270
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
um

271
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
i did this over the course of several

272
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,399
months

273
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
he would uh ban me

274
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,519
i would go back into the channel he

275
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
would ban me again and then

276
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
i would just keep on doing that and then

277
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
it would get to the point where

278
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,760
i would be back in the chat room and the

279
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
only time it wasn't banned when nobody

280
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
was online to ban me

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
so um after several months of basically

282
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
really annoying this guy that uh

283
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
was going in there um i don't know why

284
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,959
but he

285
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,600
finally decided one day that he was

286
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,560
gonna be nice to me

287
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
um i don't know if maybe he had a good

288
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,920
day that day or what but

289
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
instead of banning me he actually

290
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
started talking to me

291
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
um maybe he was just bored that day

292
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,480
because nobody else was online or

293
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,519
something but uh

294
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,360
he started talking to me and i

295
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
just started asking him everything that

296
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
i possibly could on

297
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,440
how he got the shelves how he was

298
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
running all those spots and everything

299
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,680
like that

300
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,079
and at first he was extremely skeptical

301
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,720
of me

302
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
because well here's this person he

303
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
didn't know that i was just a kid

304
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
he didn't know anything about me

305
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
whatsoever and for all he knew

306
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
i could have been an fbi agent or a

307
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,720
government agent period that was in

308
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,360
there

309
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,079
questioning him because of his hacking

310
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:28,880
activities and

311
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,399
everything uh so um

312
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,320
at first he didn't want to teach me

313
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
anything he didn't want to

314
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
like he would answer a couple of

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,600
questions but that was about it he

316
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,480
didn't want to actually

317
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,440
show me how to do it do anything but i

318
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
didn't give up and i just

319
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
kept on bugging him and it got to the

320
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,079
point where he started

321
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
opening up to me a little bit more and

322
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,360
started like uh

323
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
telling me okay i'll teach you some

324
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,800
stuff but you have to do

325
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
this this and this first and one of the

326
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,639
first things that he told me

327
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,519
was that he wanted me to go and find

328
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,279
everything on the internet

329
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,560
that i could and read it all and when i

330
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,519
was done

331
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
about hacking and when i was done that

332
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
he said that he would then teach me how

333
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,959
to be a hacker

334
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
so i was like okay great so that's what

335
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,880
i set out to do

336
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,040
i started using the search engines at

337
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
the time

338
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
which um i don't remember what they are

339
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,240
right now um i want to say somewhere on

340
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,639
like

341
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,920

342
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,800
this was before google event existed and

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
um

344
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
um i just read as much stuff as i can

345
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,320
and instead of just uh

346
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
going and skimming through it i would

347
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
try to

348
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
actually understand it and when i was

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,639
reading something that i didn't

350
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,440
understand

351
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,240
i would go to him and show him what i

352
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,279
was reading

353
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,839
and asked him if he could like help

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
explain it a little bit better or

355
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,720
um something along those lines just to

356
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,680
give me a little bit

357
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
more information i found out later on um

358
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,079
after me and him became

359
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,800
really good friends that this was a

360
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
method that he used

361
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,600
to kind of vet people that

362
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
wanted that would come in and start

363
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
talking to him about hacking

364
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,600
he said that most people that he ended

365
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,639
up telling okay

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,320
go to the internet and read everything

367
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
you can about hacking when you're done

368
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,600
come back to me and i'll

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,279
start teaching you how to hack he said

370
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,440
that most people especially young kids

371
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,639
like my age

372
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
would go and come back a couple of hours

373
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,880
later or the next day

374
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
and claim okay i read everything there

375
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
is on the internet so

376
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,880
now you can start teaching me and people

377
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
that would do that

378
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
you would never help them you would

379
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
continue to ban them and just basically

380
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,959
ignore them

381
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
um he ended up telling me that because

382
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
i actually showed the initiative and

383
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,399
spent the time going out and

384
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
trying to read anything that i could

385
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
find i came back to him with

386
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
um questions and showed him that i was

387
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,880
trying to put in the effort and

388
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,079
everything like that that

389
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,839
that's what ended up making him change

390
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,120
his mind to where

391
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,800
he agreed to want to start helping me

392
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,240
um it ended up getting to the point

393
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,720
where

394
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,839
he gave me my first shell account on

395
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,240
some

396
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
computer that was like uh from another

397
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
country

398
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,560
and um the reason he gave it to me i

399
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
didn't know at the time

400
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,040
was because it was a pretty much a

401
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,519
worthless shell it wasn't a root account

402
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,959
or anything like that it was very

403
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,160
limited privileges and it was missing

404
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
a lot of the different files that you

405
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
needed back then in order to

406
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,839
run the egg drop bots and stuff for the

407
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,839
um irc bots and everything like it was

408
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,680
missing compilers and all of that stuff

409
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,079
so

410
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,800
it was pretty much a useless show but it

411
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
was my first show i didn't realize it

412
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,600
was useless

413
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
and i set out trying to figure out how

414
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
to start using it

415
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,639
um i took that shell access

416
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
and i went back to the shells channels

417
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,120
where it was people that

418
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
were engaged in the trading of back and

419
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,199
forth of

420
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,279
shell accounts and um

421
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,519
um they they would trade shell accounts

422
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,199
people would hack into

423
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,680
servers get root on the servers and they

424
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,199
would go into the shell room

425
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,160
shelves rooms and they would advertise

426
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,480
like

427
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,920
willing to trade um shell accounts on

428
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,120
this server for

429
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
shell accounts on this type of server

430
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
whether it be a specific operating

431
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,240
system

432
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,839
or specific geographical location or

433
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,839
something somewhere along those lines a

434
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
lot of the people because they had

435
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,320
hacked

436
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,399
the servers and gotten root they were

437
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
able to create the accounts

438
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
that they were trading out so they

439
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,720
weren't really losing anything

440
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
um i had my one shell account

441
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,399
and i didn't really know how to use it

442
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,279
so i started

443
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,360
asking the active people in there like

444
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
hey can you

445
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,440
help me figure out why such and such

446
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
isn't working on my show and everything

447
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
like that

448
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,800
and um the very first person that i

449
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,680
trusted

450
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,120
and um gave them the login information

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,160
for my show

452
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,079
he stole my show from me and um i

453
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
i didn't really understand it

454
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,639
at first and then i realized after the

455
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,320
fact that he had gone into the account

456
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
um the shell account

457
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
changed the password on it and then he

458
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,880
just like

459
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
blocked me so that i couldn't even talk

460
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
to him anymore

461
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,120
um i went back to louis and told him i

462
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,000
was like hey

463
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
my shell account's not working anymore i

464
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,120
don't know what happened

465
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
because i didn't want to tell him that i

466
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,880
had given access to somebody else

467
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,240
because i thought he was going to be mad

468
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,639
at me

469
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,240
because he had given me this show you

470
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
know and um

471
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,600
he sat there and luckily uh

472
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,079
he he basically didn't get mad at me he

473
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,000
kind of explained he was like did you

474
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
give anybody access to it

475
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
and i was like well no i didn't um i was

476
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
trying to get somebody to help me but

477
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
i didn't tell them the passwords and

478
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,599
things like that

479
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,079
he had another account on the same box

480
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,319
so he was able to log into his account

481
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
and while it wasn't a root account he

482
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
was able to run like the w command and

483
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,919
see who was connected to it

484
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,520
and he saw that the account that he had

485
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,319
given me was logged into the system at

486
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,199
that time

487
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,919
and it showed the ip address of the

488
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
person that was connected to the account

489
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
and he knew right off that it wasn't my

490
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,200
wasn't my ip address

491
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
so then he came back to me and he was

492
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
like well

493
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
your your shell got ripped and i didn't

494
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,520
understand what he meant like i

495
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
thought that i had like physically

496
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
broken the shell or something and i was

497
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
like maybe i was wrong maybe the person

498
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
didn't steal it from me and maybe i just

499
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,720
broke it somehow and then he ended up

500
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,520
um explaining to me that a ripped shell

501
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,919
meant

502
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,600
that somebody ripped me off they had

503
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,039
stolen my shell

504
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,520
and um from that point on he pretty much

505
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
told me that i wasn't allowed to go

506
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,720
into the shells channels and

507
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,240
trade or anything with any shell access

508
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
that he had given me

509
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,679
and i i felt like that was a pretty

510
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,440
pretty reasonable request a

511
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,080
request from him and um he ended up

512
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
giving me another show

513
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
this time it was actually on what we

514
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,720
called an edu

515
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
it was a server that was being run at a

516
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,240
university so the host name of it

517
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,280
ended in dot edu and um this was a

518
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
server that he actually had root on so

519
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,480
he created me my own account and gave me

520
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
that one so that way

521
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,320
if i guess i was stupid enough to go and

522
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
get ripped again at least you would

523
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,679
be able to either take the account back

524
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,000
from me or from whoever ripped it or

525
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,679
just deleted so that way the person

526
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,720
wouldn't be able to

527
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
like try to steal access from him on

528
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,919
that server

529
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
because that was a big problem as well

530
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,360
you were worried about people

531
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
you creating an account on one of your

532
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,480
hacked boxes

533
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
for somebody and obviously if you were

534
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
able to hack it and get root then

535
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,039
somebody else could do the same thing so

536
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,160
he was worried about

537
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,360
that happening um he ended up

538
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
um helping me uh on this shell account

539
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,640
and showed me how to start downloading

540
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,760
exploits and various port scanners and

541
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,520
stuff like that so that way i could

542
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,039
start trying to make

543
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,320
um get my own shell accounts um because

544
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,640
he ran what was called an irc takeover

545
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,760
group and an irc takeover group was

546
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
basically just like it sounds on fnet in

547
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
the 90s

548
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,480
you were able to um dos

549
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,160
or ddos a any server that you wanted

550
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
that was connected to this network

551
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,880
and it would disconnect that server from

552
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,400
the rest of the network and this was

553
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
called a netsplit

554
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
and the purpose of a netsplit would be

555
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
you would find a server that none of the

556
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,120
operators

557
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
in a whatever room you are wanting to

558
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,640
take over you would find

559
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600
a server on that network that not a

560
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
single one of the operators

561
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,480
were on that specific server and you did

562
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,559
this because when you would

563
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,320
dos the server and disconnect it from

564
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
the network

565
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
um you would still be able to connect to

566
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
the net to that irc server

567
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,480
it just wouldn't be connected to

568
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,320
anything so it would only be

569
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
the people that were connected to that

570
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
server so we would disconnect a

571
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
server from the network and we would go

572
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
into it we would join the chat room that

573
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
we were trying to

574
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,320
take over and if nobody else was in that

575
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,039
chat room

576
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,120
the server would think that we just

577
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,080
created the server

578
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,240
i mean the chat room and it would give

579
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,360
us what's called

580
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,000
operator status within that chat room

581
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,559
and

582
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,919
when that happened we would then stop um

583
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,400
dosing it so that way it would end up

584
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,120
being able to reconnect to the network

585
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
and when it reconnects to the network we

586
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,240
call this

587
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,159
writing the split so when it would

588
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,280
reconnect

589
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,919
you would stay on that server and as it

590
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,200
connected you would see

591
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,760
all kinds of stuff in the chat room like

592
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
scrolling where

593
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
it shows all the servers reconnecting or

594
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
it reconnecting to all the servers

595
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
and all of a sudden everybody that was

596
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,799
in the chat room

597
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,880
on the servers that were still connected

598
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
would be shown as

599
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
joining even though they were already on

600
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,080
it it looked like they were all

601
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,559
just joining because of the servers

602
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,760
coming back in

603
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,159
and when you would ride the split in as

604
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,280
an operator

605
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,919
the trick was to try to do what we

606
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,480
called

607
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,760
a mass dia and that means

608
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,159
we would try to remove the operator

609
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:34,799
status

610
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,679
of every other operator in that room

611
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,520
within like a second or two

612
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,200
of the the net split finishing

613
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,360
and you would do that so that way you

614
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,799
would be the only person

615
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,280
that was left as the operator and then

616
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
you basically own that room

617
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,240
once you de-opt everybody you would then

618
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,159
invite your um your your botnet

619
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,480
um i forgot what it was called but you

620
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,520
would have the

621
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
botnets that there would be one main bot

622
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,039
that acted as like the uh

623
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,919
um in today's terminology it would kind

624
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,520
of be like the command and control

625
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,320
server

626
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
um but that's not exactly what it was it

627
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,799
was a bot that all of the other bots

628
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,440
connected to and could receive commands

629
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,880
from and stuff like that

630
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,679
so we would have the botnets join the

631
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,240
channel

632
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
and we would set them as the operators

633
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
and then

634
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,080
it was ours and for as long as we could

635
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,360
uh

636
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
we could maintain the operator status

637
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,360
within that server

638
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,240
or within that room and um there was a

639
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
trick to prevent this from happening

640
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
so that people couldn't take your

641
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,919
channels and that was to make sure that

642
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,960
you had at least

643
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
one bot that was that had the operator

644
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,120
status

645
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,480
on every single server on the network

646
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
and it sounds like that would be pretty

647
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,400
easy to do but back then

648
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
in the 90s um some of these networks

649
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,000
like

650
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,039
fnet um undernet downnet

651
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,520
chat net they had a lot of servers that

652
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,480
were connected to it so in order to have

653
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,760
one at least one or two bots you would

654
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,600
ideally you would want more than one

655
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080
because if you only had one bot

656
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,720
that was on a specific server while the

657
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
person that is trying to take your chat

658
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,520
room could

659
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,120
first dos or ddos that one bot

660
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
disconnect it and then do the net split

661
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,799
so that way it was

662
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,960
it wasn't protected on that server so um

663
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,400
i started i basically joined um lewis's

664
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,799
takeover crew we were called uh those

665
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,600
damn kids

666
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,039
tdk and um i

667
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,440
started helping them trying to um

668
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
basically expand our botnet

669
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,400
um i wasn't extremely good of course

670
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,159
because i was just starting so

671
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,240
i would always end up with uh really bad

672
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,799
bad shelves or bad servers like i would

673
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,679
find

674
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,960
shells that had really bad um connection

675
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,400
speeds or

676
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,679
shells that or servers that didn't have

677
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,880
all of the proper uh software that we

678
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,600
needed to

679
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,440
compile and run our bots and um

680
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,559
everything so we got to the point where

681
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,679
um he he's just started teaching me it

682
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,559
all basically

683
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,760
and once we had our actual

684
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,559
egg drop bots to the point where it was

685
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,400
a big enough net that we had

686
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
at least a couple of bots on every

687
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,400
single server that's when we started

688
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,159
transitioning to working on

689
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,760
our ddos net the first ddos software

690
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,200
that i ever used

691
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,720
um i think it was called trino

692
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,360
um trin00 and then there was another one

693
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,240
that was made by a german hacker i think

694
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,919
his name was mixer

695
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,360
and i don't know how to pronounce the

696
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,080
name of it but it translated from german

697
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
to english the translation was silent

698
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,279
night

699
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,880
and those were the two main

700
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
dos tools that we would use so i spent

701
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
all of my time after school uh just

702
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,000
helping expand our botnets and stuff

703
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,679
like that for all of these

704
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,760
i and i did this for a couple of years

705
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,039
um

706
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,159
i spent probably a good two or three

707
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,760
years just doing the

708
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,039
the irc war stuff and uh

709
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,880
it got to the point where my parents

710
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
were not my parents my mom and my

711
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,120
sisters

712
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
started to get online as well they had

713
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
gotten introduced to irc

714
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
and they were really enjoying talking uh

715
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
talking on irc and all of that stuff too

716
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,840
so

717
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,200
we uh we would hang out at times but

718
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
we kind of ran in completely different

719
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,240
circles but

720
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,200
um there was plenty of times where i

721
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
would be hanging out with my friends on

722
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,520
fnet

723
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,840
and my mom would be in a chat room on

724
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,559
ethnic called

725
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
cyber check and that was just like one

726
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,400
of the

727
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,200
main channels on this network so when

728
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,799
you connect to mrc

729
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
it pops up once you connect to the

730
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,120
server a little window would pop up

731
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
that would list all of the default

732
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,480
channels

733
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,600
that were available on that server and

734
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,440
cyber chat was one of them so

735
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
the channels that came up under the

736
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
default list are the ones that everybody

737
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,240
wanted to own

738
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,559
because those are the ones that got the

739
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,440
most users

740
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
the object was to own the rooms that had

741
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,120
the most users because

742
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,679
only gave you kind of like prestige and

743
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,799
stuff like that

744
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,039
well uh there were instances where

745
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,400
people would go into

746
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,159
cyber chat where my mom was and people

747
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,679
would just be disrespectful it would

748
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,440
probably be other kids that were about

749
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
my age and stuff

750
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,039
and um they would sit there and start

751
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,559
disrespecting my mom

752
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,799
like being rude to her cussing her out

753
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,600
and stuff

754
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,679
and she would always threaten him if you

755
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,880
don't leave me alone

756
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,039
i'm gonna tell my son and he's gonna

757
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,640
come and hack you and everything

758
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,360
and just like if anybody heard that from

759
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
anybody else

760
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,120
most people's reaction was basically

761
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
just to laugh at her and be like

762
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,440
whatever

763
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,279
i'm a hacker too i'm not scared of your

764
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,200
son blah blah blah

765
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,520
and um she would be like on the other

766
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,200
side of the house but she would yell

767
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,679
across the house like tommy i need you

768
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,720
to come into

769
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,559
the chat room we've got people that are

770
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,000
in here being mean or

771
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
whatever and uh me and louis and a

772
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,240
couple of other people would join the

773
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,960
chat room

774
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
and we would watch for a second we would

775
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,679
see the person being rude or

776
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,080
uh disrespectful and everything so we

777
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
would always be like all right well

778
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,279
you need to leave her alone that's my

779
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,159
mom and basically we gave him a shot we

780
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
told him if you leave her alone and just

781
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,399
leave

782
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,080
then that'll that'll be it you won't

783
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,520
hear from us again but if you don't

784
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,279
listen to us we would start threatening

785
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,080
i'm saying

786
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,720
we would hack his computer or we would

787
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,480
dawson or something like that

788
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,399
now back in the 90s there was a tool

789
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,679
that you could use

790
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,720
that was um called uh when nuke

791
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,399
any computer that was running like

792
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,880
windows 95 and windows 98

793
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,399
there was uh some little command

794
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,919
that you were able to send to their ip

795
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,640
address

796
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
that would instantly cause them to get a

797
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,080
blue screen of death

798
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,279
and on fnet they made no attempt to

799
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,159
hide the ip address of each individual

800
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:18,880
users

801
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
so all you had to do was type like slash

802
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,320
who is

803
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,159
the nickname and it would give you their

804
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,559
host name or their ip address and if it

805
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,399
gave you the host name you could just do

806
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,159
slash dns the host name and it would

807
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,520
give you the ip address

808
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,240
and we would at first we would nuke them

809
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,640
and

810
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,279
knock them offline and most of the time

811
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,799
they would come right back

812
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,480
and still talk crap and threaten us back

813
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,360
and stuff so

814
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
it got to the point where there were

815
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
some people that

816
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
were so disrespectful when we did this

817
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
that we instead of just nuking them

818
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
we would ddos their ip addresses and

819
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,760
there was a couple of times that

820
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,159
we we didn't really understand the power

821
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,760
of our botnets back then

822
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,240
so we didn't realize just how strong

823
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,880
they were

824
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,559
or it had become and we ddosed one

825
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,520
person

826
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
that was bothering my mom and we ended

827
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,279
up dropping

828
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,480
at the uh the isp that he was connected

829
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,120
to

830
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,000
every single person in his entire city

831
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,760
was knocked offline because we had

832
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,080
ddosed his ip address so hard

833
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,279
and the first time um i did that that

834
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,320
was kind of like

835
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,919
uh uh oh crap like i have this much

836
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,039
power online

837
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,480
and being 13 14 15 year old kid

838
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,880
having the power to take an entire city

839
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
off the internet

840
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,200
just kind of made my head blow up like

841
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,919
like crazy it made me think i was some

842
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,279
hot [ __ ] hacker that uh was much better

843
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:47,679
than

844
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,880
i actually was and um

845
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,600
yeah so we just we would go about doing

846
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,559
things like that

847
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,760
and um it got to be about

848
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,799
97 maybe 98 and i

849
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,399
was starting to get bored doing these

850
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,399
irc takeovers and stuff like that

851
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,640
i still did them but i was starting to

852
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
look for things that

853
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,279
would be more fun you know and um that's

854
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,080
when i got

855
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,799
introduced to the concept of defacing

856
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,679
websites

857
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,440
there was a website at the time and it's

858
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,960
still around now called

859
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,159
attrition.org and

860
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,000
they would mirror websites that um

861
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,960
had been hacked so if a website got

862
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,600
hacked

863
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,120
either the person that hacked it um or

864
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
somebody else could go to attrition

865
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,320
and submit the website and say okay this

866
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,240
website was defaced and this is the

867
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,360
person that did it

868
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
and then the people that ran attrition

869
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,480
would then go

870
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
verify that it was hacked and then they

871
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,159
would mirror the website to kind of keep

872
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:48,880
a log

873
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,360
or a record showing that it was hacked

874
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,559
and who did it

875
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,159
and um i got my first couple of sites

876
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,440
mirrored on attrition and like i said 97

877
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,399
or 98

878
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,799
and once i did that it kind of it got my

879
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,320
interest a whole lot more because

880
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,559
now i was able uh to deface websites and

881
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,519
it would be able to report it on here so

882
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,799
then it would kind of help me

883
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,080
like build up my uh credibility

884
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,880
or um something along those lines just

885
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,440
uh

886
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,760
like my elite skills or whatever because

887
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,279
i was able to have

888
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,679
proof that i was able to hack websites

889
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,720
instead of just

890
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,240
telling people that i was going to hack

891
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,559
them and stuff like that

892
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,559
um so i spent about uh

893
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,159
a year or so doing this by myself

894
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,600
um because uh lewis he didn't like

895
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,080
defacing websites he just wanted to do

896
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,799
the irc

897
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,480
wars and everything because he felt that

898
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,840
uh defacing the websites would

899
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
bring too much heat on him and when you

900
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
deface the website they know you're on

901
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,559
the system

902
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,600
so you have a much higher likelihood of

903
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,519
losing access to the server and he

904
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,880
didn't want to lose access to the

905
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,080
servers that he act

906
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,640
he act into so while i still was doing

907
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
the irc wars with them

908
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,559
here and there i started transitioning

909
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,679
to doing the website defacement thing

910
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,279
it got to be about 1999 and i joined

911
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,480
my first um defacement what we called a

912
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,399
defacement group

913
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,600
the name of this crew was the fear ph

914
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,880
33r hacksaw h4x0r

915
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,320
crew cr uh 3w stupid

916
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
stupid name of course but we were all a

917
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,600
bunch of kids

918
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,480
um i joined them and started defacing

919
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,840
websites with them

920
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,799
um most of the websites that we defaced

921
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,760
as part of this

922
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,039
uh this group were like

923
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,279
nothing websites they were random

924
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,240
peoples

925
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,360
like personal websites or like

926
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,640
uh a hardware store in indiana and stuff

927
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,200
like that

928
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,240
no meaningful website and people kind of

929
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,519
made fun of us

930
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,279
uh because of it because they were like

931
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,120
you're you're hacking into things that

932
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,760
like

933
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,399
my anybody could hack into so you're not

934
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,159
really showing that you have

935
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,080
good skills or anything like that um

936
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,720
once i got had gotten into that i

937
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,039
started every single day i would

938
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,279
go to attrition.org and i would look at

939
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,200
the mirror for every other website that

940
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,000
was hacked

941
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,559
and a lot of us that was were defacing

942
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,440
websites

943
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,760
we would put on there we would put our

944
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,000
message and then we would give our shout

945
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,880
outs to

946
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,960
other hacking groups or other people

947
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,159
that we liked

948
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,679
and then we would put a

949
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,600
link we would tell people what irc

950
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,880
server we were hanging out we were

951
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,000
hanging out on

952
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
and what chat room on that server well i

953
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,720
started joining other hacking groups uh

954
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,159
irc servers and their um chat rooms and

955
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,840
everything and that's how i

956
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,039
ended up stumbling across the um world

957
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
of hell hacking group in 2000

958
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,919
um at the time like i said fear hacksaw

959
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,839
crew was just hacking nothing but

960
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,960
really low-level websites and there was

961
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,839
a new

962
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,239
defacement mirror that came online that

963
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:16,879
was called

964
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,159
all das a-l-l-d-a-s-dot

965
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,839
d-e and this one showed a lot more

966
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,719
websites

967
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
from a lot more different hacking groups

968
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,480
than attrition did at the time

969
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,918
so i ended up coming across a

970
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,918
website that was hacked by the world of

971
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,960
health hackers

972
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,760
and it was what we called a high profile

973
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,359
website like it was a

974
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,440
it was a big company like a company that

975
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,199
everybody knew the name of

976
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,040
and um you had the ability to filter

977
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,560
the defaced websites by the

978
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,839
company the domain the hacking group

979
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,280
whether it was a high profile site or

980
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,640
just some random

981
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,960
crappy site and so i looked and saw that

982
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,599
every single website that world of hell

983
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,720
had hacked

984
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,760
was it was always a unix system

985
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
and they were all high-profile websites

986
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,040
it would be like

987
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,440
acer.com yahoo um hotmail

988
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,960
msn uh mercedes benz things like that

989
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,000
so to me that meant these guys were

990
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,720
really good

991
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,599
so i ended up joining their chat room

992
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,680
hanging out with them for a little while

993
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
and then we kind of like formed a little

994
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
bit of a bond between

995
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,119
the fear hacksaw crew and world of

996
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,000
health

997
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,720
and after a couple of months of being

998
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,760
separate groups

999
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,480
but still like kind of hacking together

1000
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,200
um

1001
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,839
one of the other like really active

1002
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,520
members of the hacking group

1003
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,440
um world of hell his name was rafa he uh

1004
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,760
sent me a direct message and he was like

1005
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
hey man would you be interested

1006
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,400
in leaving fear hacks or crew and coming

1007
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
over and joining world of hell with us

1008
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,440
because um i had started trying to

1009
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,119
basically mimic what they were doing

1010
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,680
i stopped looking for just hacking any

1011
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,960
website that i could

1012
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
could and started trying to target

1013
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,480
specific websites

1014
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,520
or high profile websites and

1015
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,400
i was like instantly i was like yes i'm

1016
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,800
in

1017
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,079
because back at this time um it was

1018
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,160
all about your exploits on what you were

1019
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,359
going to be able to

1020
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,480
hack with the exploits and uh world of

1021
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:28,880
hell

1022
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,920
had uh some guys that were extremely

1023
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,800
good at

1024
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,280
finding vulnerabilities and then writing

1025
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,119
the exploits to exploit those

1026
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,400
vulnerabilities

1027
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,000
and you didn't really share most of your

1028
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,079
exploits with anybody if they weren't in

1029
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,800
your group

1030
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,280
so i saw joining world of hell as a

1031
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,400
means to

1032
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,960
get access to a lot more tools a lot

1033
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,560
more exploits and

1034
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,839
everything so it was a no-brainer um

1035
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,640
the very first website that i hacked as

1036
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,079
part of world of hell

1037
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,760
was the uh virginia department of

1038
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,520
informational technology

1039
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,320
um server which housed the state of

1040
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,920
virginia the state that i live in

1041
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,040
it how housed our state website

1042
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,920
and um that was my very first one that

1043
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,000
was kind of like my inauguration

1044
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,119
into the group and from there it just

1045
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,000
it just blossomed past uh past that

1046
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,440
within a couple of months

1047
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,480
me and rafa every day all day

1048
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,880
unless i was in school me and him were

1049
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,320
talking to each other

1050
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,240
in private messages we would talk in the

1051
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,160
public chat room some and

1052
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,560
in our private group chat room but me

1053
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,200
and him were

1054
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,440
always talking in um private together

1055
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,720
and hacking together

1056
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,960
and it got to a point where the two of

1057
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,720
us were the

1058
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,040
the most well two most well-known people

1059
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,079
of the group

1060
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,560
and we kind of took over the leadership

1061
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,000
of the uh the group

1062
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,480
and we set some new rules back then

1063
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
windows was so easy to hack

1064
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
that we actually told members of world

1065
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
of help you're not allowed to hack

1066
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,520
windows it's too easy

1067
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,320
it doesn't take any uh any skill and

1068
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,839
anybody can do it so

1069
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,920
we wanted to build a name for ourselves

1070
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,960
as being

1071
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,320
the ones that went after the hard

1072
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
targets uh so

1073
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,520
that's what we did i ran the world of

1074
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
health hacking group with rapa

1075
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,320
up until um 2001.

1076
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,359
so in 2001 i turned 18 in november of

1077
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,800
2001

1078
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
and um being a kid and not really

1079
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
understanding the law and everything

1080
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,880
like that

1081
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,920
i thought mistakenly that if

1082
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,599
i um stopped hacking when i turned 18

1083
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,280
that i couldn't get in trouble for

1084
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
things that i did as a kid

1085
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,040
i thought that as soon as i turned 18 it

1086
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,960
would magically make it so all of the

1087
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,240
stuff i had done

1088
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
prior to that like they could never get

1089
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,320
me in trouble for it

1090
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,359
and uh so for the last month or so

1091
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,880
before i turned 18

1092
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,359
me and rafa went all in trying to hack

1093
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,000
like as much stuff as we could we had

1094
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
major pharmaceutical companies us

1095
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,119
government

1096
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,640
military computer systems um microsoft

1097
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,040
websites and things like that

1098
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,520
and um well up until my 18th birthday

1099
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,800
the day before my 18th birthday i

1100
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,079
did kind of like a last hurrah and uh

1101
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,480
my planning was to hack that day and

1102
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,119
then

1103
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,000
stop after that well it didn't really

1104
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,040
work out that way

1105
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,000
and uh i still continue to hack a little

1106
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,520
bit i didn't hack quite as much

1107
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
because i had gotten into playing some

1108
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,720
games like uh

1109
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,280
team fortress and stuff like that so i

1110
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,240
started playing

1111
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,720
some more uh games a little bit more

1112
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,920
instead of

1113
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,640
focusing every bit of my waking hours uh

1114
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,839
to hacking

1115
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,280
uh that lasted for maybe maybe a month

1116
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,839
or so

1117
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,800
and then i got kind of bored and i was

1118
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,240
no longer getting the

1119
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,280
the rush of hacking these computers and

1120
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
getting that

1121
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,880
root shell uh prompt when you

1122
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,960
successfully exploited the system

1123
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,839
and um i've told people for a long time

1124
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,160
that

1125
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,440
to me hacking was always like a drug um

1126
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,720
the rush the adrenaline rush and the

1127
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,640
quote unquote high that we would get

1128
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,920
after doing this

1129
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,160
um was just like doing any other drugs

1130
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,440
and it was just

1131
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,800
tons of fun for us um i continued to do

1132
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,359
this

1133
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,280
until uh june 12th of 2002

1134
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,640
i was working and um

1135
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,560
i had downloaded the night before i had

1136
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,880
downloaded the movie men in black 2

1137
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,720
online and the plan was to go to work

1138
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,520
the next day pretend that i was sick and

1139
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,560
then

1140
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,800
get sent home early so that i could

1141
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,760
watch the movie

1142
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,000
and then like just hang out for the rest

1143
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,040
of the day so

1144
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,359
i'm at work and pretending to be sick

1145
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,280
and around noon that day

1146
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,800
my uh boss agreed to let me go home

1147
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,000
so i ran out jumped in my car and drove

1148
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,480
home

1149
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
when i pulled into my apartment complex

1150
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
that i was living in at the time

1151
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,240
the um at the time i didn't realize it

1152
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,640
but the parking lot was completely empty

1153
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,560
there wasn't a single car

1154
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,680
anywhere around my building which in

1155
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,359
hindsight it was really weird

1156
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,839
because there was always some cars

1157
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,800
parked there

1158
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,680
but this time there weren't i walked up

1159
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,359
the steps to my apartment

1160
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,359
i put my key in the door i tried to

1161
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,760
unlock it and i went to open the door

1162
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,960
but it didn't open

1163
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,599
my front door had two locks one dead

1164
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,599
bolt that could be open from the outside

1165
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,280
and the other deadbolt that could only

1166
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,040
be open from the inside

1167
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,359
so i started banging on the door and

1168
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,720
yelling from my sister

1169
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
my parents were at work so they weren't

1170
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,880
home and i was banging on the door and i

1171
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,160
yelled to my sister

1172
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,000
you better not be in there smoking

1173
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,160
without me referring to smoking weed

1174
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,760
because i plan to go home smoke weed and

1175
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,920
watch this movie well the next thing i

1176
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,640
know i hear

1177
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,800
the little click of the lock being

1178
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,880
unlocked and i went to open it and the

1179
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,640
door was ripped out of my hands because

1180
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,079
it was ripped open

1181
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,960
and standing in my house was the fbi i

1182
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
don't know how many agents it was it was

1183
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,839
at least like

1184
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,119
15 or 20 agents they all had their

1185
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,160
like m16s when they ripped the door open

1186
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,040
in front of me

1187
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,680
they had a gun pointed into my face they

1188
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,359
pulled me into my apartment

1189
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,520
put me up against the wall patted me

1190
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,599
down and everything and led me into the

1191
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,839
living room when i got into the living

1192
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,000
room uh my sister was sitting on the

1193
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,800
couch

1194
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,920
and my dad was there i didn't know that

1195
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,319
he was there but apparently when the fbi

1196
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,520
showed up

1197
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,640
my sister was a miner too and um they

1198
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,760
forced her to

1199
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,240
call her parents my mom was somewhere

1200
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,880
off

1201
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,960
working and couldn't be reached so my

1202
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
sister had called my dad my dad got

1203
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,440
there

1204
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,079
as fast as he could and they were ready

1205
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,119
in my house

1206
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,000
and they ended up sitting me down and um

1207
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,760
i i was beyond scared and

1208
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,520
didn't really understand all of what was

1209
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,599
going on and they started wanting to ask

1210
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,599
me questions and everything and

1211
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,280
i told them that i didn't want to answer

1212
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,040
any questions without a warrior

1213
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,359
and then they told me well if you're

1214
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,560
forcing to be

1215
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,720
um if you're gonna force to have a uh

1216
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,000
con a lawyer then we're not gonna help

1217
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,800
you uh when it comes time to giving a

1218
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,400
good word for the judge and everything

1219
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,319
like that so my dad

1220
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,880
was all like you better answer all the

1221
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,560
questions that they ask you

1222
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,520
and everything so i sat there and i

1223
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,079
admitted

1224
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,440
that yes i was dog eg i was the leader

1225
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,200
of world of hell the world of health

1226
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,160
hacking group

1227
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,280
and everything and um they

1228
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,880
continued to ask me questions i would

1229
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,560
answer some i would not answer some

1230
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
pretending that i didn't didn't remember

1231
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,280
the answer

1232
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,800
or something along those lines and they

1233
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,240
searched the house they took all the

1234
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,400
computers every scrap piece of paper

1235
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,079
that had handwritten notes

1236
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,599
anything that they thought could

1237
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,000
potentially help give them

1238
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,200
evidence to convict me

1239
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,960
and surprisingly enough they didn't

1240
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,200
actually arrest me or to take me into

1241
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,160
custody that day

1242
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,119
they charged me and they put me on

1243
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,680
something called pretrial services

1244
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,079
that's basically probation before you go

1245
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,119
to court

1246
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,319
um i spent a year and a half on

1247
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,040
pre-trial and during this time i was

1248
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,520
banned from touching a computer

1249
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,960
and for about the first six months or so

1250
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
i i stayed off the computer like

1251
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,640
completely i wasn't allowed to touch one

1252
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,760
at all anyway

1253
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
but i i actually listened and stayed off

1254
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,160
the computer completely

1255
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,560
but then after the six months i started

1256
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,599
to get bored so

1257
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,040
when my mom would go to sleep i would

1258
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,640
sneak on the computer again

1259
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,240
and it it just blossomed from getting on

1260
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,319
for an hour to at night when everybody

1261
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,680
was asleep to

1262
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,839
staying online all the time again and i

1263
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,440
joined another hacking group

1264
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,720
called hackwiser hackwiser i joined them

1265
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,040
under a different name i used the name

1266
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,960
the unknown hacker

1267
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
because i didn't want nobody to know who

1268
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,720
i was the only two people

1269
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,359
that knew who i really was in that group

1270
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,760
was a guy named hackajack a hacker

1271
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,319
in cincinnati ohio and his online

1272
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,760
girlfriend fizz

1273
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,880
um i started hacking together with them

1274
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,880
and at the time i didn't know it but

1275
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,640
they had been arrested too

1276
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,839
and they were sitting with the fbi and

1277
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,160
they were asking me to hack specific

1278
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,040
websites

1279
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,200
i would hack the website then give them

1280
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,160
access

1281
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,359
and then they basically used me to get

1282
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,400
out of trouble

1283
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,079
and help lower their sentence um

1284
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,319
i originally was supposed to get six

1285
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,680
months of what they call

1286
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,319
shock incarceration or a boot camp and

1287
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,160
then six months of probation

1288
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,480
and then or six months of house arrest

1289
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,640
and then five years of probation

1290
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,160
um but because i didn't listen and

1291
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,920
didn't stay off the computer and started

1292
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,680
hacking again when i

1293
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,800
um went to court on january 23

1294
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,319
of 2004 they uh

1295
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,640
they sentenced me and i went into court

1296
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,960
that day thinking that i was gonna get

1297
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,280
um sentenced but then have a month until

1298
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,640
i had to self-report

1299
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,000
they sentenced me to two and a half

1300
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,760
years in federal prison

1301
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,079
and banned me from touching a computer

1302
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,680
for um

1303
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,480
i think it was five years at first and

1304
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,160
instead of giving me a month to turn

1305
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,680
myself into the prison

1306
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,800
they took me right away right that day

1307
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,640
and they took me to federal prison

1308
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,200
um i accidentally skipped the part about

1309
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,640
my first arrest for

1310
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,760
hacking and stuff in 2000 but because

1311
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,040
of another charge that i got during that

1312
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,440
first arrest in april of 2000

1313
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,560
the u.s federal government considered me

1314
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:56,880
a

1315
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,880
violent criminal and instead of going to

1316
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,319
a camp or a low-level

1317
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,520
uh security prison to do my time they

1318
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,560
classified me

1319
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,920
as a high severity inmate

1320
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,720
and put me in medium high and maximum

1321
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
security federal prisons

1322
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,960
i stayed in federal prison in that time

1323
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,880
until 2006

1324
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,480
i was released on january 6 2006

1325
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,640
and i was on probation i wasn't allowed

1326
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,960
to touch computers or anything like that

1327
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,720
uh for the first month i stayed off

1328
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,960
computers and then after a month it was

1329
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,480
right back just like before

1330
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,240
i started sneaking on a computer a

1331
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,760
little bit here and there i would go to

1332
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,520
the library and use it

1333
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,000
and then it got to the point where i

1334
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,760
didn't really care anymore and i just

1335
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,079
always stayed on the computer when my

1336
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,839
probation officer would show up at my

1337
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:48,480
house

1338
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,559
when i saw him pull into the driveway i

1339
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,800
would rush and hide all my computers

1340
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,880
like in closets under the bed and stuff

1341
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,920
like that

1342
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,359
and um in april of 2007

1343
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,480
i forgot to hide um

1344
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,559
one of the pieces when he showed up and

1345
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,319
he walked into my bedroom and he saw a

1346
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,640
keyboard and a mouse sitting on my bed

1347
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,200
and to him that was enough proof that i

1348
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,480
had a computer

1349
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,359
so he violated my probation that time he

1350
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,520
sent me back to federal prison for 10

1351
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,400
months

1352
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,720
i did those 10 months was released in

1353
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,280
february of 2008.

1354
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,359
um once again i was banned from

1355
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,520
computers but i didn't listen again

1356
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,599
i started getting on the computer again

1357
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,280
right after my release

1358
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,040
and uh a year after my release one of my

1359
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,200
co-defendants from my original

1360
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,240
hacking he started being a hacker a bad

1361
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,440
hacker again

1362
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,160
and uh a girl i broke up with called the

1363
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,760
fbi and told them

1364
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,280
because she was mad at me and knew i

1365
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,880
wasn't allowed on the computer she

1366
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,800
called the fbi and told them that i was

1367
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,240
back on the computer and that i was

1368
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,960
hacking

1369
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,359
and everything again so they spent six

1370
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,200
months watching my house

1371
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,200
and monitoring my internet connection

1372
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,640
and found out that i was

1373
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,200
actually hacking again and they raided

1374
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,640
my house again in october of 2009

1375
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,640
and sent me back to federal prison for

1376
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,319
another 14 months

1377
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,079
i was released from federal prison the

1378
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,160
last time in january

1379
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,200
or november of 2010

1380
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,319
um upon my release because they

1381
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,160
killed my probation i was no longer on

1382
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,480
probation they removed my

1383
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,240
limitation of not being able to be on a

1384
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,880
computer anymore

1385
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,559
once they did that i started looking for

1386
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,240
an ig job but

1387
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,160
it was extremely difficult to find one

1388
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,000
because i had been convicted of

1389
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,200
the cfa cfaa which is the computer fraud

1390
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,640
and abuse act

1391
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,440
um that's the computer laws here in the

1392
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,720
us

1393
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,640
i finally found a company in june of

1394
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,040
2013

1395
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,920
that agreed to hire me as their unix

1396
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,200
system admin

1397
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,319
i stayed with this company as a their

1398
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,319
sys admin and developer from 2013

1399
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,040
until 2016. 2016 i was introduced to the

1400
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,760
world of

1401
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,960
bug bounties i submitted my first

1402
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,240
vulnerability to

1403
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,760
the um yahoo program on hackerone

1404
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,800
and it got accepted in march of 2016 and

1405
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,240
they paid me 300

1406
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,599
for it and at that point i knew what i

1407
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,160
wanted to do for the rest of my life

1408
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,720
now i was able to hack but instead of

1409
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,240
them sending me to prison

1410
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,839
they were gonna pay me so i stayed at my

1411
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,760
job for about six months and was doing

1412
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,880
bug bounties

1413
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,440
in my free time and after six months i

1414
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,359
realized that i'm making a lot more

1415
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,119
money or i have the ability to make a

1416
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,240
lot more money

1417
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
doing the bug bounty stuff than i was as

1418
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,359
a system admin

1419
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,640
so in 2017 i

1420
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,119
transitioned i quit my jobs and started

1421
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,440
being a full-time bug bounty hunter

1422
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,599
which i did is uh i

1423
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,839
did full-time bug bounty hunting up

1424
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:00,640
until

1425
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,880
um actually december of last year i

1426
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,520
got a job with a company called breeze

1427
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,079
that i s

1428
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,960
i'm still uh working with raise now but

1429
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,079
uh

1430
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,160
i did bug bounties full time from 2017

1431
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,000
to the end of 2020.

1432
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,440
in 2016 i only made about 30 thousand

1433
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,000
dollars

1434
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,760
doing bug bounties part time in 2017

1435
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,319
i made right about a hundred thousand

1436
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,280
dollars

1437
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,760
uh for the first time and 2018 i really

1438
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,359
started focusing on it

1439
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,599
a lot more i changed up my approach to

1440
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,920
how i was doing the hacking

1441
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,280
and that was my first really good year i

1442
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,559
made a couple of hundred thousand

1443
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,359
dollars

1444
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,240
in 2018 and then in 2019

1445
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,760
um i had my best year i made roughly

1446
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,119
900 000 in 2019

1447
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,559
just from bug bounties and last year

1448
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,319
i think i ended up doing about four or

1449
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,079
five hundred thousand dollars

1450
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,200
in um bounties um because of

1451
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,720
cove and a lot of programs uh started

1452
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,200
lowering their payments and everything

1453
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:13,839
so

1454
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,960
i didn't quite make as much and um

1455
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,520
here's

1456
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,720
some stuff currently i am the uh ranked

1457
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,000
number 23

1458
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,720
on hacker one out of hundreds of

1459
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,319
thousands of different hackers

1460
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,520
i'm ranked 280th on bug crowd since i

1461
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,280
don't spend as much time on there

1462
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,400
and i'm currently ranked 19th out of the

1463
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,880
i think there's maybe a couple thousand

1464
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,400
hackers on senec

1465
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,040
and i've made roughly 2.5 million

1466
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,119
dollars maybe a little bit more

1467
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,520
across all the platforms and everything

1468
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,960
when it comes

1469
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,240
to bug bounties um let's see what's this

1470
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,119
next class

1471
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,960
um some of the achievements that i've

1472
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,720
been able to get now

1473
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,599
like in the bug bounties last year in

1474
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,079
february of 2020 um

1475
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,760
hacker one does these live hacking

1476
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,760
events and um

1477
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,280
the target during the last the h1 415

1478
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,640
was verizon media which is the

1479
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,720
program that i do most of my hacking for

1480
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,400
they're responsible for

1481
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,760
roughly 1.8 million dollars of my total

1482
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,480
income

1483
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,680
from bug bounties um and i won

1484
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,480
the most valuable hacker which gave me a

1485
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,240
little

1486
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,880
wwe style wrestling belt

1487
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,000

1488
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,800

1489
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,760
um

1490
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,680
achieved like that reward is for and

1491
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,040
then the assassin

1492
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,680
which i think was getting the most valid

1493
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,240
bugs

1494
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,680
or something along those lines and um

1495
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,640
yeah uh i've that's pretty much what i

1496
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,000

and i'm getting to work with a bunch of

1501
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,280
really good hackers helping secure

1502
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,079
my company systems and learning a bunch

1503
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,040
from them

1504
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,079

basically my life story

1507
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,640
this time went by a whole lot faster

1508
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,000
than i was expecting so

1509
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,119
i'm sure i left out a few things here

1510
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:21,760
and there

1511
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,640
um but yeah i didn't realize the time

1512
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,400
was going to go by quite as fast as it

1513
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,119
did

1514
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,559
but uh yeah

1515
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,359
i think there's going to be some

1516
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,319
questions

1517
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,480
that uh some people have submitted

1518
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,520
or something hello

1519
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,920
and hello again um i'm going to

1520
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,119
um find them just a second

1521
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,240
no problem at all okay and thank you for

1522
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:52,799
your

1523
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,680
talk it was really interesting and

1524
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,960
fascinating in a way

1525
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,079
that you can actually come back from the

1526
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,280
black hat works so

1527
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,040
what do you think you can learn from

1528
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,400
being a black hat

1529
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,799
that a white hat could never learn

1530
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,799
um well when it comes to being a white

1531
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,960
hat and following bug bounty programs

1532
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,480
you have what's called a scope

1533
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,440
and at times the scope can be extremely

1534
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,160
limited

1535
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,160
um telling you what you can and can't

1536
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,280
hack but

1537
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,280
being a black cat you don't care what

1538
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,319
the scope is

1539
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,680
so you're able to explore and hack a lot

1540
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,359
of things that you would otherwise

1541
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,119
not be able to legally hack and

1542
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,440
i think that my experience as a black

1543
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,240
cat

1544
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,160
because of things like that and being

1545
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,000
able to experience

1546
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,599
um a lot more of different things that i

1547
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,839
was hacking throughout all of my time

1548
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,240
that it's contributed to help make me as

1549
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,799
successful as i am today

1550
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,599
okay so the next question is did you

1551
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,200
have any run-ins

1552
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,359
uh with ir irc

1553
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,720
ops um sorry i'm used to talking

1554
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,160
in finnish so um with the irc

1555
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,359
ops um occasionally yeah um

1556
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,640
so one of the members of tdk our hacking

1557
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,200
group

1558
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,160
was actually an offer from one of the

1559
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,640
f-net

1560
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,520
servers so he did his best a lot of

1561
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,520
times to protect us and make sure we

1562
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,799
didn't get in trouble

1563
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,079
um at the time in the 90s most people

1564
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,960
most of the operas on fnet didn't really

1565
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,480
care what we were doing

1566
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,880
as long as we didn't go after like

1567
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,599
specific

1568
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,720
rooms that were frequented or owned by

1569
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,920
them or their friends

1570
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,640
so as long as we were sticking to like

1571
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,359
the shells channels the where's channels

1572
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:49,359
and like team chat um cyber chat

1573
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,160
uh chat zone things like that they

1574
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,559
didn't

1575
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,319
really care as long as we didn't go and

1576
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,680
steal theirs

1577
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,799
and we didn't like basically harass

1578
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,799
everybody

1579
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,920
okay so i think we have one more

1580
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,400
time for one more question i think i

1581
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,359
picked this one

1582
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,520
how do your parents feel about your

1583
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,520
career now

1584
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,720
um now they're extremely happy um for a

1585
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,760
long time

1586
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,000
both them and i thought that i had

1587
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,760
effectively ruined my life

1588
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,200
um if things now were the same as they

1589
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,040
were in the 90s then my life would have

1590
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,000
been ruined but

1591
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,920
luckily um over the last several years

1592
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,880
we've been able to convince not the

1593
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,799
entire world but a lot of people

1594
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,480
that not all hackers are bad um

1595
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,839
just because people made mistakes in the

1596
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:42,480
past

1597
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,640
doesn't mean that they haven't changed i

1598
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,200
have changed a lot since i was

1599
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,040
a black hat hacker i now have a

1600
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,400
four-year-old daughter

1601
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,960
that is one of my biggest motivating

1602
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,000
factors to make sure

1603
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,599
i never do anything illegal again

1604
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,880
i make sure that i

1605
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,960
don't violate to the best of my ability

1606
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,880
i make sure i don't violate any rules

1607
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,240
when it comes to bug bounties

1608
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,680
because if i get caught illegally

1609
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,839
hacking again it's life in prison

1610
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,400
so my parents are extremely happy that

1611
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,200
i've gone

1612
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,640
from what we thought was a life

1613
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,920
ruining event to being able to turn it

1614
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,400
around

1615
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,599
and become extremely successful doing

1616
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,520
not only something that i love but

1617
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,640
something that also

1618
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,839
helps other people and helps secure

1619
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,640
systems to protect people's data and

1620
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,280
provide

1621
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,280
a really good life for my daughter

1622
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,400
okay thank you so much for your time it

1623
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,280
i hope we would have more time for you

1624
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,160
but i think

1625
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,880
next we're going to have a little break

1626
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,839
and then continue with our last talk

1627
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:50,559
could i say

1628
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,720
one more thing really quick is kind of

1629
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,559
something to lose

1630
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,359
um the biggest takeaway i want uh people

1631
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,960
to get from this especially

1632
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,559
young upcoming hackers is don't make the

1633
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,000
mistakes that i did going

1634
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,200
down the black cat route nowadays you

1635
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,680
have so many opportunities to do this

1636
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,119
legally and make a lot of money doing it

1637
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,200
that the risk of doing it as a black

1638
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,400
cat's not worth it

1639
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,200
you have bug bounty programs you have

1640
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,160
bone hub

1641
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,000
and um try to hack various places that

1642
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,640
let you legally hack them to learn and

1643
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,240
explore your curiosity

1644
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,720
without breaking the law and i highly

1645
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,040
recommend people to take that route

1646
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,079
versus

1647
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,000
the blackout route because you don't

1648
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,280
want to go to prison

1649
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,839
for being a hacker especially when you

1650
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,319
have so many opportunities in the world

1651
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:47,520
to do this legally and to help people

1652
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,079
yeah that's really good and sound advice

1653
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:50,880
i'm

1654
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,920
really up for that one and so

1655
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,160
i think we can continue with the next

1656
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,879
talk and

1657
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,440
thank you very much for uh having me if

1658

i didn't get a chance to address or

1663
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,359

1664
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,839
yeah are you actually in the server

1665
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:16,880
which we have for

1666

1667
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,119
more questions

1668
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,319
yeah yeah so we can actually continue

1669
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,040
a couple of weeks to uh for anybody that

1670
