1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:09,719
all right hello everybody

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,080
honey y'all are amazing for being here

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,030
it's like you're you survived Friday

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,710
night and you also didn't go to the

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,198
Bayou Boogaloo that's going on right now

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,789
to here so I appreciate that

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,500
this is my standard disclaimer what I'm

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,189
doing off into talks but this is more

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,179
like a rant offensive talk so but just

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,590
remember when I talk about the bad

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,809
stories and the thing the people that

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,700
I've robbed in this it's like it was

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,099
with a contract okay so I'm adorable

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,620
remember the kittens it's like I didn't

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,390
try to hack anybody or steal from them

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,839
unless they paid me first so there's

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,440
always a contract this is the title of

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,829
the talk I put on the pony not basically

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
what it's beat what's the theme of it is

20
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,649
I'm going to tell you some of the things

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,599
that piss me off when I'm trying to rob

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,239
someone it's like and the things that I

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,739
love what I'm trying to rob someone it's

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,048
like so the things that they'd be right

25
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,750
and the things that they'd be wrong and

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,950
then a little bit more at the end about

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,470
what we can do about it

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,970
so if you don't know anything about me

29
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,700
this is the least important slide of the

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,650
deck you can go search for other stuff

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,320
but just know that it's like there's me

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,360
in the upper left by robbing the bank in

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,610
Beirut for National Geographic being on

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,229
the news and but most important none of

35
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,920
that matters except the lower left-hand

36
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,570
corner those are actual steals of me

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,130
robbing people and stealing computer

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,380
equipment from behind a bank teller line

39
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,820
because that's what I do it's like I

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,339
like to help secure people by educating

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,189
them on flaws and their systems and the

42
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,070
best way to show that is by robbing them

43
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,039
so so that's an effective procedure

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,130
actually so it's like it works so let's

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,030
go a little bit more but what I do not

46
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,179
do is I do not do advanced techniques I

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,149
do not do the cool I mean you're gonna

48
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,380
see probably right after this talk so

49
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,670
you know people talking about all their

50
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,920
ninja skills and their leaked red

51
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,209
teaming acting abilities and and how

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,970
they go in and do all these really

53
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,920
that's awesome okay it's like and that's

54
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,630
really great

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,980
and you go and you see talks at

56
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,910
conferences we're taught people are

57
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,590
talking about oh I did this

58
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,270
vulnerability in this buffer overflow in

59
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,760
this one process it's like you know in

60
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,690
this obscure systems like wah wah and

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm like that's awesome I spend less

62
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,380
than two hours on Google and I walk in

63
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,359
the front door without never being in

64
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:41,250
there before and I still everything so

65
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,220
not very technical it's like but it

66
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,780
works it's like and when we go and we

67
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,359
get to our clients and we tell our

68
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,560
clients it's like these are all the the

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,209
process and this is what I've learned

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,769
over the years it's like we tell them

71
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,650
that we've done all these really cool

72
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,590
elite ninja skill things and they're go

73
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,510
and go oh that's awesome

74
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,459
because I was worried about we'd have to

75
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,230
change something but you're like this

76
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,850
leet ninja person I don't have to worry

77
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,988
about you you're not my threat model

78
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,519
it's like so I

79
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,140
okay we don't have to change anything we

80
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,060
just we just lost I mean of course we're

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,260
gonna lose you were a met you were like

82
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,030
awesome so I realized that's not a good

83
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,820
way to approach it - you're at upper

84
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,190
management so what I do is I do it the

85
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,799
opposite I gonna let look mother I just

86
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,630
walked in looking like this I literally

87
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,760
I've broken into a server room before

88
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,720
with a shirt that said hacker on it and

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,280
they let me in that's a problem if I

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,920
stop trying to act and let go like oh

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,170
whoa whoa we can know your threat model

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,609
is a guy walking off the street never

93
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,410
being in your building in the country

94
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,480
that they've never been in before

95
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,859
and getting into your server room that's

96
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,170
an issue that you now have to resolve

97
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,200
because that's what I did so it's like

98
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,660
fix those things think the people issues

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,768
fixed how the users are approaching it

100
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,700
fix how your environment is and what you

101
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,730
think is secure

102
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,250
there is nothing but the least secured

103
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,760
that I've ever seen something is not

104
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,799
people that have no sense of security

105
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,108
it's like it's the people that had the

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,820
false sense of security

107
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,168
that's the most least secure thing it's

108
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,000
like because they feel like they're

109
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,010
protected I was able to get into a

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,590
building right across the street from

111
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,020
Ground Zero the financial center it's

112
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,539
like in downtown Manhattan and it was

113
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,750
like guards everywhere it's like

114
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,640
there I was up Neil upstairs bypassed

115
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,800
all that got upstairs into the upper

116
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,490
floors and I had free range of

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,430
everything

118
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,060
because everybody's like well he made it

119
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,070
up here he has to be okay I was not okay

120
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,320
it's like you know there was nothing

121
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,930
okay about that whole situation it's

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,430
like so that's what happens so we talked

123
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,020
about all this other stuff you know but

124
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,480
literally that's what that's what's

125
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,950
getting your users that lower right

126
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,170
corner that's what your users are

127
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,940
falling for it's like it doesn't have to

128
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,250
be obscure it doesn't have to be

129
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,710
advanced or some kind of advanced

130
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,810
persistent technique you know everybody

131
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,239
you know nobody likes to ban the apt out

132
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,410
you know the only Ben be apt out when

133
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,200
they're talking to the shareholders it's

134
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,540
like oh we got we got hit by a PT well

135
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,060
we a PT does not stand for advanced

136
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,060
persistent techniques okay let's be real

137
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,150
it's like it stands for adequate fishing

138
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,470
technique that's it period it's like

139
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,900
every time you hear someone getting hit

140
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,910
by a PT what happens like who comes down

141
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,690
to it's like Oh our user clicked on an

142
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:36,180
email yeah that was advanced thank you

143
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,969
so and that we got another problem with

144
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:43,500
our companies and our enterprises

145
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:45,000
because your CEO your CIO your CSS all

146
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,760
your all your executives and all your

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,390
seasoned those people that's like expect

148
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,310
the left that's what they want that's

149
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,140
what they need and knowing that is what

150
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,820
they need that's what they expect from

151
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,380
you to build that's what you need to

152
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,750
have that's where they need to do their

153
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,050
business from the only problem is their

154
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,760
budgets for the right you know it's like

155
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,990
well it's like okay I can get you that

156
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,500
it's like how much money you've got to

157
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,030
work with oh four bricks some hay in a

158
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,100
mule okay yeah well we'll try to make

159
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,320
that work that's like you know it's like

160
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,690
that's what you're given but you know

161
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,440
one of the things that you're not

162
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,080
putting into the equation we keep

163
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,810
looking

164
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,900
the budget for our blinky boxes we keep

165
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,900
looking for the budget for that new

166
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,489
laughs for that new IDs or IPs or any

167
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,900
other letters and numbers and it's like

168
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean that some of the new blinky boxes

169
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,770
have blue lights instead of red lights

170
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,430
which it's way cooler it's like that's

171
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,710
awesome

172
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,120
and that cost lots of money and we're

173
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,500
like okay we gotta put all that what

174
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,379
about the people how much money do we

175
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,199
need for that how much money do you need

176
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,000
to actually educate your users why don't

177
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,680
you say like put in that next blinky box

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,270
in it's like sorry for all the blinky

179
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,789
boxes vendors here it's like instead of

180
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,409
put in that next blinky box in why don't

181
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:04,449
you actually use some of that budget to

182
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:06,069
educate your users right off the bat on

183
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,319
how to do security awareness on how to

184
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,919
be aware of what's going on because one

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,759
of the first things that I love on an

186
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:19,270
engagement that I love to do is attack

187
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,310
the users I love that I remember the

188
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,099
kittens I'm but I love going out to the

189
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,710
users because they don't expect that

190
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:29,229
they don't feel empowered to do that

191
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:32,620
it's like I was on a location this year

192
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:35,050
it's like in January and they told me

193
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,460
that it's like and it was there was a

194
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,990
lot of pressure was like but like no one

195
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,150
had gotten into this building before I

196
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,430
was like well crap it's like what am I

197
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,839
gonna do now right and the reason why

198
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,190
was they were always going through all

199
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,839
the lobbies it turns out that all the

200
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,960
attackers were I did not go through the

201
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:53,259
lobby try to bypass all that it's like I

202
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,680
got a valid visitor's badge from the

203
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,870
downstairs lobby and then I used a

204
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,729
shoeshine guy to get me into the back

205
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,580
area to the loading dock area so I could

206
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,199
go up the freight elevator and so I'm

207
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,789
there inside the freight elevator

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,979
it's like and I'm on the phone with

209
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,089
someone it's like because you got to be

210
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,550
on the phone because that gives you the

211
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,500
authority as I'm on the phone and for 15

212
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,020
minutes because there's another locked

213
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,210
door and then a guy comes out an

214
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,609
employee comes out with the dolly and

215
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,900
all I do is goes like oh no don't worry

216
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,370
you don't have to you don't have to come

217
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,239
it's like someone's here you let me in

218
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,129
it's like I'll meet you at your office

219
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,960
it's like don't worry about it it's good

220
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,990
it's like he let me he's like cool and

221
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,919
he let me in was

222
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,930
supposed to do that no it's like he saw

223
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,459
a visitor's badge but it's obviously it

224
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,650
was a visitor's badge it was not that

225
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,910
employee badge but he made the

226
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,680
assumption he wasn't empowered to

227
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,180
actually stop me from doing it because I

228
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,890
was taking the authority of just going

229
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:55,900
in it's like I that next day I go in

230
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:58,569
with a cable a USB cable and I tell

231
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,040
people it's like oh I'm doing a USB rice

232
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,870
check and this is I already bypassed

233
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,319
everything so I'm already in it's like

234
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,910
and through everything now and I'm

235
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,350
actually trying to get caught it's like

236
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,670
I actually tried to get caught on my

237
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,600
engagements because you want to give

238
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,459
them a win you want to give them

239
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,660
something to look up to sometimes it

240
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,790
doesn't work out that way at first

241
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,800
though it's like so I have this cable

242
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,660
and I say look I'm testing your USB

243
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,920
policy rights to make sure that you're

244
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,150
not able to charge your devices from the

245
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,319
computers because that's against our

246
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,630
company policy that's why you have the

247
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,650
charging devices outlets right next to

248
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,050
your machine that's what you're supposed

249
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,090
to be using and so I need to plug this

250
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,109
cable and I test it so I plug in my USB

251
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:37,840
cable no phone attached it was literally

252
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,020
just the cable I then reach into my suit

253
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,670
pocket and pull out a detonator okay I

254
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,470
mean it's literally a square little

255
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,339
blinky like thing with an antenna on it

256
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:51,610
and I make the whole thing of going you

257
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:55,270
know pushing the button all of a sudden

258
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,670
on their machine notepad pops up and it

259
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,550
automatically types this test completed

260
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:10,199
successfully thank you for cooperation

261
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:10,199
smiley face emoji okay how is that legit

262
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,850
think about that for a second you

263
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:20,800
plugged in a cable and my notepad popped

264
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,090
up you know I mean it's 10 o'clock in

265
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,770
the morning New Orleans it's like even

266
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm thinking that's little sketchy right

267
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm not operating at 100% at the moment

268
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,450
it's like sorry it's like some spoiler

269
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,380
alert but it's like still and I did that

270
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:37,420
to eight people all in the same area the

271
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,820
guy who was with me who's watching his

272
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,979
face his the job was on the floor he's

273
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,330
like what the mic don't don't look at me

274
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,430
I don't know what happened either it's

275
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,730
like that was a supposed

276
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,410
work that way I mean I literally had to

277
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,940
keep going to a couple more places till

278
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,819
I finally got someone to stop me and go

279
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,620
no you're not not sticking that in my my

280
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,390
machine I'm like that's exactly the way

281
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,670
you're supposed to say it's like thank

282
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,830
you for that but those people were not

283
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,089
empowered they did not they felt secured

284
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,670
they felt they were in a secured

285
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,710
environment they felt they were in a

286
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,420
secured place so therefore they did they

287
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,090
could have their guard down they could

288
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,910
trust the people that were there it's

289
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:18,660
like that was not on just on them

290
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,760
that's not blaming the user that wasn't

291
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,589
a stupid user that let me compromise

292
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:27,510
them that was an untrained user that was

293
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,250
the fault of information security for

294
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,319
not properly training their users on

295
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,860
what to expect and making them feel

296
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,540
comfortable to say no making them

297
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,800
comfortable to say I know you're not

298
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,360
supposed to be on my machine it's like I

299
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,319
need authorization for that it's like

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,420
we're not supposed to be plugging things

301
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,170
into our computers you need to be able

302
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,180
to sure your employees know those things

303
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:51,060
let's go to one of things I hate

304
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,160

356
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,670
non-threatening well you know at least

357
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,170
in his attitudes it's like its presence

358
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,490
was threatening okay but it's like as

359
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,610
Lisa's attitude it's like they give him

360
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,560
like it was like he was wearing dark

361
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,450
black pants and it's like in a black

362
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,130
shirt that was three sizes too small or

363
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,350
his muscles were forced times too big I

364
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,880
don't know which but it's like slow so

365
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,860
he didn't have to really you know be

366
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,959
that intimidating a person he was just

367
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,320
like he was existing so that was enough

368
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,729
and so I was like because with me and

369
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,260
I'm like oh so I go to the front desk

370
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,510
and I register with the password they

371
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,370
verify someone's there and then I can go

372
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,520
sit on the couch couch is only for

373
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,190
verified visitors I found out so but

374
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,250
that whole Lobby area was there was no

375
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,649
place I could go without being detected

376
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,350
by one of the two security people it's

377
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:36,029
like and as soon as I went in I mean I

378
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,649
do look sketch eaf most of the time

379
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,959
anyway so it's like I'm sure that didn't

380
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:41,550
help my my presence but as soon as I

381
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,390
walked through that door they were like

382
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,790
right there

383
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,110
being dominant like okay I see you it's

384
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,689
like and that's how your lobbies are

385
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,450
supposed to be it's like when I bring

386
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:55,790
that other building on the second day

387
00:14:51,450 --> 00:15:00,300
what I did was I took a copy of the

388
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:03,750
visitor's badge and all I did was from

389
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,969
that picture printed that out on a paper

390
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,650
on a piece of paper not there thick

391
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,900
cardstock or anything it was literally

392
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,910
just a piece of paper that was then cut

393
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,010
out to match the size of the bag

394
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,250
it's like an had my name on it and the

395
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,720
next day's date it's like in the same

396
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,910
number system and everything else as the

397
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,430
other badge and so I literally just went

398
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,750
up the escalators up to the the second

399
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,520
floor where the bathroom was because I

400
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,890
found that out on the first day and then

401
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,390
I come back down the escalators so now

402
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm coming from a position of not coming

403
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,240
in from the outside I'm coming from

404
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,069
somewhere on the inside and I just

405
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,080
walked right by the guards going oh yeah

406
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,820
here's my badge you know it's like

407
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,040
without being author you know without

408
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,390
them understanding so it's like because

409
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,430
they weren't paying attention

410
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,870
they were just letting anybody go they

411
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,209
weren't being active they weren't like

412
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,690
actively looking or trying to like make

413
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:54,480
an ingress ingress point for visitors

414
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,850
and that's what that's what let me do

415
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,010
that it's like but cuz person is like no

416
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,320
they monitored they let you know I see

417
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,800
you you need to verify it's like and

418
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,930
they'll go ask you for you just water so

419
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,969
one of the one of the things I do love

420
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,219
of course and every attacker loves is a

421
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,690
total lack of egress filtering or

422
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,280
monitoring and if you ever want to talk

423
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,110
about security theater you have to

424
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,230
actually include the TSA because I mean

425
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,150
that's part of the job and I mean I do

426
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,530
have a hate-hate relationship but don't

427
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,860
worry it's like trust me for some of the

428
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:29,430
the cop freedom fondles I've gotten they

429
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:33,840
hate me too and but that's one of our

430
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:35,939
problems is that these guys are not they

431
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,750
said what was that 70 percent of the

432
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:43,260
mock weapons made it through their

433
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:46,760
inspection but mother no four ounce

434
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,840
bottle of toothpaste ever did did it

435
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,670
they'll get you on the floor you try

436
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,230
with that six ounce okay trust me it's

437
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,740
like you know that that's a national

438
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,750
threat right there it's like and I mean

439
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,010
there was that one time with the shampoo

440
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,080
that we're not going to discuss because

441
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,030
I'm still hurting from that one but it's

442
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,270
a but that's the problem it's like how

443
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:11,700
are they monitoring are you monitoring

444
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:13,889
what data leaves your network Sony sorry

445
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:17,970
to pick on Sony but I mean everybody

446
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:22,920
else did seems it seems like allowed one

447
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:24,640
point three terabytes of data to leave

448
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,049
their network

449
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,820
headed toward South America and not like

450
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,230
you know a lot like Paraguay which do

451
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,519
you know which you know usually it's war

452
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,710
all that data goes I guess it's like

453
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:39,250
somewhere else somewhere unusual offer

454
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,500
them are you gonna miss one point three

455
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:46,029
terabytes of data leaving your network

456
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,799
and not go hmm that's strange it's like

457
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:49,750
the whole catalogue for all the

458
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,750
different movies that we ever made seem

459
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,919
to be leaving in our network make sure

460
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,450
we got the bandwidth for that you know

461
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,580
it's like make sure we get the we open

462
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,019
up that pipeline it's like you know one

463
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,539
question why that data was being

464
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:03,460
exfiltrated I have one of my payloads

465
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:06,789
that I do not test on my rubber ducky

466
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,909
and it's very simple what it does is it

467
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:10,539
opens up telnet and it telnet to you

468
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:14,139
know

469
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:20,529
Talyn key lights dot NL and it runs

470
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:24,250
ASCII Star Wars why is your guy in

471
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:31,299
accounting having telnet access to

472
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:34,090
Amsterdam why and if that you do allow

473
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,740
telling that access to Amsterdam but why

474
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,459
aren't you at his desk within five

475
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,169
minutes going what are you doing I did

476
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,370
have one engagement where someone didn't

477
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:43,720
actually do that it's like I was going

478
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,439
to the server and it was from an

479
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,169
assistant from the CFO and they did show

480
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,279
they were monitoring bandwidth it's like

481
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:53,110
they did do a good job of that I mean

482
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,679
I've gone another way but they still got

483
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,240
that they caught that they detected that

484
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,820
you have to monitor what's leaving your

485
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,179
network you have to block what's leaving

486
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,928
your network the worst rule and any

487
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:09,639
firewall is any kind of any any rule

488
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:12,669
that's always gonna end badly for you at

489
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:14,590
some point it's like every firewall rule

490
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:16,510
should be delivered with a policy or

491
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,730
procedure that goes with corresponds

492
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,399
with it it should not be just for ease

493
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,039
of access it's like you have to make

494
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:26,260
sure that your access your egress is was

495
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,059
monitored just as your ingress because

496
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,039
trust me it's like I am never coming

497
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,168
from the outside of your network but the

498
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:35,500
calls always coming from inside okay and

499
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:38,410
it's me so prepare for that and protect

500
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,710
against those outbound calls

501
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,960
but man one of the things I hate dual

502
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,550
factor author author

503
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,750
I can't even say right this is still too

504
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,399
early for me it's like you know it's

505
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,100
like too mad it's like I hate

506
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,950
multi-factor authentication I hate that

507
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,020
especially when it comes to doors oh my

508
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,700
gosh there is this one in case I thought

509
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,710
was awesome it's like was like a really

510
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,900
cool I got in that was I all all great

511
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:07,530
everything was going well you know what

512
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:12,490
those ingrates did they put access doors

513
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:15,940
with inside the company what though oh

514
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,830
my I'm all like I've got it I'm like all

515
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,180
good and I'm like I'm walking around I'm

516
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,649
like oh I gotta act like I'm cool now

517
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,870
cuz it's like I don't have a way to get

518
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,880
out of this area it's like there's like

519
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,870
there's a whole range of cubicles and

520
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,760
it's like eventually someone's gonna

521
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,489
knows like who's that guy he's been here

522
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,070
for like an hour it's like it's like

523
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,380
that's gonna be odd it's like so it's

524
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,800
like so I mean that slows an attacker

525
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,630
down it's like I mean the whole freaking

526
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,120
floor was a man trap I did not

527
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,640
appreciate that it's like I mean that

528
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,649
was not cool it's like I mean it was

529
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,080
cool but it's like but not cool at the

530
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,760
time okay I mean it wasn't until I stole

531
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,169
a lady's badge off her desk that I was

532
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,750
able to get access into the rest of the

533
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:02,110
area but it took it took a time okay it

534
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,780
took some time okay so you have to that

535
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,159
helps it's like you have people that are

536
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,070
having problems locking their

537
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,170
workstation it's like are you using a

538
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,730
different multi-factor authentication

539
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,280
for some of the apps that they have

540
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,010
access to it's like why are you letting

541
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,899
you just be wide open it's like so have

542
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,210
multi-factor authentication awesome

543
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,730
reraises like have they have to be in

544
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,320
banks they have a USB token or they have

545
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,570
a key fob or they have something to show

546
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,850
they just can't let the stuff go through

547
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,710
I mean yes most of the times you see the

548
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,449
USB key right next to the laptop and

549
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,000
that makes you cry and that's why we

550
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,710
drink but still it's like it's something

551
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,430
it's still something that you can use

552
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,680
and something that can help the other

553
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:48,100
thing is not following established

554
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:51,670
procedures that has gotten me into more

555
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,020
places and helped me you know get data

556
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,000
than

557
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,950
not pharmacy established procedures are

558
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,110
saying if you see this person do this if

559
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,690
you have someone else for this do this

560
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,399
this is a great story to civility and

561
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,230
somehow breached an Air Force Base and

562
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,960
were found only with one of them told

563
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,610
the airman she'd been kidnapped in Las

564
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,120
Vegas this was just like last year I

565
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:16,149
believe it's like literally they drove

566
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,409
on to the airbase the guy I mean we're

567
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,760
not saying this guy is a Nobel Prize

568
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,559
winner or anything or like you know in

569
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,510
the thinking department but still it's

570
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,920
like drove onto an Air Force Base trying

571
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,260
to escape whatever he was trying to

572
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,270
escape got onto the every word in him

573
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,429
got lost and was driving around and

574
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,460
finally the lady was able to separate

575
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:36,549
and tell some guards that she was

576
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,730
kidnapped and they were like how did you

577
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:42,340
get here you know it's like there was a

578
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:45,130
failing of procedure we can all agree on

579
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:48,159
that occurred at some point that allowed

580
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:52,059
that to happen during the Cold War a

581
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,770
Russian agent drove onto a base and

582
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:56,080
everyone the air force people in here

583
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,889
okay but come on it's like drove onto an

584
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:05,620
Everywhere's base in Germany he stole a

585
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:08,650
missile he put a tarp over it in a

586
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:12,969
wheelbarrow after he detached it from

587
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:15,100
the plane we related to his Mercedes we

588
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,100
are in Germany after all we'll barreled

589
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:21,340
it into his Mercedes stuck it in the

590
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,500
backseat put a red flag because that's

591
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,760
German traffic laws on the tip of the

592
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:31,660
missile sticking out drove it back to

593
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,559
his apartment and then disassembled it

594
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,270
and shipped all the pieces to Russia

595
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,530
through their mail system it's very

596
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,780
efficient I've heard so there you go I

597
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,970
will have to think we all should agree

598
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,330
some procedures were skipped in that

599
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:53,070
incident okay some people may have not

600
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:58,299
done proper procedures it's like

601
00:23:53,070 --> 00:24:01,570
procedures are not just a way to punish

602
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:04,480
your employees if you're using

603
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,429
procedures and policies as a punishments

604
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,430
tool your

605
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:11,880
doing it wrong your policies and

606
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:13,680
procedures are there to empower them to

607
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,440
shield them to make them feel

608
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,380
comfortable and saying I'm sorry we have

609
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,510
a procedure you can't do that that gives

610
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,700
them the shield to actually do the right

611
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,990
thing because they're not thinking about

612
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,670
getting caught and getting in trouble

613
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,590
they're thinking about proactively

614
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,880
no I don't have to blame it on me it's

615
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,399
not me stopping you

616
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,250
it's the procedure I'm sorry our process

617
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,020
is you can't come in unless you have

618
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,780
your own badge I can't open the door for

619
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,070
you and trust me I broken into places

620
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,720
and stuff you know in a wheelchair and

621
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,000
I've done that look and they still do it

622
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,590
and that's wrong don't look at me I'm

623
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,080
remember the kittens remember it's like

624
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm a bad guy I'm doing bad things so

625
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,460
it's like so you do that and you have

626
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,170
that procedure to rely on saying oh I

627
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,610
would like to let you in but we have the

628
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,260
process you know everybody here in the

629
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,879
South being offline I know sure it's

630
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,170
like you know I've broken into buildings

631
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,610
before it's like where I've seen the man

632
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,770
traps and all the security I just waited

633
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,139
to the back and I just waited to tie my

634
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,060
shoe and when the lady came by I opened

635
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,010
the door for like a gentleman it's like

636
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,370
I just walked in right behind her it's

637
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,650
like so I mean that that that works so

638
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,959
what's the whole point of all this

639
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,120
besides telling funny stories and trying

640
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,170
to amuse you

641
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,110
well Jason basically I thought we were

642
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,490
expecting so you know we're those so

643
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,120
hopefully I've accomplished that part

644
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,590
okay but now let's get to the other part

645
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,659

654
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,030
we got everybody talks about insider

655
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,920

657
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:00,840
doing something wrong it's like it's not

658
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:03,750
always malicious your insider threat is

659
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,290
always is never going to always be a

660
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,760
malicious attacker sometimes it's just

661
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,230
Suzy in the county who clicked on the

662

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,899
station and that's where they're getting

665
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,270
privileged escalation from because she

bag

668
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,960
it's like the the other example here

669
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,908
it's like we got the we all know about

670

674
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,950
story that was in the international

675
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:41,710
press what was the problem with that

676
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:45,129
story someone in TSA and their infinite

677
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:49,409
wisdom decided to leak all the pictures

678
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:54,158
of all the keys and their their filings

679
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:56,830
onto the internet how many people have a

680
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,190
copy of the 3d printer Johnny Xmas keys

681
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,168
that he 3d printed and created files for

682
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,580
okay good it's like why no you guys back

like so yeah so all those gives it and

685
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:11,200
when asked and tried to be held

686
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:14,559
accountable for the leaking of those

687
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,970
keys the government response was well

688
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,739
you can't really bet that much about

689
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,749
security it's just it's not that big of

690
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:21,489
a deal it's just the keys to the luggage

691
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:24,099
it's like it's just it's not really our

692
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:25,599
problem this is the same government

693
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:28,330
looking for the keys for your

694
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,489
cryptography on your phones if they

695
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,428
handle the keys like that that's why I

696
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:36,700
have a problem getting my my phone

697
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:39,399
crypto key okay it's like so you have to

698
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:44,249
worry about mistakes mistakes can be

699
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:47,379
just as damaging as a dedicated insider

700
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:52,840
also who in this picture who do you ask

701
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:57,039
for for identification every single one

702
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,830
of them I mean I will for extra credit I

703
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,570
will admit that the guy in the loire the

704
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,460
lower one it's like he's a security

705
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:08,769
officer it's like he's got an actual ID

706
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:10,840
badge but he still ask everybody it's

707
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:13,090
like you have to enforce that policy you

708
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,009
have to make sure people are adhering to

709
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:19,209
the background because how about one of

710
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:23,739
these people lost their job that day and

711
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:26,409
then try to come back visit the badges

712
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:28,989
have to be visible it's like I remember

713
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:30,609
being when I was way younger and more of

714
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:32,440
a jerk I know it was hard to believe but

715
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,210
I was but when I was more

716
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,630
jerk it's like that's one location I

717
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,640
noticed the CEO of the company didn't

718
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,470
have his badge on and our company policy

719
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,110
procedure said if you did not have your

720
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,390
badge with you that day you forgot it or

721
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,699
left it at home you had to go to the

722
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,580
receptions and get a visitor's badge and

723
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,820
wear that the whole day and I made the

724
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:58,240
CEO the owner of the company who pays my

725
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,639
paycheck go to the receptionist and get

726
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,200
a visitor's badge and wear that till his

727
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,580
assistant went to his house and picked

728
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,770
it up for him and brought it back but

729
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:09,220
still he went and got that he still got

730
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:12,070
that visitor's badge with me that wasn't

731
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,540
a good kudos on me you know I'm sort of

732
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:19,210
an a-hole it's like that wasn't on me

733
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:21,850
that was on him he lived by that policy

734
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,950
he showed every single employee in his

735
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,050
company that that procedure was

736
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:29,080
important that policy was important and

737
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,399
it had to be adhered to how many other

738
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,050
people in our company were gonna be able

739
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,540
to use the excuse when I forgot my badge

740
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,550
but it's not that big of a deal that the

741
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,950
CEO of the company is using a visitor's

742
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:41,919
badge that everybody's it easier if your

743
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,820
CEO uses this doesn't adhere to the

744
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,250
security policies everybody has to

745
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,990
that's why upper management buying

746
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,720
process into the process is so important

747
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,150
so I'm just about funding it's about the

748
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,770
culture that you're creating your

749
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,480
executives have to show that they live

750
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,170
by the same security procedures and

751
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,250
policies that everybody lives through

752
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,950
it's like an if you can't make it

753
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:08,200
suitable and you can't make it palatable

754
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,710
for the executives then how do you

755
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,850
expect the other employees to live by oh

756
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,950
you've got to dictate and you got to

757
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:19,629
make those policies for everybody not

758
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:21,160
for exclusions what about passwords

759
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,010
what are your employees think a password

760
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,930
manager is most thing gets underneath

761
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,360
the keyboard for some reason where did

762
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,910
that become a thing I've hardly ever

763
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,649
been in one company that I broke it into

764
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,260
that I have not been able to look up in

765
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,910
it under keyboard and see a password I

766
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,400
mean somewhere in the dawn of time

767
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,380
someone thought I need a secure place to

768
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,860
store this is my password so all my Big

769
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,810
O

770
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,520
under the keyboard no one's gonna look

771
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,899
there it's like the mat in front of the

772
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,940
door

773
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,310
right no one ever looks there is

774
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,630
everything like what's to bond say of

775
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,020
course all the movies are under the mat

776
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,220
no one's been looking at exactly

777
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,990
everybody's gonna think it's so obvious

778
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,970
they're never going to look there we

779
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,240
always look there that's why it's in the

780
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,470
movies okay so you got to understand

781
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,850
those things it's like you've got to

782
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:08,970
make sure that's like your people know

783
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,530
how to do proper password policies it's

784
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,810
like how many people in your company

785
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:16,649
know that this base bar is a valid login

786
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:19,230
character for your Windows Network this

787
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,770
base mark there's one of the most

788
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:25,290
important keys on that keyboard because

789
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,760
why because who has effing time to

790
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:29,250
remember upper lower case special

791
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,650
character my astrological sign it's like

792
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,920
in DNA sample no that that's not a good

793
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:36,390
password you know why because that means

794
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,180
people write them down because it's too

795
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,980
complicated and I put it under their

796
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,350
keyboard see the vicious circle that we

797
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,480
just went to is like horrible right so

798
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,639
what we need to do is actually

799
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,190
understand that we need to show them how

800
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,930
to make better passwords and use

801
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,270
password managers show them the

802
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,550
alternatives not just eight characters

803
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:59,370
special characters and numbers it's like

804
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,960
one of the things we need to do is we

805
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,360
need to get to the point where they

806
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,280
understand what pass phrases are tell

807
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:11,250
them to write down their favorite movie

808
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:15,060
quote or music lyric and type that all

809
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:17,880
out with proper grammar with proper you

810
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:20,700
know and maybe shifting one vowel to a

811
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,290
number and then instead of having an

812
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,810
eight character special upper lower case

813
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:27,210
password they have a thirty character

814
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:30,000
pass phrase that is easier for them to

815
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,500
remember and they could write out

816
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,180
fluidly because they're using the

817
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,230
spacebar they're using the actual typing

818
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:38,370
method it's like that's more natural

819
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,950
that's what we got to get our users

820
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,219
going to getting them to do it more

821
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:46,260
naturally so they keep doing it we keep

822
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,380
making our policies and procedures so

823
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,720
unnatural and counterintuitive to the

824
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,670
rest of their business process and then

825
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,940
we have this old shocked face when they

826
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,380
when the breach happens it's like we're

827
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,000
all like surprised that they didn't

828
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,990
follow the process

829
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
like what do you mean you didn't turn

830
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,870
three degrees counterclockwise and turn

831
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,100
to the left and make sure no one was

832
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:09,330
looking seven when you entered

833
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,919
why did you not do that that's easy so

834
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,620
you have to give them that you have to

835
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,610
educate them on those things how many

836
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:20,939
people here have stalked your co-workers

837
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:22,889
on social media now how many people done

838
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,880
it for business look at all those hands

839
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,340
go down sorry I should have said that

840
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,920
first part it's like first no no it's

841
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,199
like for a business you should be

842
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,690
stalking not stalking that's a bad word

843
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:39,510
it's like you should be searching for

844
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:40,980
your presence on social medias I mean if

845
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,420
you want to get really depressed and

846
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,080
stuff you know to help with your your

847
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:50,280
your future drinking tonight go type in

848
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:54,389
hashtag new badge or hashtag new job on

849
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,950
Instagram it's a little sad I mean if

850
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,130
you're a defender if you're a tacher

851
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:02,880
it's like payday it's like these are all

852
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:05,850
these templates so it's like check those

853
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,220
things look on such a we log out of your

854
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,370
accounts use the different browser even

855
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:13,889
and look at your social media presence

856
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,719
of your company searching by your

857
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,569
company's name on LinkedIn on Twitter

858
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,129
it's like on Facebook seeing what the

859
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,870
comments are seeing what the people are

860
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,330
writing seeing what their privacy

861
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,250
settings are I was doing one I was doing

862
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:29,810
a social profile media profile on a bank

863
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:32,969
and literally one of the bank employees

864
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,350
had on their public profile to this show

865
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,669
just like do you want to add this person

866
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,110
as a friend I'm like they're never gonna

867
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,990
add me as a friend after this it's like

868
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:43,460
but I was not a friend with them and it

869
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:47,699
had her address and her phone number

870
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,350
public privacy settings weren't the

871
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:51,179
greatest I mean they were perfect for

872
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,909
Facebook but before you know normal

873
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,020
people wasn't the best it's like and

874
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:58,109
then you know what I did what you know

875
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,320
what the next slide was right a picture

876
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:03,060
of her house I'm not that creepy I got

877
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,520
it from Google Streetview okay stop stop

878
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,190
judging what it looks okay it's like

879
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,840
it's like but I had that picture there's

880
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,000
still bank employees getting kidnapped

881
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,560
and held overnight so they can open up

882
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,860
the next day

883
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,080
still and this person is that vulnerable

884
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,060
but they didn't realize the threat they

885
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,230
didn't realize Facebook equates to real

886
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,580
life they don't realize their social

887
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,960
online presence can do kinetic damage

888
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,420
they didn't realize that they didn't

889
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,970
correlate those two that's part of your

890
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,610
job to let them know and let them

891
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,290
understand that so you have to let them

892
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,570
know that you're what they post online

893
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,070
can affect them one of the best beer

894
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,590
fishes I've ever done was - the guy who

895
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:45,300
hired me the CEO of the company it's

896
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,470
like was long story but like and I used

897
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,810
and I started off with his twitter

898
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,370
account because he told me what

899
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,720
conference he went to and I was able to

900
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,450
correlate and then person take one of

901
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,000
the speakers from there it's like that

902
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,439
but it was that simple

903
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,790
so you have to let them know to be

904
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,190
careful out of how they post things and

905
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:05,480
what they're posting because phishing is

906
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:08,850
still the leading cause of compromise

907
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,490
but your employees really care do they

908
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:16,529
really equate that with a compromise if

909
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:18,569
your employee clicks on a link or goes

910
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:23,130
to website and compromises the machine

911
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:29,220
or download the virus what happens to

912
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:32,369
them exactly why aren't they being

913
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:36,569
punished if you have a delivery driver

914
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:38,570
and his job is to do deliveries and he

915
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:41,359
gets in a car wreck with that vehicle

916
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:45,180
does he get away scot-free

917
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,790
there's a talking right by the third

918
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,220
time

919
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:53,380
racks or totals of an is he still your

920
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:55,299
employee probably not so why aren't we

921
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,490
holding to the employees that are doing

922
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,880
the damage electronically to the same

923
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:02,819
standards it's like the delivery driver

924
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,380
lost you 100 grand

925
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:10,450
your other employee lost you 100 million

926
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,090
if they don't start realizing there are

927
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,350
real-world risk to their job and the

928
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,690
ability to feed and clothe their

929
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:19,480
children they are not going to take it

930
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:22,240
seriously the first time a user clicks

931
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,950
on a link it's like they should have

932
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,689
they should be counseled they should go

933
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,960
back to reiation to security awareness

934
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,000
training the second time this should go

935
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,160
in their file and they should be

936
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,870
counseled again and they should be on

937
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,910
some kind of restrictive access through

938
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:39,700
the network on what they have access to

939
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:42,370
and the third time an employee clicks on

940
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,319
a link to a phishing email that could

941
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:48,040
potentially jeopardize your company

942
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:52,780
they're terminated and guess what

943
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,460
happens in then it becomes real oh I've

944
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,660
got real now right he's like look how

945
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,420
quiet everybody is that could anybody

946
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,520
like it crap I've done so many leaks you

947
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,160
know say it makes you think a little bit

948
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,080
different about it but that's what they

949
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,089
need to understand that there are

950
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,940
real-world consequences to what they do

951
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:11,550
online to that computer

952
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:15,280
everybody's guarding the all the tellers

953
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:17,350
at the bank if a guy comes in with this

954
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,870
key masking shotgun they're doing

955
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:22,299
everything correct they know exactly how

956
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,770
to judge his height it's like by the way

957
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,030
the door is it's like they know what the

958
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,710
height is because they use their little

959
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,150
measuring things they know how to comply

960
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,350
they know how to like talk you know how

961
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,120
to be the side on alarm without getting

962
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:34,540
detected they know how to do all those

963
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:36,910
things like clockwork because they are

964
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,850
trained and expected and are told uphold

965
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:43,080
to those things but a guy dressed like

966
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:46,420
me or in a suit with a USB Drive whoa

967
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:49,480
come on I've literally robbed a bank

968
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,130
once with a Bluetooth one of these work

969
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,930
search that said Def Con on it it was

970
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,200
blue and a black letter said Def Con

971
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,640
with a fake name that I had no ID and I

972
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,279
have a lot of fake IDs but I didn't even

973
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,589
have one

974
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,600
name that I came up with with a fake

975
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,220
company that didn't exist and a number

976
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,580
Lord knows where it went but it was the

977
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,350
same area code and all I did was login

978
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,730
to the vendor area the vendor list

979
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,250
showing that I was visiting the site I

980
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,360
was there for elections because there

981
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,710
was brownouts from the main headquarters

982
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,070
and I had to check to make sure all the

983
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:21,230
UPS's and APCs are connected properly

984
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,640
and all the machines are getting backup

985
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,280
power in case something goes wrong at

986
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,319
the teller machine they walked me

987
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,940
through the whole bank through the

988
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,700
drive-through area through the back

989
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,440
office not the big shiny vault you know

990
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,819
that's for show but they showed me like

991
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,670
the big firing cabinet all the money is

992
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,830
like I put a drop box behind the bank

993
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,180
managers desk I mean I didn't have to

994
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,710
but once again I'm a jerk sometimes and

995
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,299
I thought it was funny to compromise the

996
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,490
bank manager so it's like I put it

997
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,010
behind there so instead of walking away

998
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:52,069
with a couple of thousand I'm walking

999
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:54,200
away with a couple of million and am

1000
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,310
less likely to get shot and if I get

1001
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,290
caught it's white-collar crime so you

1002
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,000
know the really cool prisons right it's

1003
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,800
like if they got kick makes me oh it's

1004
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,150
like you know I can't miss it last

1005
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,830
season of Game of Thrones right that'd

1006
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,040
be horrible so it's like so that's the

1007
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,870
good thing so it's like we have to show

1008
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,970
our employees to be aware of these kind

1009
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:13,130
of threats and they need to understand

1010
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:15,919
that they are responsible for these

1011
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,690
threats and we need to train them the

1012
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,350
tellers are trained on what to do for

1013
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,640
the attack so do your accounting people

1014
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,549
and what makes you so you have to help

1015
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,410
you justify your budget and your actions

1016
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:29,030
how many people here have reports that

1017
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:31,700
they give to their upper management

1018
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:35,960
about how many firewall hits they get

1019
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,919
that are potential attacks or our IDs

1020
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,890
alerts

1021
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,140
how many clydie lesser alerts go off or

1022
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,460
how much spam email or how much possible

1023
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,330
malicious email comes through the

1024
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:49,490
Gateway everyone should have that

1025
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:51,980
because that is hardcore numbers and

1026
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,229
metrics that when you go the next year

1027
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,720
to your company and you go to your

1028
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,720
manager you say hey she knows how

1029
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,029
nothing really happened this year you're

1030
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,040
welcome we did our good job we didn't

1031
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,620
see nothing if you can give us two

1032
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,690
million dollars more we'll make sure

1033
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,750
nothing happens next year that you can

1034
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,330
see

1035
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,950
you'll see no discernible change except

1036
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,848
for a two million dollar decrease in

1037
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,180
your annual budget

1038
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:19,619
it's like isn't that great why are you

1039
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,980
walking out of the room now

1040
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:27,630
you know it's like that's the problem if

1041
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:30,090
we do our job they see less you have to

1042
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,010
find ways to make them see more give

1043
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,490
them numbers give them metrics give them

1044
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,500
pie

1045
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,500
everybody loves pie pie charts it's like

1046
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,090
give them those kind of metrics to go by

1047
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,550
show them those things let them

1048
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:43,950
understand that it's like and then it's

1049
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,390
a lot easier to get that budget for your

1050
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,740
blinky boxes but you should be spending

1051
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,618
some of that on you know security

1052
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,470
education for your employees as well

1053
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:54,900
because educated and empowered users can

1054
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,459
you ever have enough it's like ASAP

1055
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,430
notice a consistent theme in the last

1056
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,540
decade of your talks really is it really

1057
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,520
because that's what I've been trying to

1058
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,960
do I hope that's like you know I'm one

1059

boxes help your procedures and policies

1067
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:23,130

1068
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,660
Bob and accounting just clicking

1069
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,580
willy-nilly on anything because he

1070
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:36,080
doesn't really care you still have a

1071
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:36,080
problem that needs to be fixed so oh

1072
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:53,859
we're actually opting not opting for the

1073
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:55,479
the silence okay yes well they can go

1074

1078
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,549
security awareness training classes you

1079
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:05,348
can create your own internal security

1080
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:08,440
awareness team one of the things you can

1081
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,999
do is gamify because you know why people

1082
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,459
don't like your data they don't care

1083
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:14,709
about your data your users don't care

1084
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:16,989
about your data so you're not going to

those things show them how to be more

1111
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,718
security conscious about Craigslist fast

1112

they still don't care about your data

1117
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,719
but they're more security conscious at

1118
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:33,669
home they'll take that to work and

1119
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,900
everybody wants to win and if it's going

1120
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,309
to be just like reporting a suspicious

1121

1129
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,210
co-workers machine was already

1130
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,009
compromised they had already gotten in

1131
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,770
the attackers are trying to a privilege

1132
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,119
escalation into the company and we're

1133
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,829
sending out these emails to get someone

1134
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:11,760
to click on it so they could infect more

1135
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:15,650
machines and try to go elsewhere when

1136
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,570
they asked the lady why she reported it

1137
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:20,790
she was honest

1138
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,950
well it looks sorta suspicious I mean

1139
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:24,900
not that suspicious okay I wanted to get

1140
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,460
another entry and it didn't seem right

1141
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,810
so I thought if I sent it I could still

1142
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,810
get another entry into the drawing that

1143
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:36,540
was it she did not feel threatened she

1144
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,730
did not feel that it was a security

1145
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,670
breach she does not feel like her

1146
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,750
employee her co-worker was compromised

1147
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,390
but you know thousand dollars a thousand

1148
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,849
dollars people you know it's like and

1149
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,900
that's why it worked

1150
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:50,609
she got a prize by the way it's like

1151
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,930
they keep her special price that she did

1152
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:54,540
save them like several millions of

1153
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:57,690
dollars I'm sure it's like so you get a

1154
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:04,020
prize for that so that's how that works

1155
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:06,030
any other questions yes if it's free

1156
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,470
it's like personal use it's like you

1157
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,050
know it's like there's lots of like you

1158
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:12,569
know you got ArcSight for for corporate

1159
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:15,420
it's like that last pass for top of my

1160
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:17,490
head there's anyone I'm not gonna say

1161
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,020
use it usual and yes there's been

1162
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,549
vulnerabilities it's like you know

1163
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,109
saying oh yeah there's been a

1164
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,280
vulnerability they fixed it and they

1165
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:24,598
found it and they're still using

1166
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,819
everything's gonna have vulnerabilities

1167
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,140
it's like saying that like hold what

1168
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:30,029
y'all know if you should use a pass a

1169
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,490
password manager because it's like it's

1170
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,349
been compromised like okay so taping it

1171
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:36,509
onto your monitors is better right it's

1172
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:38,460
like no it's like it's it's mitigating

1173
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,310
risk we are never going to eliminate

1174
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,319
risk your job is never to eliminate risk

1175
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,599
your job is to mitigate as much risk as

1176
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,920
you can offset what you can't and then

1177
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,450
tell the executives what they have to

1178
00:46:46,920 --> 00:47:00,740
accept and then make them make the

1179
00:46:48,450 --> 00:47:04,109
decisions yes it mostly comes with just

1180
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:07,709
the key and the keypad it's like so the

1181
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:09,540
badge and key you know you do the proxy

1182
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,940
card with the keypad and it's like and

1183
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:14,220
you do and no one has the budget for the

1184
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,339
multi carat but what you do do is you

1185
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,379
change out the keys it's like every

1186
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:21,299
quarter or something it's like you don't

1187
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:27,230
know how many buildings I've gotten in

1188
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:32,069
because let's see one nine seven and

1189
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:33,030
three all the ink has gone all the other

1190
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:36,060
keys are pristine

1191
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:37,970
I wonder what four digits I need to know

1192
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,940
to break into this place

1193
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:45,980
so we went down from all these numerous

1194
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:49,170
times digits to 21 different guesses and

1195
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:51,329
21 guesses truck I have time for 21

1196
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,970
guesses people okay it's like I'm

1197
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:54,960
getting in it's like so I see that in so

1198
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,450
many different times in so many

1199
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,210
different places in secured areas it's

1200
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:03,000
like those worn off keys so it's like so

1201
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:05,190
just make sure that it's a keypad and up

1202
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,260
and a card and also make sure you have

1203
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,369
someone monitoring it one of the one of

1204
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,950
the places that I see it's like anytime

1205
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:14,010
you badge in there is an actual human

1206
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:16,500
being looking at you and then looking at

1207
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,970
the picture on their screen and it's not

1208
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,380
a little B Square picture it's like it's

1209
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,750
actually a bigger so I figure where they

1210
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,150
can say okay that's that's person that's

1211
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,250
person okay they match it's like cuz

1212
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:29,060
trust me it's like when you go in and

1213
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:33,480
I'm cloning you know the receptionist or

1214
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:35,790
the CFO or the CEOs card and they happen

1215
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,250
to be female it's like I walk in someone

1216
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:41,069
should notice something you know there

1217
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,930
should be like she's Susie's looking a

1218
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:45,119
little different today it's like you

1219
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,980
know it's like I've never seen her in

1220
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,050
those jeans and t-shirt before it's like

1221
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,520
maybe I should do something about that

1222
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:59,060
so there you go

1223
00:48:50,520 --> 00:49:01,020
so that's what you do yes there's what

1224
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:03,720
any loss

1225
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:06,270
if anybody gets fired there's always

1226
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,560
lawsuits this is America I mean it's one

1227
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:11,369
of our founding principles right it's

1228
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,660
like I'm pretty sure it's like no no but

1229
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:15,630
it's like it doesn't matter it's

1230
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,520
established policies and there's there's

1231
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,800
people getting upset if they get fired

1232
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,300
for going to pornographic sites you

1233
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,820
don't allow them to do that they get

1234
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,140
fired if they do that it's like we're

1235
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,580
holding them up to the same standards of

1236
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,890
the security you do not let employees

1237
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,330
and we did this one this is one thing

1238
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,730
that I've done at the old bank that I

1239
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,529
used to work at we had a policy it's

1240
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,750
like where you cannot leave your laptop

1241
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,540
unsecured when you take it out of the

1242
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:43,140
building people were losing laptops all

1243
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,869
the time you know what we did we

1244
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:49,650
instituted a policy that anybody that

1245
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:54,060
loses a laptop has to pay the company

1246
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:56,070
over $200 to replace a laptop to

1247
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,799
revision it to do the time and do the

1248
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:01,619
effort to get they had to pay $200 out

1249
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,250
of their paycheck for every time that

1250
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:09,109
happens guess how quickly and

1251
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:11,520
dramatically the lost laptops dropped

1252
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:14,730
because now they realize oh I'm now

1253
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,380
beholding to something if you don't want

1254
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,940
them stealing a chunk of metal that I'm

1255
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,670
sure you have encrypted and they can't

1256
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,109
get any data off of right it's like then

1257
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,300
why are we not getting upset when you're

1258
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:26,400
exposing the actual unencrypted data on

1259
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,859
their workship machines so that's it's

1260
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,020
just that simple they're doing damage to

1261
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:35,160
your company we're not acknowledging

1262
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:37,410
that fact security is not the janitorial

1263
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,029
services it's like we're not just there

1264
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,190
to clean up the mess after it happens

1265
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,090
we're there to prevent it it's like

1266
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,859
we're there to make sure that they

1267
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,780
understand the responsibilities for it

1268
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:47,460
so it's like they need to understand

1269
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,840
that as well we need to convey that to

1270
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:52,730
them and we're not doing a very good job

1271
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,730
at it yes

1272
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:20,640
yeah my thoughts on companies suing

1273
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:22,140
employees that have caused some

1274
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,240
ransomware ever I was like yeah it's

1275
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:26,250
like I'm sorry it's like if my delivery

1276
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,029
driver decides to you know take a little

1277
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,039
you know a little something-something

1278
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:30,359
before they go driving and then they

1279
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,130
drive and they hit like three or four

1280
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:34,650
cars are on their way down well guess

1281
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,960
what I'm gonna be sued my company's

1282
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:39,150
gonna be sued well I'm I'm passing

1283
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,740
though I'm sharing the joy I'm sharing

1284
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:42,210
that love it's like as soon as that

1285
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,368
happens I'm gonna be suing the employee

1286
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,470
because they're responsible for it

1287
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:48,990
what I that's the thing I don't

1288
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,819
understand and I've done this before

1289

1295
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,970

1296
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,380
love playing first-person shooters

1297
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,680
they're awesome

1298
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:11,869
you know and I'm the worst player you do

1299
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:16,169
not want me on your team cuz I'm like

1300
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:19,799
you know I'm gonna runnin and gunnin and

1301
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:25,279
you know what happens I die a lot but

1302
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:27,900
that's okay I'm like what respawn you

1303
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:30,720
know I got dirt some people I played

1304
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,220
with did have been like okay we got a

1305
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,689
situation here it's like I know this map

1306
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,848
it's like I'm gonna need three of us to

1307
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,259
go down here it's like we need to we

1308
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:38,519
need two snipers over on this side cuz

1309
00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:43,549
they usually come and I'm like Leroy

1310
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:48,209
Jenkins it's like and they're getting me

1311
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:53,660
now if you put electrodes on me and I

1312
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:53,660
got a shock for every time I got hit

1313
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:09,819
you know my posture would change once I

1314
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,329
feel repercussions to my actions they

1315
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:14,710
change we're not allowing the workers to

1316
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:18,579
understand that there are repercussions

1317
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:20,890
for their actions that's all it's not a

1318
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:23,170
blinky box change it's a mindset change

1319
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:25,420
which is ten thousand times harder to do

1320
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:31,480
but has to be done and we have to have

1321
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:32,650
conversations about it yes I was joking

1322
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,420
about the PV thing come on there's

1323
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:36,519
there's beds in here okay I'll

1324
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:47,799
I was not encouraging or talking about

1325
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:49,750
you know k4 active shooters I've not

1326
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:50,529
seen people talk about it it's like one

1327
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:54,039
of the things that I've talked about

1328
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:56,259
from a threat perspective is how do you

1329
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,869
alert the users it's like that there's a

1330
00:53:56,259 --> 00:54:00,640
risk going on I've always said if you

1331
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:02,950
see something suspicious or someone's

1332
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,089
coming in it's like you do a general

1333
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:09,160
announcement saying you know we need a

1334
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:11,589
mr. periwinkle to the front office you

1335
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:14,170
know very well to the to the factory

1336
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:15,190
floor it's like I mean or you know it

1337
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,630
does have to be periwinkle that may be

1338
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,289
obvious okay but I like saying field

1339
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,329
periwinkle

1340
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:21,279
I just like saying periwinkle but still

1341
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:23,650
it's like you have that code it's like

1342
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:25,420
you let people know when someone asks

1343
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:28,059
for that person's name there's something

1344
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:30,400
going on huddle in place have escape

1345
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:31,960
paths but I mean I don't really know

1346
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,490
what the answer is to active shooters

1347
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,170
because obviously it's not about taking

1348
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:37,990
care of guns it's like that's don't give

1349
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:39,519
me political it's like I'm really this

1350
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:41,109
is a bad time to ask me that because

1351
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,180
I've literally last week was having to

1352
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:44,920
go on to a website to look for a

1353
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,970
bulletproof hoodie for my 13 year old

1354
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,500
daughter because she's starting high

1355
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:49,930
school and that's what we do now in this

1356
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:53,049
country is uh when we get our children

1357
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:54,669
ready to go to school so yeah I don't

1358
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:57,339
know a great answer for active shooting

1359
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,960
it's like you tried to you know make

1360
00:54:57,339 --> 00:55:00,009
sure people are aware of it

1361
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,329
that's one of the best things and you

1362
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:03,490
make sure that there's a skate class and

1363
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:06,609
you know bulletproof you know backing on

1364
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:07,508
the desk wouldn't hurt but I mean yeah I

1365
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:10,140
don't have anything else worry on that

1366
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:12,799
one huh

1367
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:15,029
run hide fight yeah it's like yeah duh

1368
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,619
everybody should know exactly what they

1369
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:17,789
can do to get out it's a I mean I

1370
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:19,319
literally I was having the dog that's

1371
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:21,269
especially my daughter and I was telling

1372
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:22,920
her it's like you know we have a

1373
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:24,629
tendency in our family to be like the

1374
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,069
hero complex a little go do stuff we go

1375
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:28,920
to make things better it's like that's

1376
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:31,200
what you run okay you are not a hero you

1377
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,660
run it's like you get out of there and

1378
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,700
she told me her escape plans and in two

1379
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,319
of her classes she admitted that's like

1380
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,269
yeah I don't really I'm screwed on these

1381
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:41,279
two classes so basically my daughter

1382
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:43,019
admitted in two classes she will die

1383
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:45,180
it's like if it occurs during that time

1384
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:49,288
period thirteen years old that's what

1385
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:51,149
she that's her reality so wow thanks for

1386
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:53,609
killing the mood I had everybody with

1387
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:56,400
the pew pew all happy we're gonna do

1388
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:58,410
good then you I'm an okay

1389
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,519
there better be another question we need

1390
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:03,029
another question on this one

1391
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:06,558
okay I'm gonna pay someone 20 bucks to

1392
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:06,559
come up with another quote thank you yes

1393
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:17,390
like you have to ask now another one yes

1394
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:34,349
no that would be nice to have one of the

1395
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,180
things that we also like to test we

1396
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:38,430
deliberately like to suck at in our

1397
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:40,799
industry is sharing successes and

1398
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,788
sharing failures it's like because we

1399
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,049
don't want anybody else to know because

1400
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:44,789
competitively say well we don't want

1401
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:46,859
them to know what we're doing good they

1402
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:48,509
may do that or they may counter it it's

1403
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:51,119
like so we really are bad about sharing

1404
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:53,190
that kind of data so it's I don't have

1405
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,140
anything good off on you and I think I'm

1406
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,630
actually done now or got two more

1407
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,890
minutes but I got two minutes well no

1408
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:01,190
I'm not actually am done okay okay

1409
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:07,460
thanks guys I appreciate it

1410
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:07,460
[Applause]
