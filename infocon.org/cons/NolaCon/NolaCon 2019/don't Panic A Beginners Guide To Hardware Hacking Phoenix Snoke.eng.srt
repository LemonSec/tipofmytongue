1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
you can't hear me be sure to a gesture

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,609
or yell or something so I can make sure

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,720
to try speak louder obviously it's not

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,500
gonna really help if you can't actually

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,129
hear what I'm saying well good morning

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,769
everybody

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,480
hope you're not too hungover my name is

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,949
Phoenix Snoke and the talk that I'm

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,410
doing today is called don't panic it's a

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,150
beginner's guide to hardware hacking the

11
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,410
way I tried to set this up is that if

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,640
you have very little to no experience

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,900
you should be able to follow the

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,080
instructions I'm providing and get a

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,519
result as a result of that I made it

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,889
very slide heavy so they're going to be

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,239
written parts there maybe you'd like

18
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,710
copy of the slides I'm gonna include my

19
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,169
contact info at the beginning and end of

20
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:42,239
this talk so that you can get them no

21
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,010
pressure Rob and anyhow I'm apparently

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,050
supposed to give a bio or talk about

23
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,780
myself so that you know who I am which

24
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,489
seems little narcissistic but uh I've

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,219
spoken here twice previously with my

26
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,370
lovely talented wife this is the first

27
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,460
time that I've spoken by myself so you

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,300
know be gentle anyhow we've also spoken

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,000
at derbycon

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,908
sky con and some few b-sides up and down

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,619
the countryside I've got a two-year-old

32
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,280
and I make questionable life choices

33
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,570
other than that I'm very very normal I'm

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,760
going to include my email on here I

35
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,139
don't really do social media so that's

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,700
just the easiest way to get a hold of me

37
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,740
if you have any questions or comments or

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,290
like one copy of the slides or anything

39
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,640
feel free send them to me again since I

40
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,110
have a two-year-old I don't always have

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,600
as much free time as I would like to

42
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,490
think I do but I do make a point of

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,679
checking things and if you know I'll

44
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:38,130
make a point of getting back to you so

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,630
here we go pop quiz based on stock

46
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,679
photos what is the appropriate way to

47
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,060
hold a soldering iron safely yes if this

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
is any sort of indication you should

49
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,399
never take any sort of safety guidance

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,570
based on stock photos I was kind of

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,180
surprised I couldn't find one of

52
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,758
somebody picking their nose with one but

53
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,469
yeah their safety stuff is apparently

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,140
not a consideration and fake fake

55
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,880
photography that is what it is there's

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,140
my contact information it's Phoenix and

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,869
insecure devices comm and so about how

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,038
this talk is organized first parts going

59
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,840
to be why you should think this is

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,420
interesting I'm gonna spoiler it so you

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,440
don't leave the room

62
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,140
hardware vulnerabilities are really

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,900
really cool the other thing about it is

64
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,069
that there aren't a lot of ways to

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,959
really mitigate against them in the

66
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,760
first place however if a device goes out

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
with hardware vulnerabilities that

68
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,310
vulnerability will be there for the

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,600
lifetime of the device they aren't going

70
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,340
to send a technician to your house with

71
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,030
a pair of scissors to cut off a uart

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,990
port or something like that it's there

73
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,880
additionally we're going to talk about J

74
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,290
UART which is going to be a majority of

75
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,510
this talk sent this geared towards a

76
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,880
beginner level we're going to talk about

77
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,700
J tag I'm gonna try to briefly touch

78
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,290
upon SPI and i2c if we have time both of

79
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,140
them are really outside the scope of

80
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,760
this SPI is really really cool but it's

81
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,988
not really anything I would consider a

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,429
basic or beginner level techniques and

83
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:01,650
ITC really doesn't have a lot of info

84
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,060
SEC specific uses although it's really

85
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,560
cool too but it's more like if you're

86
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,800
trying to make your own devices to do

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,570
things and I do have a video

88
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,000
demonstration of actually breaching a

89
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,220
device that I'm gonna do a show here I

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,870
apologize in advance I had to do it into

91
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,630
two parts because I'm not very good

92
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,769
about editing videos which is not what

93
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm talking about so I hope that's

94
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:28,049
alright so here's the AR T this device

95
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,390
was a baby monitor that we used for IOT

96
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,799
testing years ago reason I included it

97
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,809
is because it's a nice large beautiful

98
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,760
picture and because the helpful Factory

99
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,030
in China silk-screened the port which

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,690
made it very easy to locate

101
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,519
additionally there's some visual

102
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,530
indicators to tell me kind of which pin

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,650
is which I've got a better picture that

104
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm gonna use it a little bit there but

105
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,470
we're going to just tell you you know

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,140
tell you what they are and how we mess

107
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,430
with this first thing about UART is it's

108
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,859
not a protocol so people will confuse

109
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,640
this one a lot of people will call them

110
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,170
either rs-232 S or rs-422 S 232 s are

111
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,040
your old serial ports that I'm sure

112
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,390
you're all familiar with they're not

113
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,600
really wrong per se but they're not

114
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,268
really right either a UART is simply a

115
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,600
physical circuit it's only there to get

116
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,640
information from point A to point B

117
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,839
there can be it but like in terms of the

118
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,488
people are calling them that it would be

119
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,010
like calling any sort of copper cabling

120
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,900
in a Comcast modem there is a copper

121
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,659
wire component of it however that is not

122
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,169
the device in and of itself

123
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,360
there's going to be three to six pins

124
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,460
usually we're going to only need three

125
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,350
the rest of it we can ignore now on

126
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,570
these security is not any sort of

127
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,570
consideration and this is the part where

128
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,599
we're all supposed to act surprised but

129
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,650
if you look at any sort of industries

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,210
writings about this about securing them

131
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,739
they'll actually be talking about

132
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,659
securing it so that they make sure the

133
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,010
signal goes from point A to point B so

134
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,330
you actually if you look at any industry

135
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,070
stuff about securing it

136
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,140
they'll they're talking about changing

137
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,590
baud rates or turning parity on on or

138
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,539
off

139
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,190
they there's nothing about actually

140
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,340
securing the signal it's just from

141
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,930
getting it where it's supposed to go the

142
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,460
other thing about this that I really

143
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,310
like to emphasize is that when you

144
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,710
locate the power or VCC pretend it is a

145
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,030
dangerous snake and you know how we'll

146
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,070
say that you should be you know it's

147
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,380
afraid of you as you are a bit know you

148
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,670
should be more afraid of this I don't

149
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,990
want you to break anything or you know

150
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,320
shock yourself and get it send me hate

151
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,090
mail so the part we care about is how do

152
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,130
we break it what we're going to want to

153
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,320
do is we're going to want to connect

154
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,080
these pins to a device that was a USB to

155
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,300
TTL cable there are a variety of flavors

156
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,870
of these I would recommend against

157
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,600
getting a PL 2303 the company itself

158
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,130
please don't sue me they seem like they

159
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,840
do a fine enough job but there are a lot

160
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,880
of counterfeit versions of this device

161
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,409
on the market and so you could buy one

162
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,390
and it just wouldn't work out of the box

163
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,460
for something that you're just starting

164
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,430
out on you wouldn't necessarily know the

165
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,229
tool wasn't working additionally in

166
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,880
order to try to make this accessible I

167
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,130
was trying to come up with the lowest

168
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,390
cost way to do everything and telling

169
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,540
you to buy something doesn't work really

170
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,099
kind of goes against that purpose the

171
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,050
one I would recommend is some flavor of

172
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,600
FTDI that's the name of the company it's

173
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,880
future technology something but they

174
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,300
have a series of these they're 23 I'm

175
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,100
sorry

176
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,490
23 two blanks there's gonna have like a

177
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,830
RQ and s they have a six wire and four

178
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,210
wire versions the six wire versions can

179
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,979
do a few more things if your start

180
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,840
getting into our way knows the price of

181
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,950
them are about the same as the four wire

182
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,200
version so I would just recommend

183
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,240
getting that sense you even do more

184
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,340
things with the tool and it's the same

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,919
price additionally there's going to be a

186
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,429
dip switch on them a lot of them will

187
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,200
have a different three or five

188
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,910
you're going to make sure you have it on

189
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,210
the correct voltage a lot of logic is

190
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,950
almost always going to be on 3.3 you can

191
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,340
in theory build your own with Arduino

192
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,450
most Arduinos are set at 5 volts though

193
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,359
so you might have to do some sort of

194
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:01,159
level shifting anyway it you can a lot

195
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,840
of this is trivial if you have access to

196
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,070
an oscilloscope or a logic probe you

197
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,530
really don't need to do any of this

198
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,120
however if you can read an oscilloscope

199
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,559
already you probably already know

200
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,280
everything they say in this talk because

201
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,120
you know how to do Hardware work

202
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,919
additionally you're just going to use a

203
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,170
multimeter that's what I use the tech

204
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,330
probes on these if you're going to ug

205
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,710
JTAG enumeration obviously gets a little

206
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,710
more advanced but we're just messing

207
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,440
with you arrow keys right now can you

208
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,080
all hear me okay I feel like I'm alright

209
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,820
awesome now there are visual indicators

210
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,609
that you can use to help narrow down

211
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,990
where you're looking grounds will

212
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,460
sometimes show if you shine a bright

213
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,290
light on Durham I'll show you in the

214
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,890
next picture but they're usually be a

215
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,360
pad that will basically be a cross on it

216
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,620
you can look for it like a large chunk

217
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,020
of solder or a metal pad that they'll

218
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,880
actually have under it additionally the

219
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,469
traces the lines that go out from the

220
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,140
ports the wide ones are going to be your

221
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,410
power the thinner ones are usually going

222
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,940
to be your transmit and receive have a

223
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,240
beautiful example here this is actually

224
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,950
the device I used for the video demo off

225
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,680
to the left there those are the JTAG

226
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,360
pins but the ones that we're concerned

227
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,800
about are on the right there I can tell

228
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,280
you from looking at them which ones are

229
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,720
which the two with the thin lines

230
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,929
they're off to the right

231
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,150
those are your transmit and receives the

232
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,920
one with the pad is the grep is going to

233
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:26,000
be your power here I'm going to stand in

234
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,710
front of this sorry I don't have a laser

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,320
pointer or anything that's going to be

236
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,789
your power there's the cross pattern I

237
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,939
was talking about that's your ground

238
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,690
there's your transmit and receive

239
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,039
visually you aren't going to be able to

240
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,840
tell your transmitted and receives a

241
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,159
part but that's not that big a deal in

242
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,280
the scheme of things we have other ways

243
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,750
to do that so in order to find the uart

244
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,459
port or to verify that you have found it

245
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,630
successfully you want to take your

246
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,930
multimeter and you want to change it to

247
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,390
your a continuity setting continuity is

248
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,540
going to be one of those two symbols

249
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,069
what

250
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,019
happen is when you successfully meet

251
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,160
make continuity the device will be if

252
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,829
you want to know what I'm talking about

253
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,399
you can take the probes and touch them

254
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:06,079
together it's the same thing this does

255
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,829
not work at the devices powered on at

256
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:11,000
all so what you're going to want to do

257
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,680
it doesn't matter what order you use the

258
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,730
probes on you're going to touch the

259
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,380
ground and then touch it to another

260
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,690
grounded point if there's an intent on

261
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,220
the device they usually attach a ground

262
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,440
to that but there's going to be like a

263
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,589
large a large piece of solder usually or

264
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,769
a pad of some sort again when you hit

265
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:32,029
the when you hear the beep you've won

266
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:34,310
now in terms of the power when you start

267
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:37,100
to device up and probe the pin it's

268
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,109
going to go to 3 3 5 volts whatever the

269
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,319
the power setting is and it's gonna stay

270
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,940
there once you've identified it again

271
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,469
you know remember the white races if

272
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,600
we're looking for it but once you've

273
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,709
identified it just just ignore it we

274
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,500
don't need a fright thing we're going to

275
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:54,018
do and it it is one of the few things

276
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,370
that can damage your equipment so that's

277
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,509
why I'm trying to you know stress that

278
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,279
this is something we just don't want to

279
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:02,389
mess with so for finding the transmit

280
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,540
during the boot sequence is the easiest

281
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,970
way to do that what you'll do is you'll

282
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,219
probe the pin it should start around the

283
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,740
same level as the device itself but

284
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,870
it'll drop off a little bit and it'll

285
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,199
remain very active it's going to go up

286
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,670
and down a lot you can look for the thin

287
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:25,160
traces to try to narrow down where

288
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:27,860
you're looking for the receive in a lot

289
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,410
of cases we can just simply say that's

290
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,510
the one that you know we've narrowed it

291
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,740
we've found all the others that's the

292
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,500
one that's left over you know

293
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,970
congratulations again you can look for

294
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,589
that thin trace if you're trying to

295
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,050
visually you know narrow down where to

296
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,760
search for usually though it'll start at

297
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,620
about the same voltage has the device

298
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,279
itself but then it'll drop dramatically

299
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,259
there are exceptions to this if you have

300
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,939
a device like a router or something like

301
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,699
that that is constantly trying to

302
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:57,139
receive it is going to be very very hard

303
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,969
to tell you're receiving your transmit

304
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,910
apart because they're both very active

305
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,430
and they're both high level the good

306
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,780
thing though is that you can guess you

307
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,459
can hook it up to your USB to TTL you

308
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,620
run everything you'll usually get a

309
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,120
result it'll be a bunch of a garbage

310
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,280
it's going to be just random ASCII

311
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,650
characters you can swap it out at that

312
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,000
point then it works correctly the but

313
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,949
it's not going to harm anything if you

314
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,220
Pro if you plug them in backwards it's

315
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:25,410
not going to harm anything the one thing

316
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,730
we really want to remember is that you

317
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,870
know you're transmitting your devices

318
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,990
your talk your receive as you're

319
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,310
listening the you have a transmit and

320
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,050
receive on your computer that you're

321
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,640
attaching this to you want to make sure

322
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,650
to reverse the lines you don't want to

323
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,400
attach talk to talk and listen to listen

324
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,870
they won't be able to communicate

325
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:45,300
correctly now there are some other UART

326
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,890
pens there's our CTS DTR they don't

327
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,620
factor into anything that we're gonna do

328
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,330
so we don't really care about them

329
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,070
additionally they're gonna depending

330
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,630
what how sincere your multimeter is

331
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,240
they're gonna probably read fairly close

332
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,680
to zero most of the time anyway so I

333
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,150
mean they'll they'll stand out as being

334
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,500
weird simply because there'll be a lack

335
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,780
of activity on them and they won't set

336
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,940
off any sort continuity but in general

337
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,819
most of the things I find are either

338
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,430
gonna have three or four pens

339
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,460
three will be the the bare minimums MIT

340
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:22,319
or receiving a ground but sometimes the

341
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:24,240
power ones there too so when you want to

342
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,500
use a terminal program I use many come

343
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
all the time because that's just what

344
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm used to be working with you can use

345
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,840
screen or other ones it doesn't really

346
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,170
matter you're going to want to set up

347
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,930
odd eleven five twenty is usually a good

348
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,849
first guess most devices then last

349
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,739
several years are set for that so I mean

350
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,210
it's it's extremely common so it's it's

351
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,140
not a bad guest because you're gonna be

352
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,820
out right more often than not

353
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,069
additionally you can write scripts there

354
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,090
if you do anything with like PI serial

355
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,100
or anything like that you can write

356
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,480
scripts to go through and check at each

357
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,570
level so you can see that you're

358
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,400
actually getting good information if

359
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,410
you're wrong a lot of times you'll get

360
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,970
it's just going to be random strings of

361
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,829
ASCII characters whereas once you

362
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,860
actually set it correctly you'll start

363
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,420
seeing you know press Enter you know

364
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,840
you'll you'll get text that's that's

365
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,160
human readable again we remember that we

366
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,450
want to put those wires in the correct

367
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,770
place that we're going to want to swap

368
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,850
you know transmit to receive and vice

369
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:22,500
versa now for troubleshooting

370
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,170
oh my goodness that's too small to

371
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,760
really say sorry if you get a lot of

372
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,219
output that it's going to be like a

373
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,069
diamond symbol with a inverse question

374
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,740
mark on it a lot of times that indicates

375
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:38,550
that the ground is not grounded that you

376
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,170
that you've soldered there so I would

377
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,729
double check that you can check the pin

378
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,219
the end of the pin that you've soldered

379
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,580
and check that for continuity it still

380
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,290
works

381
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,760
again you would want to make sure the

382
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,469
device is powered off same thing with

383
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,390
your transmits and receives maybe you

384
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,320
saw it or something

385
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,699
sometimes the pins are already attached

386
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,160
but you usually are gonna have to attach

387
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,270
them yourself but if you want to make

388
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,819
sure that the pins are done correctly

389
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,470
you can test the end of the pin that

390
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,380
works just like the just like the port

391
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,400
itself but I would check that I would

392
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,220
check through your transmit and receive

393
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,050
yeah swap them out see if that see if

394
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,110
that works then you can check your bod

395
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,939
rate very very rarely I've seen again

396
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,850
specifically with the question mark

397
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,500
error some devices will want you to

398
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,640
enable Hardware flow control which I

399
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,770
made a note of that because it's not

400
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,910
really that common in you don't mess

401
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,680
around with a lot of this you wouldn't

402
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,089
necessarily be able to figure it out it

403
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,300
and you know I don't want to frustrate

404
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:36,450
people so I'm going to show my demo

405
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:40,079
video here again I apologize for it you

406
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,880
should stop I apologize for it being a

407
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,050
little badly done but again I don't

408
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:49,880
really do videos I'm not John Waters but

409
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,880
this is me attaching the device itself I

410
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,260
[Music]

411
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,590
went ahead and I actually attached the

412
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,079
pins because I filmed it and it just

413
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,600
ended up being about two minutes of the

414
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,700
back of my hand I figured nobody wanted

415
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,110
to see that so there's our pins that

416
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,560
we've set I'm testing and with the

417
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,560
multimeter

418
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:25,860
you'll hear it beep here in a second as

419
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:33,810
you can tell I've said before continuity

420
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:35,100
there I'm checking the other ones for

421
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,229
continuity just for the sake and

422
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,089
completely completeness on this spoiler

423
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,440
alert they don't feet because they're

424
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:45,180
not the ground anyhow I'm thinkin oh

425
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,140
I'll plug in the device and show how I'm

426
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:52,560
trying to find the transmit and receive

427
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,149
the problem with this it's a router so

428
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,949
it's constantly trying to receive

429
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:57,540
information so I did end up happening a

430
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,589
guest for the transmit and receive on it

431
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,000
I happen to guess right on this I was

432
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,000
just going off the one that went lowest

433
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
but yes here check the ground to the

434
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,680
active cables when the device is powered

435
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:19,410
I had no idea that wouldn't actually

436
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:23,250
stop there sorry guys say three one the

437
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,689
device itself runs at three three so but

438
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,980
you got our you got your a boot sequence

439
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,149
where it's going up and down from where

440
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,589
it's transmitting information and that's

441
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,630
how we verified that you've done that

442
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,130
correctly you can just put pins on there

443
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,220
I usually like to run wires to it

444
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,470
because it just makes it easier now the

445
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,200
other video I have of this I did it's a

446
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,270
screen from inside Callie this is on the

447
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,180
other end once I did that I attached

448
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,910
those wires to a USB to TTL cable and

449
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:54,689
this is how you know the terminal work

450
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,920
on the other end because I think you'll

451
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:05,449
find this really interesting

452
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:09,619
oh that says Oh fine

453
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:11,419
I think about as big as I can make it if

454
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:13,309
you really want to see this I can send

455
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,539
you a copy of it just shoot me an email

456
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,459
but um

457
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,679
basically this is me going into mini-com

458
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:23,929
then plugging the device in so that it

459
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:26,240
powers up at this point it's going to

460
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:29,240
start going through the boot sequence we

461
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,470
have human readable information here or

462
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,760
it would be human readable if it was

463
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,720
large enough where you'd actually see it

464
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,269
I'm sorry but we're gonna let it do its

465
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,620
thing here sometimes you want to

466
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,549
interrupt them but for the first time I

467
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,330
would just let it run all the way

468
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:46,639
through you might be pleasantly

469
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:48,139
surprised what you end up getting you'll

470
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:49,969
also get information sometimes it'll

471
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,809
tell you information about like I in the

472
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,309
case we're out or sometimes they'll

473
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:56,809
actually get network information based

474
00:17:52,309 --> 00:18:01,190
on the boot up sequence hit enter to

475
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:05,120
continue okay I hit enter busy box which

476
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,799
is I busy box is a Linux package for

477
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,168
you'll see it a lot in IOT and embedded

478
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,168
devices if you look that I do echo user

479
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:14,389
I'm Roo I got shell on the device I

480
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:15,529
didn't do any any heart Ivy didn't do

481
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:16,370
any thought we're hacking whatsoever I

482
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,139
just went through the hardware

483
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,229
I now have complete control on the

484
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:22,760
device overall the process took me

485
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,789
including the soldering in about ten

486
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,049
minutes

487
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:30,289
that's why soldering and opening up the

488
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,139
case and taking it apart so you can see

489
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:36,950
why this is a really good thing to know

490
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:39,049
how to do the other thing I want to say

491
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,120
about this is if you want to if you want

492
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:45,730
to get a device just for the purposes of

493
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,320
messing with it I would go for a router

494
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,970
there is a very large community of

495
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,549
people that do custom firmwares on

496
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,919
routers so you can find a lot of

497
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,000
hardware information because of that the

498
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,850
thing is a lot of them are doing

499
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,409
over-the-air updates but there are

500
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,139
occasionally people that do JTAG stuff

501
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:05,179
for with them and so dependent what it

502
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:07,250
is if you're wanting again a JTAG depend

503
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,210
look up their forums of these and

504
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,799
they'll actually tell you we're all

505
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,299
dependent simon's are at everything you

506
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,158
don't have to actually do any work other

507
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,210
than confirming that what ran to people

508
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,549
on the internet it's telling you is

509
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,450
correct I mean I wouldn't just assume it

510
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:19,450
oh that doesn't say pal

511
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:25,759
on the Internet everybody's telling the

512
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:29,059
truth now about the rest of this here

513
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:37,340
we're going to go and touch up on JTAG

514
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:39,080
here now JTAG Mikey IRT is not a

515
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,359
protocol in and of itself is named after

516
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,549
a trade group called the joint test

517
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,418
action group they're not superheroes

518
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,529
they're not going to come to your house

519
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:46,989
and beat you up if you're doing bad

520
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:50,720
things

521
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:53,359
Jay tags are a lot more cool than UART s

522
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,249
however they are a lot more work and you

523
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,049
can't just use a multimeter to find the

524
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:59,570
appropriate ports you're gonna have to

525
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:01,429
actually use advice to do it they're

526
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,989
really really awesome things about Jay

527
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,029
tags is that you can do stuff like you

528
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:06,950
can write to the memory you can expect

529
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:10,279
the memory you can dump the info to ID

530
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,809
up I mean I'm sure you know you all are

531
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,820
starting to see where this has the you

532
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,580
know capabilities of doing some really

533
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,080
really awesome things additionally

534
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,789
though since you can do awesome things

535
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,289
you're going to want to be very careful

536
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,849
about what you do

537
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,320
surprisingly enough all these really

538
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:26,269
awesome security braking features

539
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,460
weren't meant to be there initially they

540
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:30,320
were stapled on after the fact because I

541
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,580
guess a vendor decided that they wanted

542
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,678
to have you know easily exploit a cross

543
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:43,399
cross-organizational remote

544
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:45,200
administration capabilities but you can

545
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:46,879
if you're going to want to do something

546
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,149
like dumper dumping firmware or

547
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:51,228
modifying firmware JTAG or SP eyes are

548
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:54,709
usually the way you're going to want to

549
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:57,019
go on that so how do we break it yes

550
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:00,950
unfortunately it's a bit more complex

551
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,450
than UART stuff I would recommend though

552
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,220
if you want to start out start out with

553
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,599
you a artis again like if you follow

554
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,789
those instructions you should be able to

555
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,658
get a result depending the device you

556
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:13,879
can get shell and get out you've won so

557
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:15,799
on this though you're going to FTDI or a

558
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:18,889
dongle program or jumper wires to

559
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,269
Raspberry Pi bus pirates would be that

560
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:21,889
what I would recommend if somebody said

561
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:23,720
hey I don't know what I need to get I

562
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:25,639
would say a bus pirate bus pirates new

563
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,519
communications with a lot of devices

564
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:30,979
they'll also do SPI and i2c if you start

565
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,309
messing with that there are expensive

566
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,600
tools

567
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,620
that will do things like dump firmware

568
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,969
significantly faster like shakarez and

569
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,018
some other specialized hardware they

570
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,610
start getting a lot more expensive

571
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,669
though bus pirates are usually around

572
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,649
like 35 bucks

573
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:47,899
now if the chips are not running at 3-3

574
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:50,989
you might have to do some level you know

575
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:52,459
some level shifting there the really

576
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,960
really awesome thing is if they have

577
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,820
both connectors like the picture I

578
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,669
showed you you can connect to both at

579
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,408
the same time and so if you're doing

580
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:02,470
something this is really useful because

581
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:05,419
a lot of devices if you're doing really

582
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:08,809
weird JTAG stuff you can set the devices

583
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:10,820
to you'll make the device reset if you

584
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:12,740
have a you are a plug-in and you can

585
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,480
watch the monitor and see what's going

586
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,340
on while you're doing doing the work in

587
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,659
real time so you can see if you're

588
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,789
tripping resets on the device or

589
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,139
anything like that

590
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:21,799
additionally since you can set

591
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,168
breakpoints

592
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,059
you can you know see what you're doing

593
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:29,749
it's it the you've got instant feedback

594
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:32,749
it's awesome in terms of identifying

595
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:36,259
which de-tag pin is which there are card

596
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:37,970
to like devices they're basically they

597
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,369
look look very similar to like some of

598
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,470
your raspberry pi type stuff but there's

599
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:45,619
a JTAG Noom which will go through an

600
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,539
arduino and then jtagulator again if

601
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:48,769
you're using an arduino to connect to

602
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,139
this stuff you want to make sure that

603
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,789
it's the same level as the device since

604
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:58,219
a lot of our tomatoes are 5 and a lot of

605
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:59,690
your logical circuits are 3-3 honestly

606
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,490
though the easiest way is in a lot of

607
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,019
cases you can find documentation if you

608
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,240
look around that will tell you what the

609
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:09,169
what the ports are unfortunately since

610
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,669
JTAG is not a standard i sometimes

611
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:13,610
there'll be 12 ports sometimes they'll

612
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:16,159
be 20 it's it's really random and it's

613
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,809
it's just different vendors do different

614
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,570
things different vendors do different

615
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,428
things based on the devices I was going

616
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,539
to do JTAG enumeration on that modem for

617
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:28,759
this just in case we had enough time but

618
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:30,559
the JTAG on that heart they actually

619
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,929
managed to mitigate hardware attacks on

620
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,619
the JTAG they did that by not including

621
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:39,320
any of the chips to make the JTAG work

622
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:40,970
which is a really weird design choice

623
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,408
based on that manufacturer i'm not

624
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,440
really sure why they put a port there in

625
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:47,040
the first place it's a dead port the

626
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,500
it should connect to is not on the board

627
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,530
if you surface-mount the appropriate

628
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,540
chips on there though it works so they

629
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,379
put a working channel but no actual

630
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,520
hardware for it to connect to which is

631
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,750
strange I don't know why they bothered

632
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,340
in the first place I'm assuming that

633
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,620
they must reuse the boards for like

634
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,760
maybe other other products and that they

635
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,739
the other products have the chips

636
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,120
because it just seems weird since it

637
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,310
would cost more to put a candle on there

638
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,030
and you know the channels it's not

639
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:18,909
connected to anywhere it's bizarre now

640
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,160
in SP eyes SP eyes can also do a lot of

641
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,110
really really awesome stuff it starts it

642
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,460
starts getting outside of the scope of

643
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,580
what you don't want to talk to you for

644
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,070
inter a talk you can use a bus pirate to

645
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,570
communicate with SP eyes additionally

646
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,570
instead of soldering they make a thing

647
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:36,040
called an SOI see pin it's a looks like

648
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:40,149
an alligator clamp and you basically

649
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,820
just stick it on the parts finding the

650
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:44,740
proper ports on SBI chips is really

651
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,780
really easy because if you look at the

652
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,220
chip there's usually the manufacturer

653
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,190
name and the number on it and then you

654
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,630
can look for datasheet like that so like

655
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,180
the router in question i use for the

656
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:57,100
demo this is the datasheet for that

657
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,960
there's going to be a dot on a lot of

658
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,090
them when it's just a chip you know tell

659
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,120
you which which ones pin one but it

660
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,429
tells us what all the pins are since

661
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,270
that's from the manufacturer itself it's

662
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:12,820
probably accurate but again it's also

663
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,050
showing they have a similar thing a JTAG

664
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,970
where it's not really a standardized

665
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:19,260
process so i mean has you could tell

666
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,260
those are all versions of the same chip

667
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,330
now i2c is the first thing out of all

668
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,629
this that actually is a honest good

669
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:32,290
protocol everything else is sort of a

670
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:34,180
de-facto one the cool thing about i2c is

671
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,580
that you have multiple devices speak on

672
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,340
the same bus and you can have multiple

673
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,320
identical devices speak on the same bus

674
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,070
this doesn't really have a lot of

675
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,419
security considerations the only that

676
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,490
can really think of is that you can

677
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:51,910
actually transmit through i2c like off

678
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,420
the board itself it's extremely slow

679
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,710
though and you can use bus pirates so

680
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,120
that to communicate with these they do

681
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,580
also make

682
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,520
usb2 I to see adapters so you can find

683
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,840
the port on the board and just solder an

684
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,580
adapter and then remove it when you're

685
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,439
done so anyhow I've gone 25 minutes

686
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,520
exactly here so I'm really glad that I

687
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,590
had time to share all this with you

688
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,940
here's my contact information again

689
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,740
unfortunately I don't really have any

690
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,790
time for questions but I'll hang out in

691
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,310
the hall for a few minutes if you have

692
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:24,250
anything you want to ask me and again I

693
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,540
do try to be Quito reachable so I really

694
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,280
appreciate everyone showing up this

695
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,730
morning I know it probably wasn't easy

696
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,280
based on last night so thank you very

697
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:38,380
much everybody

698
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,379
[Applause]
