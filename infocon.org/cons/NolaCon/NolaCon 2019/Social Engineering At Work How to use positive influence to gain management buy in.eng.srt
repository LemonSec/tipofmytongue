1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,390
hi thanks thanks for coming

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,780
freak she hit it so today we're going to

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:15,239
talk about social engineering at work

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:17,939
now I used to be like a debilitating in

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,279
a little feedback I used to have like

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,320
debilitating introversion like so bad

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,550
that I would take the stairs instead of

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,279
the elevator cuz I don't want to make

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,330
small talk with people it was really

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,929
really bad

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,360
I took a social engineering class at

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,600
blackhat and it completely changed my

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,370
life

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,190
like I actually learned how to talk to

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,320
people and that like I was the master of

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,440
my own destiny and some other stuff so I

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,149
can do it you you can do it even if

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,980
you're not an introvert this talk is for

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:53,760
you there are still tips in here that

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,649
are very useful so this is a since that

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,949
class I've traveled all over the world

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,480
and given talks and met people and made

23
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,769
small talk and done other kinds of

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,820
things that I love this I have to add

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,409
New Orleans on here now so one of the

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,408
things that we don't think about a lot

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,189
is that we can hack ourselves to make

28
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,330
our lives better and easier but we have

29
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,110
to practice it

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,119
so anything when I talk about here today

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,979
it's probably not going to come easy it

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,320
might be something that you're like this

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,140
sounds ridiculous but if you practice it

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,039
it will become more natural and easy to

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,220
do so before we get into influence and

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,549
some of those early things a lot of

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,798
people in InfoSec have impostor syndrome

38
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:44,430
it's that feeling where we're like man

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,530
if they've just found out that I have no

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,630
idea what I'm doing or like I have no

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,270
idea what I'm doing dog meme like that

42
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,860
it's that feeling like I don't know why

43
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,329
I'm here like I shouldn't have been

44
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,250
invited to this I shouldn't have been

45
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,229
hired but that kind of feeling so a lot

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,950
of us have that feeling but we need to

47
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,820
get over it

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,399
because we are better than that so

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,889
another problem that some of us have is

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,280
that people are scary they have their

51
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,050
own egos and their

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,980
it means we never know if they want

53
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,990
something from us that is something that

54
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:22,489
we necessarily want to give social

55
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,870
phobias small talk is icky and it can

56
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,620
feel kind of icky but we'll talk about

57
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,130
that too

58
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,930
some of us also have it just innate

59
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:34,549
reasons why we have difficulty relating

60
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:36,200
to other humans some of us have grown up

61
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,900
talking to people online and we're much

62
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,350
more comfortable with that but these

63
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:46,160
this is also part of why we're special

64
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:48,680
so we need to embrace this and and hack

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:54,500
ourselves so that we can hack other

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,959
people when we aren't sure what's going

67
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:01,430
on and we're not sure how to behave or

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,019
act we but the part of your brain that

69
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,200
feels physical pain is actually

70
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:07,819
activated so it's one of the reasons

71
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,030
that we avoid uncomfortable situations

72
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,380
and why when you're standing talking to

73
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,890
somebody and suddenly have nothing left

74
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,320
to talk about

75
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:18,679
it's like extremely uncomfortable this

76
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:25,100
is part of the reason why office

77
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,510
politics are terrible they they but we

78
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,209
but they do exist

79
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:34,070
we don't we can't ignore that there are

80
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,010
unwritten rules about how things are

81
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,230
done there may not be a policy about how

82
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,570
somebody gets promotion but we all know

83
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,910
that certain things happen and and

84
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,340
certain certain people have more

85
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,350
influence at work than others so if we

86
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,310
can play that game we can be more

87
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,930
effective and it can be fun actually so

88
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:59,060
every group has politics whether it's a

89
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:02,269
bake sale or a you know a boardroom

90
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,280
everybody has politics so I've got my

91
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,010
goal you've got your goal the developers

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,510
have their goals and we all bring that

93
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,570
to the table so there's gonna be some

94
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,429
strife there's gonna be a little bit of

95
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,510
disagreement we're always going to have

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,760
to compromise

97
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,190
bad politics are the reason that we hate

98
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,090
politics this is the backstabbing this

99
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:27,389
is the the people trying to get ahead

100
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,130
and stepping on other people's toes this

101
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,389
is what we're trying to avoid we're not

102
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,219
trying to be mean or evil or by any

103
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,530
means necessary what we're trying to do

104
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,720
with good politics so we want to advance

105
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,760
our own interests but we want to serve a

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,889
higher purpose we want to make sure that

107
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,479
the company is successful not just us we

108
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,000
want to make sure that our coworkers are

109
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,680
successful we want to make sure that

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,289
we're giving a recognition where it's

111
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,520
due and you know it would be nice to get

112
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:57,840
recognition for ourselves but the one

113
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,789
thing I want to note on the slide is

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,799
that in good in in places that have good

115
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,599
politics sometimes there will actually

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,270
be gossip about the people that are

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,340
doing negative things so they go so and

118
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,960
so you know stole somebody's idea or

119
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,440
something like that so there will be a

120
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,109
little bit of gossip so it helps to

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,490
solidify that that's bad and you know

122
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:32,070
were the good people so we all have to

123
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:36,680
work in teams especially a lot of us

124
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,580
hate networking we think it's silly but

125
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,650
what you have to understand is that

126
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,080
networking is not socializing you're not

127
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,989
going to a party with your friends you

128
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,460
were trying to learn something about the

129
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,800
people that you have to interact with

130
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:55,620
you are trying to practice some of the

131
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,110
social skills that you are trying to

132
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,270
gain and if you think about like well

133
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,060
wouldn't my job be better or wouldn't

134
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:06,560
make could I get a better job if I knew

135
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,900
more people or could I get things done

136
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,570
easier if I were able to do this better

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,239
so don't don't think of it like it's

138
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,409
supposed to be fun think of it like it's

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,419
actually with for a purpose so we can't

140
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,500
be a successful Island anymore it's just

141
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:27,270
not possible were working on security we

142
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,120
deal with lots of different groups we do

143
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,210
legal we deal with complying

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:37,490
sweet deal with developers product

145
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:40,580
people whoever so open offices are

146
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:46,280
terrible we know this but some some

147
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:48,889
people have to work in them so influence

148
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,669
will actually help us get things done in

149
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,100
these political environments so it's

150
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,690
important to note that this is not

151
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,520
manipulation we are not trying to trick

152
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,550
people into doing that I mean a kind of

153
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,030
art but it's in like not a malicious way

154
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,820
so you can learn this and acquire it but

155
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,630
we need to go into it with a couple of

156
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,090
different things

157
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:15,080
sincerity is one of them so sincerity

158
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,599
people can tell if you're not sincere

159
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,669
they can tell it from a mile away you're

160
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,410
like oh yeah thanks that's different

161
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:24,200
than like thank you so much I really

162
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,470
appreciate this like people can sell so

163
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,479
we want to build trust and confidence by

164
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,000
always being sincere when we talk to

165
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,710
people we're not trying to be fake or

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,710
not trying to be somebody that we're not

167
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,620
authenticity is the reason why small

168
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,930
talk feels kinda icky sometimes because

169
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,150
we're trying to you know pretend that

170
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,880
we're more social or we're trying to

171
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,638
boast about something that we've done or

172
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,580
just we're trying to be something that

173
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,530
we're not naturally oh like I'm not

174
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:02,900
naturally the kind of person who would

175
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:05,299
talk to you know 100 people but um but

176
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,469
you know I'm bringing my authentic self

177
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,500
I'm not I'm not trying to say that I'm

178
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:17,060
you know the world's that's anything I'm

179
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:20,870
just here as myself so we want our work

180
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,610
to stand on our own merits and and we

181
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,849
have to extend we have to reach out to

182
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,260
other people to get things done and it's

183
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:29,630
really hard to sell yourself like

184
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,490
somebody asked me like Oh tell me about

185
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,380
yourself

186
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,880
that's like the worst scenario like I

187
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,260
hate that like if you're in a room and

188
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,490
everybody's like going around and you

189
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,059
have to tell you tell something about

190
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,770
yourself like that feels really icky but

191
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:47,390
when you do it more and more

192
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:51,199
it gets easier believe me so asking for

193
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,880
help was also uncomfortable if I if I

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,790
were to trip off the stage but just

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,070
incredibly light clicks I'm very clumsy

196
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,270
but and somebody might say you know try

197
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,089
to help me up and I might be like no no

198
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,390
it's okay I got it because I'm trying to

199
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:06,950
prove that I am competent and that I can

200
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,819
actually you know walk with that falling

201
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,560
off stage we want to be seen as high

202
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,260
potential and we want to be seen as

203
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:22,040
people that that don't need help

204
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:24,110
but that actually backfires because if

205
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,430
we don't ask for help when we don't work

206
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,740
with other people then then we're seen

207
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,290
as like this the person that doesn't

208
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,950
work well with others so it's important

209
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,240
to ask for help when you need it so what

210
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,740
can we do with social engineering at

211
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,120
work we can manipulate the social system

212
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,550
once we understand where we fit in we

213
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,329
can hack it we can convince people but

214
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,130
they actually want to help us instead of

215
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,599
instead of the thing you have to we can

216
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,360
get things done more quickly we can

217
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,860
build consensus and we the most

218
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,410
important one that I've found is that

219
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,880
you can get your tasks prioritized so if

220
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,010
you call up a friend and say hey you

221
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,990
know I really need this thing and you

222
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,050
know this person really well they're

223
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,079
more likely to do your task than others

224
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,180
because it's you it's it's your friend

225
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:19,339
calling and I'm sure we can all imagine

226
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:23,510
that so you might be scared to to jump

227
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:25,790
into the political reigns at Ward tried

228
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:29,120
any of these techniques but it's worth

229
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:31,339
just going for it because it helps a

230
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,029
career in that advancement when we try

231
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:37,459
new things it builds character

232
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:42,920
we grow by learning and doing things

233
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:45,260
that we've never done before so body

234
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,800
language is extremely important and so

235
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,900
is attitude so if you have an idea at

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,939
work you might want to ask yourself like

237
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,290
do I really care about this because if

238
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,029
you don't care about it how are you

239
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,270
supposed to sell it to somebody else or

240
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,350
how

241
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,260
you're supposed to work with somebody

242
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,350
else on that so if if it's not worth

243
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,770
doing and you don't see the end being

244
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,090
something worthwhile then you know maybe

245
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:11,990
don't do it or have somebody else do it

246
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:14,480
or something because if you feel if you

247
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,520
can be confident about what you're

248
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:23,960
talking about other people will feel

249
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:26,780
that too we are and I'm gonna it was

250
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:31,130
generally people in InfoSec are highly

251
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:34,250
intelligent but we can our careers will

252
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,530
not go as far as we want them to if we

253
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,810
do not engage with other people and play

254
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,720
the political game so we kind of need to

255
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,170
learn how to do this if we want to get

256
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,680
promoted if you want to even get jobs

257
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:51,290
interviews are involved a lot of selling

258
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,359
yourself and things like that so we want

259
00:11:51,290 --> 00:12:00,680
to jump into this with our authenticity

260
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:03,250
intact so we're gonna knock stuff up

261
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,780
okay so we're gonna go into the

262
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,800
organization or if you're already there

263
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,050
you're going to do some recon and then

264
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,050
infiltrate so let's think about it like

265
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,829
like an engagement so the first thing

266
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,240
you want to do is map your humans

267
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,410
intelligence at work I mean you can go

268
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,570
as far as looking at social media

269
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,730
profiles things like that

270
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,740
but more than anything you're trying to

271
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,870
figure out who's a stakeholder who

272
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,610
already has influence who are they

273
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,680
associated with some people have like

274
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:37,700
friends from former organizations that

275
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,349
they work with they it's good to know

276
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,240
those things because if you have a

277
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,160
problem with one of them and you better

278
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,560
believe the other ones gonna have a

279
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,420
problem with the okay so you can ask

280
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,849
around you can observe you can see who

281
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,229
people talk to regularly of things like

282
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:58,490
that so we also want to look at

283
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,430
relationships and think about how people

284
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,910
relate to others at work so do people

285
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:08,959
like to meet a lunch and go out to lunch

286
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:11,089
do people go to meetings

287
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,630
or do they hate having meetings and they

288
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:19,070
just want to have one-on-one

289
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:20,089
conversations how do people talk are you

290
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,190
go into a meeting and then just

291
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:23,779
brainstorm ideas or if you go into a

292
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,870
meeting are you expected to have a slide

293
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:30,050
deck with like all the answers in it so

294
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,940
it's good to know that and you can ask

295
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,380
other people how they've had success if

296
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,870
you're trying to get something done and

297
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,450
you see somebody else has a successful

298
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,540
program going on just talk to them say

299
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,690
you know I this is really this is going

300
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,050
well for you you know what do you think

301
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:50,570
helped you make this a success

302
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:53,540
people will help you everybody wants to

303
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,810
help as much as possible so we're also

304
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,939
looking at decision making our decisions

305
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,029
being made on the spot in a meeting or

306
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,920
does the manager the influencers so they

307
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:05,839
want to take that information back and

308
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,449
then think about it before they make a

309
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,399
decision some people are more likely to

310
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,779
make snap decisions and some people want

311
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,279
all the info and they want to analyze it

312
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,080
for a week

313
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,290
both ways are perfectly valid but it's

314
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,910
good to understand how that works

315
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,310
sometimes in a meeting when there's a

316
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:26,930
question people will physically turn

317
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:29,150
their bodies to someone who is more than

318
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,829
likely an influencer so that's something

319
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,449
that we look we're gonna look at where

320
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:37,010
we're trying to be cognizant of what's

321
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:39,040
going on in in meetings at work who's

322
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:44,000
getting asked the questions who's

323
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,219
helping to make the final decisions so

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,640
that once we find out that we know who

325
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,180
to influence we know that info informal

326
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,620
influencers are not always the managers

327
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:58,790
sometimes they're like a senior tech

328
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:02,450
person so understanding not just the

329
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:07,250
hierarchy of position but also the

330
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:10,160
hierarchy of knowledge and influence so

331
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,290
sometimes you will notice that some

332
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,630
people are advocates for security and

333
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:19,219
some people are blockers people who are

334
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,430
asked to do work will sometimes be

335
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,640
blockers so it's

336
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,739
important to think about that as we're

337
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:32,810
as we're trying to figure out how we're

338
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,820
going to get things done and melty goes

339
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,430
up one way you can do this you're

340
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,960
interested in that another thing we can

341
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,910
do is team up with somebody who's really

342
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,030
well networked

343
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:46,790
the people that are well networked

344
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,680
usually don't know one thing really deep

345
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,860
they know a little bit about everything

346
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,660
they know a little bit of everybody so

347
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,910
people who are well networked need

348
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,610
people who are deep technical it's it's

349
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,990
a symbiotic relationship so find someone

350
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,850
who can help you and befriend them so

351
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,250
body language is really important we

352
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,650
know this we had body language longer

353
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,970
than speech so you know when we're

354
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,410
talking to somebody and we're asking

355
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,850
them to do something we're asking them

356
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,670
for help you're not going to be like hey

357
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm sorry to ask you for the help but I

358
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,229
need some help it's better to be like

359
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,820
hey this exciting project like you know

360
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,340
the body language is something that

361
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,530
people will notice so you know we we

362
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,030
want to even if we're nervous you need

363
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,319
to kind of pitch your voice a little bit

364
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,870
lower because you start to talk like

365
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,040
this if you get really excited so just

366
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:39,050
some some body language tips also one

367
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
thing that we do unconsciously is that

368
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,189
we mirror people that we have rapport

369
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,050
with so sometimes you'll see like people

370
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,540
in a circle all talking and they all

371
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,979
have one hand in their hip or if they're

372
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,959
at a table they all have their hands

373
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,460
like this or they all have their hands

374
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,830
like this that's because they have

375
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,480
rapport so if you don't have that with

376
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,680
somebody and they're sitting there with

377
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,840
their legs crossed and their arms back

378
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,119
and you're sitting forward you can

379
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:07,400
mirror them on purpose not unconsciously

380
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:09,139
also if they are closed off and they've

381
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,200
got their arms crossed and they're

382
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,440
sitting back or whatever you can you can

383
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,470
make yourself more open like physically

384
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:23,350
open and it can draw them out a little

385
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:25,700
bit so timing is really important

386
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,990
there's a layoff next week it might not

387
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:31,100
be the best time to ask for a million

388
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:33,830
dollars when people get stressed they

389
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,850
tend to make decisions really quickly

390
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,960
they tend to stick with what they know

391
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,070
and they're not well

392
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,990
to try new things so so we want to know

393
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,418
what's going on in the greater ecosystem

394
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:54,380
of the company or the industry or

395
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:57,080
whatever to help time our our efforts so

396
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,490
reading the room is another one of those

397
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,850
things what we're trying to be cognizant

398
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,360
of what's going on our people board our

399
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,649
people upset is it like 4 p.m. on a

400
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,100
Friday and people don't want to be in a

401
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:10,100
meeting

402
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,070
is it the closed body language open body

403
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,139
language things like that another thing

404
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,629
we can if there is some kind of strife

405
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,440
like there is a layoff then maybe we can

406
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,600
use that in a positive way to spend our

407
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,789
request for something like well we're

408
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,820
going to have less people to do this we

409
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:30,620
need a tool to do it and that could be a

410
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,149
potential way that you can flip that

411
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:39,918
around so empathy is really important

412
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:41,539
when it comes to all of this it starts

413
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,289
with gratitude and this is something

414
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:49,340
that I I personally try to practice and

415
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:53,059
every day like just out of you know who

416
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,559
I am I try to be very thankful if

417
00:18:53,059 --> 00:19:00,799
somebody does even like the smallest

418
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:02,928
thing I'm very thankful I make sure that

419
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:08,389
people understand how much what they've

420
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:11,360
done means to me we also need to be kind

421
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,750
to people talking down to them is not

422
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,399
going to endear them to you this is

423
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,350
something that you know smart people

424
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:22,729
sometimes do we start talking about

425
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,230
really high level things and and or we

426
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,990
start like oh no well that's that's just

427
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:31,820
stupid we can't do that like being nicer

428
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:33,679
about it is going to help you and also

429
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,830
make sure that your teams do this too

430
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,600
because your team reflects on you so so

431
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,879
you need to hold all of your team

432
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,389
members accountable for being kind to

433
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,370
other teams for for for just you know

434
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:49,610
their behavior as it relates to other

435
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:53,020
people when people have been effect

436
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:55,639
phoof and they've helped you after that

437
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,879
we want to show them that they've helped

438
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,240
we want to say like thanks to you we did

439
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,520
this thing and it was awesome

440
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,720
and it saved us money and I did this and

441
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,429
that so we want to show them that

442
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,690
they've helped because it makes them

443
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:13,030
want to help again in the future it

444
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,770
makes them feel like they've actually

445
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,299
contributed something and when you're

446
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,139
not contributing I mean I know that

447
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,760
feeling

448
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,830
you've you feel kind of that like

449
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,690
useless and it's nice to feel needed

450
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,689
it's nice to feel helpful

451
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:30,260
positive reinforcement you know thanks

452
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,980
for that thing that you did I really

453
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,179
appreciate it

454
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,770
going to their manager saying hey I

455
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,900
really appreciate that what your

456
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:40,840
employee did things like that making

457
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,890
sure that that that you were and you are

458
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,740
telling them when they've done the right

459
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:50,450
thing because we want to keep that going

460
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:52,790
on if there is something that you want

461
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:57,290
to do that you know is going to cost

462
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:59,090
money money not so much but if it's

463
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,270
going to require a lot more time from

464
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:05,059
another team or it's going to slow them

465
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:07,220
down or it's going to change their

466
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:09,379
workflow or something like that we need

467
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,410
to acknowledge that we know that that's

468
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:16,010
going to happen like I know that if we

469
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:17,390
start doing code scans and you've never

470
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,429
done code scans before it's going to

471
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,380
take more time and I acknowledge that

472
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:24,790
I'm gonna work with you to make sure

473
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:28,280
that it doesn't impact you too much and

474
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:30,379
I'm gonna make sure that it's acceptable

475
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,059
in the way that we're doing in we're not

476
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,919
just going to come down and say this is

477
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:39,230
what we're doing so I think that's

478
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:41,750
really important saying oh and if you

479
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,919
did something wrong with it just say I'm

480
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:49,880
sorry that was totally my fault it will

481
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:55,610
make people being vulnerable will make

482
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:58,790
people relate to you it's if you always

483
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:01,679
fear oh if you're never wrong people

484
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:04,560
don't like people who are never wrong

485
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,650
so we can we can't change other people

486
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,470
we know this but we can nudge people in

487
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,870
the right direction so so we want to

488
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,760
present things in a certain way we want

489
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,439
to we want to make people think that

490
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,170
think that the choices that they're

491
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,820
making are their decisions so we give

492
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:26,580
them the illusion of choice so we want

493
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,860
to talk about one option not five we

494
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,510
have what if we have five vendors that

495
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,330
we're looking at but one of them is the

496
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,190
one that we think we should go with

497
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:38,790
don't show them all five show them the

498
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,860
one and then talk about the one and then

499
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,050
people will focus on the one then you

500
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,679
can say well there's these two other

501
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:48,000
five other vendors whatever and but

502
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,520
people will still be focused on the

503
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,840
first one we're much less likely if

504
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,430
somebody says hey let's have pizza

505
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,959
tonight for dinner and then you talk

506
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,210
about pizza for five minutes and then

507
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,190
somebody's like well we go for hot dogs

508
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,660
everybody else is going to be like no we

509
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:06,030
already talked about pizza really wants

510
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:11,780
pizza now so so trying to focus on on

511
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:15,720
the wanton rather than the many when we

512
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,250
we see this a lot in in actual politics

513
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,450
like if you've ever seen like house of

514
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:23,190
cards or something like that where where

515
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:27,210
you're you go to an individual to get

516
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,760
there to get their their support you go

517
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:32,370
to an individual to make sure that when

518
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,129
you go into the group setting that the

519
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,870
individual is going to be on your side

520
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,150
so if you can do that five six seven

521
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,860
times when those seven when there's nine

522
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,570
people in a meeting you have seven

523
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:47,850
people on your side the other two are

524
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:50,580
more likely to to agree as well if

525
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:53,580
people are starting to get off topic and

526
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,080
you don't want to you don't like the way

527
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,760
it's going you can play devil's advocate

528
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:02,460
and you can ask questions like our like

529
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,580
are we making the right decision have we

530
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,530
considered this issue that kind of thing

531
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,590
to bring people back to where we want

532
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:13,740
them to be and when people come up with

533
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,669
the idea that you have or reinforce it

534
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,490
we can say

535
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,590
that was a really good idea yes I like

536
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,920
that and and tell them that even if it

537
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:25,889
was your idea

538
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,230
so we talking to people we're gonna know

539
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,270
this a little bit questions make small

540
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,670
talk easy everybody wants to talk about

541
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:36,060
themselves I practice this on uber

542
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:38,520
drivers for like a year and it worked

543
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,520
really well so I'm asking people about

544
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,190
themselves we're not interrogating them

545
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,770
but asking open-ended questions like

546
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:50,130
let's say I'm in an uber and I say like

547
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:52,110
so is this your full-time job or you

548
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,250
know what how long have you been doing

549
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,830
this or something like that it just

550
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,350
starts a conversation and if you have

551
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,669
something to add like if somebody you

552
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,250
find out somebody has a dog and you have

553
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,020
a dog say oh yeah I've got a tug to

554
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:08,160
sharing that creates bonding and

555
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:12,540
personal experience that shared active

556
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,130
listening is important it can feel a

557
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,590
little bit contrived but if somebody

558
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,660
says I went to Hawaii last week and you

559
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,870
say oh you went to Hawaii repeating that

560
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,340
the word that they use even if it's you

561
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,969
know something other than this but

562
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,649
similar it's it's another thing like the

563
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,390
body language thing it's showing that

564
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,790
you're listening it's showing that you

565
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,790
are the same because people like people

566
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:39,180
who are the same it's it's one of the

567
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,500
biases so you don't know how to paying

568
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,320
attention or not being on your phone

569
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:47,730
things like that that's always that we

570
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:51,379
we can listen actively so when we ask

571
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:54,480
for help if we can shift the focus of

572
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:58,530
the purpose of the help to the benefits

573
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,570
like if you can help with this it will

574
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,820
save the company a bunch of money or if

575
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,639
you can help with this it will save you

576
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,610
time down low down the road we want them

577
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,170
to want to help if they feel like they

578
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,699
have to they're not going to give it

579
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:18,240
their all they may not even do it so if

580
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:22,530
you can kind of prime people day to day

581
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,590
and say talk about things that are

582
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,660
coming up and talking about how

583
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,389
important it's going to be then when you

584
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,040
actually ask them

585
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:37,120
for help they're more likely to help as

586
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:41,440
well so we don't want to make it seem

587
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:45,159
like we are demanding what they help if

588
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,780
we use Authority sometimes we can do

589
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,380
that and say all my managers making me

590
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,720
do this

591
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,400
but we want to we want to make it more

592
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,920
positive so instead of my managers

593
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,110
making me do this project I need your

594
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,390
help if we say my manager said you're

595
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,429
the best person for the job and that I

596
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:03,460
should talk to you you were the you know

597
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,870
you're the owner of this and you've been

598
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,420
the go-to person for this for a while

599
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:11,649
then that's much more positive way to

600
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:13,240
talk about it may I ask you a favor

601
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,750
things like that where people have to

602
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,850
say yes before the favor not a good way

603
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,740
to do it if we say I'm sorry to ask you

604
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:23,469
this you're trying to get like

605
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:27,610
diminishing yourself you're diminishing

606
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:30,100
the ask other things so you know it's

607
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:34,030
it's it's not just a tiny thing it's

608
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,219
it's important and it's it gives you

609
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:40,210
purpose and you're going to help the

610
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,250
company if we are too vulnerable and we

611
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,440
ask for help I mean we we all know those

612
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,330
people that they email like a group disk

613
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,690
drove something that they could have

614
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:51,580
googled in like two seconds don't be

615
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,740
that person and only ask for help when

616
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,780
you really need it and when it's

617
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:00,730
important and make sure that you ask the

618
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:02,260
right person using just using the word

619
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,990
together when we talk about something

620
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:08,410
saying we instead of I these are things

621
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:10,770
that can help us think about being part

622
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:13,510
of a team being part of a larger

623
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:18,129
experience and creating a sense of group

624
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:20,110
it's very important having those

625
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,260
one-on-one conversations before we bring

626
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:27,100
people into larger can not only make it

627
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:29,500
so that you get their support but you

628
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,480
can also answer questions that other

629
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,980
people may have so that when you go into

630
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,770
the larger setting you've got those

631
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:42,610
answers ready to go if if you promise to

632
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:45,910
do something don't let them down

633
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:47,889
if you can it will set a bad precedent

634
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:52,630
and it will make them not trust your

635
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:56,710
trust is easy to have and difficult to

636
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:59,470
regain so if you always go to somebody

637
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,390
and you just are asking them for stuff

638
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,220
they're gonna assume that you're asking

639
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:06,100
them for stuff and that's the only

640
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,270
reason you're talking to them so that's

641
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,409
for empathy and building these

642
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:13,179
relationships and building up capital

643
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,799
social capital before you need it it's

644
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,360
important you can't go to them like the

645
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,220
same day and learn all about the kids

646
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,439
and their family in their their dogs and

647
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,520
everything and then ask for help right

648
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,910
away you have to build those

649
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:29,590
relationships over time so when we when

650
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,660
we propose something there will be

651
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:36,159
people that resist change in fact most

652
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:42,070
people resist change because it makes

653
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:45,250
our lives harder so we we want to have

654
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,460
answers to what's going to happen after

655
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,750
the change so if there is going to be

656
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,380
more time that's going to be spent in

657
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:55,540
the development process acknowledge that

658
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:59,549
make sure that you have an answer for

659
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,600
how that's going to be handled if if

660
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,820
you're like okay it's just going to take

661
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,100
more time people are going to fight it

662
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,850
more so so we want to give people time

663
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:13,168
to to accept the new idea we want to

664
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:16,559
like plant a seed of an idea and then

665
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:19,390
have it grow so you start talking about

666
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,160
well we should really be doing this and

667
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,270
people are like oh no we can't do that

668
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,730
we don't at the time we don't have the

669
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,320
budget talk about it some more talk

670
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:30,730
about it as part of compliance talk

671
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,189
about some article bring bring more

672
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:36,250
information to them about what you're

673
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,410
trying to do over time and give them

674
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,000
time to accept it because sudden change

675
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:44,590
a lot of people are just going to be

676
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,860
like no if there's a hard decision that

677
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:50,970
needs to be made think and ask questions

678
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,949
that make them think more about the

679
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,320
results but negative results I guess I

680
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:59,100
should say positive too

681
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,480
but what's the risk if we don't do this

682
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,449
what are the what's the best-case

683
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,989
scenario it's the worst case scenario if

684
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:10,119
we have trusted people that know a lot

685
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:14,019
about a topic bring them in to give

686
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:17,799
their opinions start small do like a

687
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:22,960
test run like we do hate clients like

688
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:24,850
guinea pig situations try those so that

689
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,249
you can show success and then make sure

690
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,209
that they work because if they don't

691
00:31:27,249 --> 00:31:32,619
you're not getting any further some

692
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,710
people will come out as winner here some

693
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:37,779
people come will come out as losers if

694
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:41,169
in certain situations if developers have

695
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:44,739
to spend more time then it impacts

696
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:47,350
downstream to products and customers and

697
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:49,389
things like that so we need to have

698
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,488
somebody with enough authority running

699
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:54,070
these things so you need to get up to

700
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:56,980
that authority point for certain things

701
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,720
that affect other groups and you need to

702
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:04,389
have buy-in from the top buying from the

703
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:07,119
top is really important people who are

704
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:09,998
going to fight you have trying to think

705
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,889
about what if you were in their

706
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:14,230
situation what you would say what you

707
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:16,479
would think so that when they say it you

708
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,190
can respond because if you're like I

709
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,590
hadn't thought about that it's really

710
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:25,090
gonna diminish your position make sure

711
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,918
that you don't start like

712
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:32,709
over-explaining and and getting really

713
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,600
nervous about it because if we're

714
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,549
nervous we start to over explain things

715
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,158
people are gonna stop listening they're

716
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:42,609
gonna instantly recognize that we're not

717
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,619
prepared and and if somebody comes at

718
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:47,980
you and says well this is a stupid idea

719
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:50,259
don't attack back ask them why try to

720
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,840
get them to talk about it anything other

721
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:56,889
than just trying to be shut down or

722
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,928
shutting them down what is stopping you

723
00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:01,178
from saying yes this is like a sales

724
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:02,919
technique used all around the world I

725
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,570
think right

726
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,029
you're trying to buy a car and you're

727
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,290
like I don't know and well what do I got

728
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:12,049
to do to get you into this car today

729
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:15,379
same kind of thing but it gives it gives

730
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:19,780
them a chance to express their concerns

731
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,780
even if they may not have been asked

732
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,780
some people just aren't gonna care and

733
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,678
they're not gonna want to help

734
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:30,049
so escalating up the train can sometimes

735
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,870
help if we can make our point to the

736
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:35,570
next person above the person that we

737
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,428
were talking to sometimes we can go up

738
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,610
to our management and our management can

739
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:44,330
go across to the other side and then

740
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:48,590
back down so that's that's one way to

741
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:52,580
use Authority something else that is

742
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:55,459
really useful is using FOMO so if you

743
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,439
can say oh well you know I'm sorry you

744
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,830
don't want to help this is gonna be a

745
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,080
huge visibility project that you know is

746
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,370
going all the way up to the board but

747
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:10,668
you know I'll let them know you weren't

748
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:12,888
interested so long terms for Heather to

749
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:16,580
use we're just trying to build trust and

750
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:19,369
and earn trust and keep trust because

751
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:22,569
once we lose it it's gone being sincere

752
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:27,440
being authentic who we really are

753
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:29,379
sticking to our promises cultivating the

754
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,659
relationship before we need them

755
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:35,089
practicing kindness and and helping

756
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,770
other people when they ask for help we

757
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,570
can't just ask them for help all the

758
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:43,190
time we have to be able to help them too

759
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:46,340
sometimes and if you decide to take a

760
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:48,409
risk that could cost you social capital

761
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,240
think about that like if you're gonna go

762
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,300
against somebody who's been an ally that

763
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,319
could be you may not want to do that you

764
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,230
may want to think of a different way to

765
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,970
go about it

766
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,810
admitting mistakes I'm sorry that was

767
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:04,160
completely my fault I was wrong

768
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,840
letting other people win sometimes I

769
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,000
have a friend who's like the worst loser

770
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,480
in the world and he doesn't want to play

771
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,340
video games with me if if I win too much

772
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,249
so sometimes I just let him win so we

773
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:20,499
can keep playing

774
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:24,680
um flattery is not good but sincerity is

775
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:27,319
if you really like you know their car or

776
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,879
whatever whatever the thing is if you

777
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:31,308
really like it talk about it if you

778
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,430
don't people can tell but you're being

779
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:35,839
fake just appreciating others for what

780
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,680
they can do trying to see the good in

781
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,719
people giving people control over the

782
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,209
outcome of what they do so if you ask

783
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:46,670
them to help you letting them decide how

784
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:47,899
they help you don't don't I seem to help

785
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,400
you and then tell them exactly what to

786
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,209
do because they may have a better idea

787
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:57,109
and they actually may be able to do it

788
00:35:53,209 --> 00:36:02,450
better set aside your ego ask for help

789
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:05,719
don't be afraid to be vulnerable last

790
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,078
thing is remote work can make this a lot

791
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:08,059
harder

792
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,759
I've worked full time remote I have for

793
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:12,979
like 15 years so what I'll do is I'll

794
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:15,289
dial in to meetings early and I'll make

795
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:18,799
small talk with people in the meeting

796
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:21,440
before the call starts when I had a team

797
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:23,779
before our team meeting started I would

798
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,160
ask some how their weekends were I would

799
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:26,959
you know make a little bit of small talk

800
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,609
just then instead of getting right down

801
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:30,799
to business

802
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:32,660
if you're let's say you're like chatting

803
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:35,479
with somebody and you feel like okay

804
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,368
we've done keep talking to them like ask

805
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:41,660
them you know like how they've been or

806
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:45,709
what are they're working on video I hate

807
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:49,249
video but but video chats are definitely

808
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:52,149
more effective my company now you know

809
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:55,129
uses a lot of video and I have to admit

810
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:57,949
it is I'm still I'm still in pajamas but

811
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,989
I have to admit but it is really helpful

812
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,430
setting up one-on-one calls you can just

813
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:04,339
reach out to touch base you don't have

814
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,140
to be asking for something you can try

815
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:08,058
to meet in person a few times a year

816
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:11,719
schedule like an outing or an off-site

817
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:15,219
or go to the headquarters or whatever be

818
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:19,699
silly share has fair funny images and

819
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:22,779
talk about things in fact that are not

820
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:26,449
necessarily work-related and meet daily

821
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:27,589
if you have like a team meeting we like

822
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:31,729
15 minutes

823
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:33,529
in the morning it it leads to all of

824
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:35,089
these things all of these things happen

825
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:38,529
with some people join early some people

826
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:41,299
talk about stuff it works really well so

827
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:43,579
we got over now it was a politics exists

828
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:47,150
and participate if we want to get things

829
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:49,190
done if you are not naturally a politics

830
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:53,239
person and not naturally a people person

831
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:55,160
fake it till you make it not and not too

832
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,469
much faking like I'm not the King of

833
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,979
Prussia or whatever but like you can

834
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:03,609
fake you can try to hide some of your

835
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:05,930
uncomfortableness I guess I should say

836
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:07,700
making sure that you have influence and

837
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,879
relationships in place before you need

838
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,879
them

839
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,269
empathy will lead to influence so making

840
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:17,269
sure that you understand other people's

841
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:20,779
motivations other people's needs and

842
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:22,839
that and we can craft some outcomes or

843
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:24,859
have some influence on how things work

844
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:28,058
so that's my thing

845
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,058
thank you for coming

846
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:56,250
we have time for questions okay any

847
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:58,470
questions how does the question is how

848
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,410
do you counter if somebody thinks that

849
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:03,540
you're trying to manipulate them that's

850
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,700
a really good question that's one of the

851
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,490
reasons actually that I didn't allow

852
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:12,240
this to be recorded in my last job this

853
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:15,180
has only been recorded once before I I

854
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:19,350
think that you can emphasize that you

855
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,529
are you're trying to get things done for

856
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:25,319
the right reasons and and that you're

857
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:27,840
not being malicious you're not you're

858
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,080
not being inauthentic I mean you're as

859
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,480
long as you follow these rules and you

860
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,730
can argue that yes you are trying to

861
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,800
influence your project or your the

862
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,240
outcome of something but it's not

863
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,190
malicious you're not hurting anybody

864
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,620
you're not trying to hurt them you're

865
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,680
not trying to you know social engineer

866
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,910
them in a way that you're going to break

867
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,350
into their bank account or something

868
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:59,220
like it's not that kind of thing it's

869
00:39:49,350 --> 00:40:01,569
this is just how politics work okay well

870
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,979
thank you very much

871
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,979
[Applause]
