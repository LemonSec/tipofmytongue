1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
the last presentation of the day so

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,670
hopefully I will punish you too much and

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,010
we can get down to the real the real

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,960
business of drinking and frolicking and

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,540
such so the title of my talk today it's

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,029
gonna be after Mariah cyber security

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,349
implications of IOT botnet proliferation

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,698
against critical infrastructure so a

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,010
little bit of business at the beginning

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,340
of this of course the infamous

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,170
disclaimer contents presentation and the

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,910
statements is presented or the opinions

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,649
of the presenter and in no way are

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,569
reflective of any employee or any other

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,190
entities view opposition hunting

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,360
business presentation is not intended to

17
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,230
be construed as original research but

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,800
for informational and educational

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:54,390
purposes only so I start off by quoting

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,360
myself here if you're gonna quote

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,730
somebody when I quote yourself right so

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,879
I said without the proliferation

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,789
trending towards 25 billion devices by

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,320
2020 the threat surface for coordinated

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,119
attacks to be directed at critical

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,059
infrastructure targets will grow

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,060
exponentially outpacing our ability to

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,430
effectively detect and respond to cyber

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,659
threats against just kind of keep this

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,909
in mind as we go through this

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,580
presentation and start thinking about

32
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,170
what this actually means in the context

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,580
of critical infrastructure and the

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,130
things that we need use everyday things

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,289
are unlike power generation or around

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,060
heart of water pipelines or oil and gas

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,500
refining and it tells me so the talk not

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,869
the talk everyone's thinking about above

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,079
the talk that we're sitting at a little

40
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:48,229
bit about me kind of a back story around

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,309
IOT IOT and why we even care about it

42
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:52,140
course there'll be a primary a little

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,060
bit of a primary information and then

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,360
we'll kind of dive in to my rock and

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,090
kind of the impetus of this whole

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,450
conversation some interesting things

47
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,490
about it what's happened since more so a

48
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,878
merabh being kind of the first of its

49
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,579
type what's happened since then other

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,790
IOT botnets connectedness and

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,349
convergence this

52
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,429
something that you'll hear a lot about

53
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,738
your continue to hear a lot about

54
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,750
certainly as we all kind of dive into

55
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,750
the industry report Auto and automation

56
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,010
it's mark this is Mark that threats to

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,120
critical infrastructure and control

58
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,679
systems supply chain implications

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,180
countermeasures capabilities then we'll

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,709
kind of bring it all together at the end

61
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,340
and then of course there will be some

62
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:40,239
time for Q&A and such sound fair so I'm

63
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,819
good all right so a little bit about me

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
I've been doing this 27 years so really

65
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,689
long time

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,239
hence why I have no hair I have

67
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:50,530
experience in most of the 16 critical

68
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,489
infrastructure surfaces and I actually

69
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:57,159
have expertise in about half of them and

70
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:58,689
I'm also as a have expertise and

71
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,540
discrete and continuous process

72
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:03,220
manufacturing what that means is

73
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,970
pharmaceuticals things like food

74
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,919
beverage processing milling CNC machines

75
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,069
or pretty much anything that you can

76
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:16,989
automate I've probably done

77
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:19,899
diehard Saints fan who dad I am the lead

78
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,970
global ot security program leader for a

79
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,739
fortune 500 oil and gas little stream

80
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,900
company I'm a husband my wife was in the

81
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,229
audience here I'm a father a research

82
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,639
and a wine manager as you can imagine a

83
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,310
wine manager means I manage all

84
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:41,440
everyone's wine now even when wine cries

85
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:45,040
bitches complain seven sort of back

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,590
story just in case you were wondering so

87
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,629
little bit about IOT and IOT probably

88
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,879
everyone in this room unless you've been

89
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,879
living under a rock on their stone knows

90
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,620
what I owe to your IOT is but just for

91
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,078
the sake of leveling will will give the

92
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,159
tech target definition of it it's one of

93
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,949
my favorite one of my favorite

94
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,810
definitions of the Internet of Things is

95
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,359
a system of interrelated computing

96
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,879
devices mechanical and digital machines

97
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:12,009
objects animals or people that are

98
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,989
provided with unique identifies an

99
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,449
ability to transfer data over a network

100
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:20,289
without requiring human to human or

101
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:24,219
human to computer interaction what all

102
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:26,580
right so I our ot or industrial Internet

103
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:30,690
of Things is IOT but

104
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,669
we care about machine data analytics

105
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,100
decision support and control feedback

106
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,930
and we'll talk about these as we move

107
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,630
into why some of the threats and why

108
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,540
this is important but really what we

109
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,669
need to know about IOT is that there's

110
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,340
some data being collected that data

111
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,169
being processed somehow and that David

112
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,388
may move to something else to the cloud

113
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,710
to a file share to a something that's

114
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,600
really all you need to know for out idle

115
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:00,940
T for the purposes of this so Mirai a

116
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,610
good friend Murat why is it such a

117
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,360
game-changer so Mariah was the world's

118
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:10,150
first significantly complex IOT botnet

119
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,750
now it was not the world's first coyote

120
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:21,400
botnet you had lytx Adira and then you

121
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:24,430
also had what was it think of bash like

122
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,530
I believe was the other there were a lot

123
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,080
more simple they weren't nearly as

124
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,340
complex they weren't nearly as as

125
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,320
distributed as of course mariah has

126
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,969
originally targeted consumer devices so

127
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,669
routers look consumer routers in that

128
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,140
kind of thing but not so much more and

129
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,169
we'll talk about that a little bit as we

130
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,930
continue to go down this journey

131
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,250
had some very potent variants to name a

132
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,600
few Satan

133
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,690
Masuda kurma suta and a few others the

134
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,450
Barents were also used in crypto mining

135
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:01,900
particularly for more narrow highly

136
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,400
adaptable very difficult to detect and

137
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,440
last but not least highly prolific

138
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,450
meaning that they could spread really

139
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,789
really quickly and really really fast so

140
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,340
some interesting things so we are now up

141
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,740
to seven different variants of Morocco

142
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,320
that are active in the wild today that

143
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,669
are attacking various types of devices

144
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:27,250
various types of components everything

145
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:30,940
from DVRs to baby monitor cameras the

146
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:33,160
ecosystem of devices expanding enhance

147
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,830
the threat surface right so the area in

148
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,780
which you can attack it's independent

149
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,300
and a new processor types or being

150
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,729
incorporated as well

151
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,680
not only are we just targeting very

152
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,229
simple devices and simple assets now

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,680
more targeting of the entire process of

154
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,750
cameras with this solution the actors

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,599
are getting smarter kind of goes without

156
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,729
saying right each time a variant is

157
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,789
created so every time we see a variant

158
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:02,310
change we see some of these exponential

159
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,909
jumps and intelligence inside of the

160
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,139
variants

161
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:10,139
and lastly attack assets may unwittingly

162
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:14,219
be a unmeant unwittingly be aware that

163
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:16,469
they are part of a mirage or for its

164
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:17,969
appearance so as if this kind of the

165
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,699
zombie to it right so they may not even

166
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:25,349
realize that they're part of anybody

167
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,669
build ecosystem so sense morale and why

168
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:28,139
is this interesting to critical

169
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,490
infrastructure probes like myself and

170
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,620
perhaps some of you so there's a number

171
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,979
of other IOT botnets they're out there

172
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,659
and I'm sorry that came across a little

173
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,810
small I'm trying to make it bigger they

174
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:46,469
just didn't work out on the lake but one

175
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,110
of them is gonna be Hajji me another

176
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:50,669
it's gonna be Reaper no there's gonna be

177
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,210
Sartorius so let's talk about the Jamie

178
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,080
for a minute

179
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,400
so after Murat hit and it was introduced

180
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,300
and it kind of scared the living hell

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,830
out of everybody the developer said you

182
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,120
know what we need to one-up and we need

183
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,479
to want to offend ante so we're gonna

184
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,690
come in with a Hazim now a genie he is

185
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,699
not is it's not only a botnet but it is

186
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,150
actually a platform in and of itself and

187
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,009
inside of that platform this become this

188
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,799
marginalization and so each one of these

189
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,779
modules can have crypto tools operating

190
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,759
it could have other scripts being

191
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,710
running all types of other things that

192
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,460
are deployed as part of the payload

193
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,338
itself which means that if I you impact

194
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,890
the machine with this buy or get or get

195
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,199
zombie into this botnet you're now

196
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,269
participating not only as a carrier but

197
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:41,039
you're also participating prepared

198
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,409
potentially in escalating attacks

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,529
against something else right that's some

200
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:49,140
other infrastructure whether it be just

201
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,220
an ordinary endpoint like a laptop or it

202
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,600
could be a piece of critical

203
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,110
infrastructure right it could be up

204
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,019
hills

205
00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:00,750
a sensor it could be a gateway to be a

206
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:05,029
reaper there's a little more a little

207
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:08,790
more interesting again highly complex

208
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:11,010
certainly kind of deals a pawn

209
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,230
again what hajima was able to do and

210
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,930
again is still more even more modular

211
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,519
and so what we're seeing as an evolution

212
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,769
of these IOT botnets is they're becoming

213
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,890
more modular they're becoming more

214
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:25,380
platform capable with reaper

215
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,000
particularly it can talk to a number of

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,240
different platforms a number of

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,550
different device classes even within the

218
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,200
same code they'll pay load so when

219
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,180
you're trying to monitor for this stuff

220
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,510
or when you're trying to dissect what it

221
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,300
is it actually can talk to different

222
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,640
types of hardware to talk different

223
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,439
types of systems and it can subvert and

224
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,990
be very stealthy in the process of doing

225
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,760
that a Satori Satori in who is really

226
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,950
kind of its kind of arrived with some

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,740
extras more or less that's kind of a

228
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,810
little bit of a modification it does it

229
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:05,579
is a bit more prolific it does have a

230
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:07,768
bit more move I suppose the last one of

231
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,359
these is Tory so it just by show of

232
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,380
hands how many people have heard of the

233
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,190
Tory I will keep by now just by Vasily

234
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:21,209
okay so I had one in audience okay

235
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,550
so Tory is an evolution beyond the

236
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:27,449
substructure of Mirai so everything

237
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:31,019
above Tory is a variant of some sort of

238
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:33,420
more right it is it uses some behavior

239
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:37,500
or something that looks like mariah and

240
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:41,069
it is derived from it Tory is a brand

241
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,890
new platform and not only is a brand new

242
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,740
platform but in in fact can operate on

243
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:50,130
any platform there is it has the ability

244
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,470
to scan and reach into and effective in

245
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,899
device figure out what that device can

246
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,430
run what kind of processor it has what

247
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,740
kind of memory capacity it has what kind

248
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,770
of memory it has and able to formulate

249
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,300
on the fly and exploit to actually

250
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,510
operate against that platform

251
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,719
today we are not seeing torii being

252
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,450
targeted against anything however what

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,400
we believe is that Tory is going to be

254
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,110
this next evolution that is really gonna

255
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,079
give critical infrastructure a nightmare

256
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,330
because now I'm walking I'm taking this

257
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,280
piece of botnet and I'm gonna stick it

258
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,470
in an environment that has that is

259
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,780
heterogeneous as it as it comes in

260
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,760
critical approach and now I'm getting

261
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,920
ready to you know potentially release an

262
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,900
IOT botnet in there that's gonna do all

263
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,790
of that heavy lifting for me as opposed

264
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,439
to having to live it persist in an

265
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,480
environment for years to try and

266
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,230
understand what the ecosystem is so this

267
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,820
is kind of something to think about

268
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,050
so connectedness and convergence you'll

269
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,210
hear this word time and time again

270
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,949
certainly as you're as we go down our

271
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,020
industry portal journey and this whole

272
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,690
notion of converging itno T in all this

273
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,510
business industrial environments have

274
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,440
become more connected and more converged

275
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,900
pretty much goes without saying the

276
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,850
businesses interested in knowing what is

277
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,319
happening within their processes if

278
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,030
they're doing automation did whether

279
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,640
it's discrete or continuous processing

280
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,110
how fast are things being produced how

281
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,380
much money are we spending to produce

282
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,390
per unit how much time or the machines

283
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,430
running it so on and so forth things

284
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,380
that if you can get really smart about

285
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,589
that stuff then you can save money and

286
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,090
cut costs increased demand for the

287
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,190
business for optimization of visibility

288
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,230
again wanting to see what's actually

289
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,450
happening in near real-time and being

290
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,720
able to extract any information in a

291
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:37,600
reasonable fashion the cloud and I put

292
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,370
the cloud in exclamation or in quotation

293
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,690
marks because the cloud can mean a lot

294
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,480
of needs to a lot of different people

295
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,310
right we assume that the cloud means

296
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,720
that it's something external to us this

297
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,890
is kind of nebulous thing sitting out

298
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,630
there that's taking data and doing

299
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,280
something with it but that cloud could

300
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,380
also be internal to an environment right

301
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,589
it doesn't necessarily have to be out in

302
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,590
the ether

303
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:03,220
lots of available data to be stolen and

304
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,410
I'm just serious right so all of this

305
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,940
data is being lifted from these machines

306
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,260
that's being lifted from these assets

307
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,020
it's being lifted from these gateways

308
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,120
and being sent into a young Nathan

309
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,160
alright and so it's a you know it's a

310
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,420
lot of data it's not a later I'm not a

311
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,350
little I know a lot of date of course

312
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,969
cycle

313
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,160
but it certainly you have tens of

314
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,540
thousands of sensors that's a lot David

315
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,329
I think the petition would be a lot a

316
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:29,650
lot of it and then the standards aren't

317
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:31,750
quite unified so in IOT particularly

318
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,730
even though many of the protocols have

319
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,070
been standardized the actual

320
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,350
applications of those protocols have not

321
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,480
been standardized yet there's a lot of

322
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,520
infighting a lot of different consortium

323
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,200
that are trying to drive the standards

324
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,110
there to repair independent direction

325
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,000
but there none of them have have come

326
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,830
together as one and said you know hey

327
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,690
let's just come up with a single

328
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,160
standard and let's go with it they just

329
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,750
they can't do that sounds like our

330
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,459
Congress almost right they just can't

331
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:02,260
get on the same page nation state

332
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,590
interest you knew there had to be a

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,700
slide about this one right so if you can

334
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:11,080
imagine if the malware writers are

335
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,490
interested in writing this and they're

336
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,550
writing these concepts and they're

337
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,320
writing these these these solutions that

338
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,189
are extensible that can use programming

339
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,280
languages and all these other things

340
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:24,130
it's not just to do the novel services

341
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,780
your honor right they're looking at some

342
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,880
of these malware writers are looking at

343
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,550
this as potentially an ability to do

344
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,250
false multiplication right or did use it

345
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,099
as a distraction to something else so if

346
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,230
I can take some of these very extensible

347
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,470
platforms like Reaper and I can take

348
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,720
them in build scripts into Reaper I can

349
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,430
detract from you actually seeing what

350
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm really after in critical

351
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,750
infrastructure particularly when the

352
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,000
environment is doing a lot of stuff if

353
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,330
you have no specific baseline of what

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,040
that is then I can come in there and fly

355
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,140
upon the radar and I could be completely

356
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,610
destroying your infrastructure and you

357
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,170
have no idea because you don't know what

358
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,890
the base miles you don't know what it's

359
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:08,650
supposed to look like so if I can do

360
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:11,410
that I can bet you that these four

361
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,930
particularly these bad guys or more than

362
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,760
interested in doing that and you know

363
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,469
where we may start seeing this

364
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,689
potentially if we are not seeing it

365
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:24,850
already power utilities water supplies

366
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:27,820
chemical plants refineries things that

367
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,510
could be used as a method of terrorism

368
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,370
Eva

369
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,370
so again just kind of keep that in mind

370
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,329
so now when I get to the threats and

371
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,860
critical infrastructure and control

372
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:44,660
systems individual slow the sensor the

373
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,760
good old sensor the sensor is kind of a

374
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,709
live blood so if you think about most

375
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,899
control systems the workhorse of any

376
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:54,969
control system you the PLC for the most

377
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:57,320
part in IOT and IOT that's not true

378
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,180
because again I am concerned about

379
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,220
lifting data I'm concerned about

380
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,829
extracting data from a machine of

381
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,050
process taking that data and then

382
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,540
sending it somewhere else so what is

383
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,880
actually capturing the data is the

384
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,500
sensor and that sensor is reading at

385
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,740
some sample rate and it's reading some

386
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,680
some tag off of your PLC off your

387
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,269
machine off your fab device whatever it

388
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,329
is taking that information in and

389
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:28,100
shipping and off into neither these are

390
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:30,979
also however the points of entry for

391
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,019
attackers these sensors can be anything

392
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,750
they can be anything from some sort of

393
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,910
embedded self-contained device with a

394
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,540
proprietary OS all the way up to

395
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,730
Raspberry Pi zord we know devices

396
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,880
pineapple devices anything that has

397
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,790
limited compute but has enough confused

398
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,250
to take data and send a that's really

399
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,889
the only real requirement most of them

400
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,019
do not have enough compute to be able to

401
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:00,769
house any kind of significant security

402
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:03,410
stack of any time there may be kind of

403
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,760
some ruby rudimentary things that you

404
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,799
can do to the proprietary operating

405
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,049
systems that are underneath them but by

406
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,030
and large they're they're pretty they're

407
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:12,559
pretty standard open compute devices for

408
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,629
the most part you can buy some larger or

409
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,579
doing no devices some larger raspberry

410
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,130
divides hard devices that can do some of

411
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,480
that stuff but for the most part people

412
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,130
are going with those types of systems

413
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:30,470
because they're low cost and they

414
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:33,230
they're purpose-built so control

415
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,690
feedback loop threats so for folks that

416
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,280
are not in control systems and not in

417
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,470
industrial space this may be a bit

418
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,789
nebulous while I'll go

419
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:47,480
so anytime you're building something

420
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:50,190
either have an open loop or closed look

421
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,710
if it's an open loop it means it moves

422
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,740
from one process to another without a

423
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:58,200
stop if it's closed loop it means it

424
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,620
completes one loop entirely and it stops

425
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,149
and then it starts something else that's

426
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,658
a difference pretty straightforward

427
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:09,479
right if I can interact with a

428
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:11,460
controller right if I can change that

429
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,769
control loop somehow if I can augment it

430
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,470
somehow if I can inject bad data into it

431
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:18,269
if I can augment or change the data

432
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,940
that's coming out of it I can

433
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:23,809
potentially change what the next stage

434
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,190
in automation is right

435
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,408
many of these sensors that are being

436
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,139
deployed for being deployed as part of

437
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,750
decision support where they're sampling

438
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:35,459
against known parameters known set

439
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,139
points right and they're taking that

440
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,679
information and they're saying okay I

441
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:42,840
need to adjust the speed rotation

442
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,240
temperature aperture whatever there is

443
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,580
of this process in order to bring this

444
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,919
back within tolerance if I start

445
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,439
altering those numbers right if I start

446
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:57,360
changing those things I am now impacting

447
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,250
that controller right so again it's

448
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,549
their sensors read data from and

449
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,320
sometimes supply data to controllers so

450
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:06,899
it's not only just reading data and

451
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,970
sending it out to the cloud sometimes

452
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:11,219
that feedback that comes back from the

453
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,899
cloud in enrichment comes back into the

454
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,299
sensor and subsequently back into

455
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:20,389
control to change to change parameters

456
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:23,309
other control processes bad data

457
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:26,639
potentially bad control ooh potentially

458
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:29,549
bad consequence consequences now I'm

459
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:32,129
gonna caveat that statement so in many

460
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,210
industries there are still manual

461
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:37,439
failsafe

462
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,990
right so for chemicals for rock refining

463
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,059
for pharmaceuticals there are still

464
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,309
manual fail-safes that won't stop

465
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,049
something like this they're also what

466
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,850
they call safety of fermentation systems

467
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:51,250
that will prevent it from going well

468
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:53,929
outside of balance however

469
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,559
there are also equal numbers of

470
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,390
industries that do not necessarily have

471
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,320
those fail-safes and I won't name any of

472
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,290
them because I don't want to scare the

473
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,990
hell out of anybody but there are places

474
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,030
where they simply do not have the

475
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,280
capacity because the the gear that's

476
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,770
being used simply does not have the

477
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,840
capability to do so and so when those

478
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,950
instance is something like this when the

479
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,740
bush when the business is constantly

480
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,210
pushing saying hey I need this data hey

481
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,790
I need this data I need to get this

482
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,830
real-time data you're gonna deliver the

483
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:28,520
real-time data but there may be some

484
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,169
consequences for doing that the risks to

485
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,300
data integrity from internet from

486
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,550
external attack or from a malicious

487
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,080
insider so something else to consider

488
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,210
here this doesn't necessarily have to be

489
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,678
somebody from outside reading be

490
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,690
somebody that's sitting that knows the

491
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,610
process really well they can inject into

492
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,890
it somehow and alter it or somehow

493
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:50,090
damage it or somehow damage what is

494
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:53,510
being produced in that process supply

495
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,250
chain threats so give me supply chain

496
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,990
experts in the room just by just my

497
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,880
chance to show hands I kind of figured

498
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,330
not but will will I just wanted to throw

499
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,340
that out there so interruption to the

500
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,110
control loop process from bad data or

501
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,360
denial of service against sensors can

502
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:13,629
result in product line disruptions

503
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,550
errors in manufacturing or batching

504
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,610
demand damaged defective components

505
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,149
logistics failures chain disruptions or

506
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,649
failure

507
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,290
okay so let's kind of let's touch on

508
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:26,420
each one of these quickly so product

509
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,280
line disruption so for any of you two

510
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,870
there have ever been an assembly line or

511
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,610
in a factory you have all these

512
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,590
different product lines right and each

513
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,000
part of it does something different if

514
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,649
you know you have something that steps

515
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,740
the board something that tests the board

516
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,559
and so on so cool if I can impact how

517
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,679
those things occur I can break the line

518
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,649
I break the line I calls a component to

519
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,540
either fail I calls a component to stamp

520
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,150
in the wrong place I calls that

521
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,710
component to catch on fire I call that

522
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,179
component to fly out of the machine I

523
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,890
can do a number of different things

524
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,450
right just depending on what it is I'm

525
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,720
impacting

526
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,520
here's a manufacturing and batching

527
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,250
where this is a huge deal isn't for

528
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,290
muscles right if I'm a pharmaceutical

529
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,380
company and I have an error in batching

530
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:14,000
I've dumped the whole batch right

531
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,100
because I don't know where the error

532
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,540
went where the error went wrong in the

533
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,100
batch and so if you think about

534
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,760
something like levitra say for instance

535
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,830
levitra costs were at about $80 appeal

536
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,100
produce and every batches of thousand

537
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,720
dollar or is a thousand field so if I

538
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,850
got a dump those batches because I'm

539
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,130
getting errant data that hits my bottom

540
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,149
line really really quickly and

541
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,990
somebody's known you're fired

542
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:41,810
more than likely damages are defective

543
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,370
components this is not uncommon even in

544
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,169
a in a normal situation where you have a

545
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,870
component that gets damaged just because

546
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,100
the production line shifts you know 2

547
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,250
centimeters to the right or to the left

548
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,870
but if I'm changing this if I'm the

549
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,690
impacting it by a feedback look when I'm

550
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,030
changing it I can make this thing

551
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,550
drop-offs order you know 10 feet away

552
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,810
from the board where it's supposed to go

553
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:06,610
right and the only time I'll know that

554
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:08,690
is when someone sees a big pile of metal

555
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,260
sitting on the conveyor belt is like

556
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,150
what the hell is that

557
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,670
logistics failures this one is actually

558
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,980
kind of interesting because producing

559
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,330
product is one thing shipping it and

560
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,540
getting it where it needs to be is quite

561
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:26,300
another right and interestingly enough

562
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,990
companies lose more money not in

563
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,300
production but deliver of getting things

564
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,540
where they need to be on time under

565
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:39,020
budget and on schedule and so if I can

566
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:41,149
impact that if I can say hey I'm sending

567
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,379
information back to a sensor that this

568
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,200
thing is already left but it's still

569
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,940
sitting the warehouse you know 15 days

570
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,160
later when the customers calling asking

571
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,200
whether he'll if my stuff and you're

572
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,910
like I shipped it 15 days ago and

573
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,090
they're like where did you ship it -

574
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:58,670
yeah problem right and it's not industry

575
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,800
sticking like oil and gas there are very

576
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:03,350
specific timelines associated with

577
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,810
product being delivered to a site to

578
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,580
drill a hole in the ground and so for

579
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,560
every day that that driller is sitting

580
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,970
that right that part it's hundreds of

581
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,590
thousands of dollars that that all

582
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,269
company is having to pay so guess who's

583
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,678
gonna happen

584
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:18,349
that manufacturer that didn't get that

585
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,229
part to them you know when they did so

586
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:23,779
again real-life implications just by

587
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:26,629
altering something really small and

588
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:28,220
really something at the end of course

589
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:30,439
change disruption or failure again the

590
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:34,179
entire manufacturing chain call us to go

591
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,710
offline cause it failed it's also

592
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:39,440
there's a caveat and a good note on here

593
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,109
where it says supply chain attacks will

594
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,940
continue to become more of a nuisance as

595
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:46,699
connectedness increases in critical

596
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,539
infrastructure so the more we connect

597
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,460
the smarter we get the more this is

598
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:55,129
going to become a problem alright and

599
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,679
it's and it seems kind of antithetical

600
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:59,779
right there you know as you you would

601
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,409
think as you get smarter this would

602
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:05,570
become less of an issue but the drive to

603
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:07,489
continue to gather data to gather more

604
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,609
more information to get more content

605
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:14,179
more and more and more about everything

606
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:16,129
is also enabling these types of attacks

607
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:19,099
and these types of impacts in these

608
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:22,879
environments so what we do

609
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:26,359
countermeasures and capabilities ask

610
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:29,509
that visibility pretty easy right can't

611
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,728
see it you can't fight it all right the

612
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:35,149
key to defending against any threat is

613
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:36,889
visibility protection of protection of

614
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,168
against IOT botnets and critical

615
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:41,539
infrastructure it's no different and

616
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,729
really truly it right you still talking

617
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:46,759
about something that's reaching out to

618
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:49,340
something else through some network

619
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,529
means of some sort it may be using a

620
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,109
proprietary protocol but it's still IP

621
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:56,690
transport almost one right so your

622
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:59,899
traditional types of controls will

623
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,669
generally work generally and I will will

624
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:05,149
vow asterisk that and I'll tell you why

625
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:06,889
that's general here in a moment it's

626
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:09,978
generally challenging to get accurate

627
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:14,678
asset inventories and IOT devices so if

628
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:18,549
you imagine you have a plant that's got

629
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:21,710
that covers several acres right that's

630
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:23,418
400 building and I'm looking for a

631
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:27,739
device to speak

632
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:32,119
right I'm looking for hundreds of

633
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:34,219
thousands of devices this vid and not

634
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,439
only am i looking for devices this big

635
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:38,570
in that type of facility but I'm also

636
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,440
looking for what they are actually

637
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:44,658
communicating with in a sea of

638
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,979
god-knows-what everything from all the

639
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,139
automation that's happening in the

640
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,940
environment to someone checking their

641
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,758
email to somebody checking for a recipe

642
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,849
to bake cookies all of this stuff is all

643
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:58,729
part of the same data ecosystem so

644
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:01,129
trying identify something this big in

645
00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:03,099
all that space there's a bit of a

646
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:05,809
challenge as you can imagine

647
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:07,668
additionally some of these devices do

648
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:09,499
not run a traditional operating system

649
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:14,450
they don't run a Windows or Linux they

650
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:17,570
run X and your tools may not have any

651
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,009
idea what X is may not have a look so

652
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,958
you see this on the wire you're like

653
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:22,969
okay I know that's not right but I don't

654
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:24,829
know what it is and so now you have try

655
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:28,459
to locate this thing inside of this big

656
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:30,168
plant that's this big so passive and

657
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:31,700
active methods can be levers to

658
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:36,829
understand topography and breadth of

659
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:38,299
threat service now there's a catch there

660
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:42,229
as always is right there's always a

661
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:45,469
catch in control system environments the

662
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:48,379
active part of this is of high debate

663
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:50,570
right as to how active you can actually

664
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:52,998
be in those environments and how

665
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,269
actively you can interrogate and pull

666
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:59,269
things in order to get information that

667
00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:02,389
in the case of a sensor when you are

668
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:04,639
pulling an active sensor you will

669
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:08,508
inevitably always force it to miss a

670
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:10,279
checkpoint almost always I have 90 count

671
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:12,619
I've worked with about 200 different

672
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,190
senses I've not encountered one that is

673
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,579
not true

674
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,249
and when it matters is if it is

675
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:21,649
providing feedback into some sort of

676
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:23,329
control loop or some sort of process if

677
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,678
all I'm doing is just receive reading

678
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:26,089
reading machine data and I'm getting

679
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,219
that and going to send it somewhere for

680
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:30,678
real-time analytics that's fine

681
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:34,069
but at the moment I'm using that sensor

682
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,229
data to re-inject into some sort of

683
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,629
control loop I can't have any bites in

684
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:39,090
it

685
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,800
because the system is responding right

686
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,050
based on the information that is getting

687
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,940
and so if I'm out here actively pulling

688
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,860
this thing right I'm out here running

689
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,270
this and VP against it or I'm out here

690
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,240
you know running some sort of missus can

691
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:53,610
I taking up the process of the limited

692
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,350
compute processing cycles that distance

693
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:59,340
or has in order to produce these

694
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:01,860
checkpoints so guess what now the system

695
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,659
that is getting this data he is now

696
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,389
doing something different because the

697
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:10,500
data is getting is there and so you end

698
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,120
up hurting yourself we're not one of

699
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,160
them of their unintentional consequences

700
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,739
right understand unintentional you know

701
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:20,400
I care so you have to be really careful

702
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:22,020
about actively scanning anything in any

703
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,680
control system but certainly we are

704
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,070
dealing with this constant defensive

705
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,500
death

706
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:32,730
again we've all heard this you know ad

707
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,620
nauseam IOT devices are relatively low

708
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,420
key Colo computers so again to get back

709
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,580
to what we were talking about how small

710
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,440
some of these things can be right and

711
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,050
they're attached to these machines

712
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,350
typically they may or may not have their

713
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,940
own independent network connectivity

714
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,250
they may be Wireless they may not be

715
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,910
Wireless they may be GSM they may be

716
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,320
five genes you have nowhere no right if

717
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,630
you're not walking around with some sort

718
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,820
of spectrum analyzer right you don't

719
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,530
know what isn't absolutely coming off in

720
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,110
these devices always sending that data

721
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,910
to unless someone says hey there's a

722
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,070
device right there what an antenna on it

723
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:12,090
talking gsm and it's sending data to

724
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:13,379
here right which is what's very it will

725
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,909
which never happens

726
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,370
I can I can tell you from experience

727
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:21,210
I've never had a single user come with

728
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:23,280
me and tell me that ever but when you're

729
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,590
designing your defense and their

730
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,030
strategies you have to have some general

731
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,409
understanding of where this data is

732
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,620
coming from and where it's trying to go

733
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,300
and how sensitive is how valuable is it

734
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,149
to the people that are trying to get it

735
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,460
in point A to point B if it's just nice

736
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,980
to have it's just okay if we guess

737
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,610
they're great did you protect it as if

738
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,100
it's it's okay and okay great if it is

739
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,908
something that is in decision support

740
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,279
you got to protect it like it's the

741
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:53,349
to you right because your job and

742
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,129
particularly your life really does

743
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:58,960
depend on it

744
00:30:54,129 --> 00:31:01,719
right because of the diversity of IOT

745
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,729
sensors a layered security posture is

746
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,299
key to managing the threat service so

747
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:07,899
again these devices can be all over your

748
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:10,658
mouth

749
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:13,029
and typically are and you may not have

750
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:15,899
any way of knowing if you are

751
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:18,549
responsible for monitoring a refinery

752
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:21,928
monitoring a chemical plant these

753
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:25,210
sensors are literally everywhere and

754
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:28,539
unless you have specifically said thou

755
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:30,609
shalt not put these on the wire and thou

756
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,710
shalt not send data out of it

757
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:35,699
they will because they'll hook it up and

758
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:38,169
be like ooh there's some cool data here

759
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,940
who I need to cook up a novel oh I

760
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:41,649
wonder if this machine can do it too and

761
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,570
so before long you have a thousand

762
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,609
sensors sitting or you get that work and

763
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,379
each one of them is sending data to

764
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,119
god-knows-where

765
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:51,668
so you have to look at things like you

766
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,009
have to have an IOT program and a

767
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:56,229
strategy right I know it's that no

768
00:31:54,009 --> 00:32:00,849
that's you know that's high expectations

769
00:31:56,229 --> 00:32:02,529
but you do you take a gateway and you

770
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:05,710
sit all of these sensors behind that

771
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:09,190
gateway so you now have one place what

772
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,769
all this stuff is going if anything goes

773
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,119
awry with that data you can go to that

774
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:15,609
gateway and say okay

775
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,869
what's going on here right you can look

776
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,779
at the law shouldn't have it part of

777
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:22,090
your overall as a net response plan

778
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:23,799
detecting response you can't do that

779
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,499
you've got 10,000 sensors going to the

780
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,389
Internet at one time the net you you

781
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:30,879
there is not there not enough people and

782
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:33,129
are not enough pool owner to be able to

783
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:34,629
get through that right so just kind of

784
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:36,279
you know as you're deploying these

785
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:38,408
things and certainly as you're you're

786
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:40,599
evaluating your own environments for IOT

787
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:43,749
or IOT usage let's kind of think about

788
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:46,269
that that you need a choke point or a

789
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:47,919
couple at least you know as opposed to

790
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:51,629
just having like 20,000 devices more

791
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,629
straight than Internet not so much

792
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:58,409
Monica

793
00:32:53,870 --> 00:33:00,389
so for this one you know all the times

794
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,950
we'll do a really good job right we'll

795
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,930
have it all set up everything will be

796
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,120
great it'll be all pretty in Iraq we'll

797
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,780
take pictures of it you know Wilma take

798
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,020
selfies with it do all this stuff right

799
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:15,300
and then the data goes no way

800
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,240
what a day to go somewhere but new

801
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:21,120
windows wake up right no one knows what

802
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,400
is actually happening to this data it's

803
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,629
part of what we care about right because

804
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,120
there's two different avenues that we

805
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,310
care about we care about the data itself

806
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,050
sir well we care about what information

807
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,169
is going to what cloud providers also

808
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:36,899
for but we also care about if something

809
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:39,240
is happening in that ecosystem I didn't

810
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:43,230
know right as somebody it's altering

811
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,900
that ecosystem you know that part all

812
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,640
the time get slipped up you know because

813
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,610
that aggregation is not always

814
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,650
aggravated at a single point it may be

815
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,750
that 20,000 senses want the wire and so

816
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:56,550
now you're talking about taking 20,000

817
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,560
individual systems and somehow figuring

818
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,310
out how to get a log data off of

819
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:05,730
something that's bit in a factory tidbit

820
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:07,590
not gonna happen right so detecting

821
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,360
their denial of service attack requires

822
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,810
monitoring their sensors so in order to

823
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,149
see this stuff you got to be monitoring

824
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:17,399
right because in many cases these denial

825
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:19,520
of service attacks because your compute

826
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,500
cycles or so low on these devices

827
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,879
you didn't take much right it's not a

828
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,918
lot of traffic so you're not gonna see

829
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,509
Oh God you know the entire internet it

830
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,969
raining down on my site what'd you ever

831
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:33,210
see what you're gonna see he is these

832
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:34,500
sensors over time trending upward and

833
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,060
they may trend up there were a little

834
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,239
bit at a time if it's something like

835
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,009
Reaper eaten they take a really really

836
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:45,989
long time cause it's really really slick

837
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:48,510
and use a cycle use a cycle use a cycle

838
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:49,918
well that could be the sensor right so

839
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,870
if you're analyzing that that could just

840
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,819
be the sensor that could be its normal

841
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,739
behavior if you have no monitoring you

842
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,149
have no continuous monitoring of it

843
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,779
you don't want with the normal behavior

844
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:02,310
is so it's just kind of some of those

845
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,290
things again if you think about

846
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,500
contextual awareness within the

847
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:12,730
monitoring

848
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:16,119
what's normal what it last part it is

849
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:19,359
monitoring must trend providing baseline

850
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:21,099
and anomaly visibility and be robust

851
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,440
enough to support detection and response

852
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,930
needs there's no reason to set up

853
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,930
monitoring and all that if you're not in

854
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,430
do anything with there there's no that's

855
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:35,680
a complete waste of your time and your

856
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:38,859
money to go do that so let's bring it

857
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,029
all together don't bring it home because

858
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:43,690
I know that out the hall is calling

859
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:45,270
everybody I know it's calling me to find

860
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:49,270
the words

861
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:51,130
Mourad who's only the beginning of it so

862
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,480
let us not kid ourselves into thinking

863
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,800
well that's the worst that's the bad

864
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,130
that's worth we can see that's the worst

865
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,119
is gonna ever be I assure you it it

866
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,119
we're just getting started with us

867
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,490
through critical infrastructure as these

868
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:15,490
environments become smarter so again as

869
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:17,979
we get smarter in these environments and

870
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,479
get more connected and we spend a whole

871
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,359
bunch of time patting ourselves on back

872
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,329
on our backs on how smart we are we are

873
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:27,310
inverted ly also increasing the threat

874
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:29,380
surface and then the threats against

875
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,410
these environments almost exponentially

876
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:36,640
as fast as we learn sort of the bad guys

877
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:44,009
and there's a lot more of them than us

878
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:47,259
right we are seeing increasingly complex

879
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:49,839
powerful and robust capabilities that

880
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,720
require relatively low technical skill

881
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,779
to execute these are not difficult

882
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,640
exports folks these they're not

883
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,460
difficult all many of these many of

884
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,190
these exploits or simple exploits that

885
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,859
have been around for years but because I

886
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:09,060
have limited surface on these assets I

887
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:12,960
have limited capabilities

888
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:16,380
I'd have to use stripped-down browsers I

889
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,710
have to used you know whatever memory

890
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,650
registers available for somebody that's

891
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,600
just a basic script Kinney that's like

892
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,310
the Holy Grail I don't have to do

893
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,830
anything all I do is go download that

894
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,940
around and walk away and then low and

895
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,310
behold I got something

896
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,900
well lo and behold I'm now you know

897
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:39,900
watching a denial-of-service attack to

898
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:42,060
get Krebs online nation-state

899
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,640
observation of these techniques should

900
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,930
have everybody concerned he we are not

901
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,170
concerned if we're not thinking about

902
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:52,649
whether or not North Korea and Russia

903
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:55,350
and China and Iran invited for Iran

904
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,110
right with who we're picking a fight

905
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:00,750
with at the moment you think they're not

906
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,860
looking at this kind of stuff trying to

907
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,510
figure out okay you know what I almost

908
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,750
sticking to the US I got I got some

909
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:11,130
footman you know we're not prepared for

910
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:15,840
this in no format we are we are not

911
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:22,410
prepared for this type of skill give to

912
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:24,930
all right visibility defense in depth

913
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:28,440
monitoring all necessary to reduce the

914
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:30,690
attack surface created by it is a

915
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,850
concerted effort of all of these

916
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,650
different capabilities that is going to

917
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:37,620
give you a fighting chance to be able to

918
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:41,010
help combat some of the stuff one of

919
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:44,880
these is not sufficient it's required

920
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:46,820
what's not sufficient and the last thing

921
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,880
that I told you I would leave you will

922
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:55,760
consider how much more smart can we take

923
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,620
how much smarter can we get can't

924
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,880
actually keep up with it and actually

925
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:30,200
still be defensive with that I hand it

926
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:31,640
back any questions yes sir okay so we'll

927
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:38,089
pull my professional professional hat

928
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:41,330
off for a minute probably about 95% of

929
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:45,920
these components or made in China policy

930
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:48,350
right we had a particular issue that I

931
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,750
mean if anyone follow you the hay way

932
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,310
stuff like with all highway stuff with

933
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:56,690
the with the phone cell phones and all

934
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:59,810
that business so how it makes components

935
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,830
for mini mini cell phones right ones

936
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,620
that we sell here in the United States

937
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:07,600
and we've had some we've had some supply

938
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:10,580
chain challenges with Haley right

939
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,500
so the questions you have to ask

940
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,840
yourself and we remember I mentioned

941
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:19,190
about that we're not prepared for this

942
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:22,700
really this is why we don't control the

943
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:25,100
supply chain for these cursory parts and

944
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,859
so because we don't so we don't control

945
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,870
the supply chain for them we could in

946
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,190
every we could invariably as we're on

947
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:34,730
this track to be the smartest in the

948
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:38,600
room be setting ourselves up for the

949
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:41,860
most massive denial of service attack on

950
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,960
earth this is a distinct possibility

951
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:47,030
right because I will tell you that the

952
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,410
type of analysis that would need to be

953
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:52,820
done is at the micron level to be able

954
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,670
to determine whether or not these

955
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,410
sensors have been impacted or have low

956
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,420
level sensor code or anything or

957
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,220
embedded code in them that would cause

958
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,620
them at some data in the future to

959
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,089
spontaneously combust orders I'm dating

960
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:09,029
the computer to release whatever

961
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:11,400
is that they're trying to to manage to

962
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,200
shut those set that down or to speed

963
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,770
that up or to slow it down or to change

964
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,410
it there's no way of knowing you have no

965
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,000
way of knowing that so I mean you know

966
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,779
so no you may go you bring up an

967
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,680
excellent point

968
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:29,550
and from you know from a practitioners

969
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,169
perspective we can only do the best we

970
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:34,140
can do all right

971
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,640
it is a mitigated it is a mitigated but

972
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,180
understood artists it is an understood

973
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:42,240
risk right and because it's an

974
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,910
understood risk we cannot quantify or

975
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,479
qualify that risk relative to the cost

976
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:50,370
and benefit of moving forward and so

977
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,120
companies are not going to sit still

978
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:56,759
because these came out of China right

979
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,920
they're not from our perspective we're

980
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,600
thinking will the damn supply chain is

981
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,000
in China something it's one of those

982
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,529
four did hate us right and we're picking

983
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,760
fights with them constantly every day

984
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:14,520
around nonsense so you know I don't have

985
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,890
a good answer for that but I can tell

986
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:34,920
you that yes usually it is certainly a

987
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:36,509
primary concern yes sir addressing the

988
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,570
challenge with the supply chain itself

989
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:44,670
um you know to the extent that they can

990
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:46,470
right so if I buy a sensor right it's

991
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,660
usually self contained inside of

992
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,089
something else very very rarely do you

993
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,370
buy a raw sensor right it's part of some

994
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,230
other unit that's linked into something

995
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,450
else so say first you go with like a

996
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:00,180
light Teledyne or you go with siemens

997
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:03,299
even right the sensors that they have

998
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,460
have parts that are from China you know

999
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,770
it may be manufactured in Germany right

1000
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,440
it still parts the the semiconductor

1001
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,210
business is really big in Taiwan is huge

1002
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,740
in Taiwan in Singapore and Indonesia

1003
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:19,920
that part world so I mean

1004
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,618
at any point in that supply chain you

1005
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,109
could have an impacted component being

1006
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,780
introduced into these commercial sensors

1007
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:29,700
absolutely you could now from the

1008
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,230
standpoint of a chevron or some of these

1009
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,598
large companies whether or not they can

1010
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,839
actually do anything about it not really

1011
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,410
I mean there's not there's not a lot of

1012
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,450
outside of testing it and again you're

1013
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,420
testing for function right you're

1014
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:47,189
testing for function of the unit it's

1015
00:43:45,420 --> 00:44:03,660
not an individual component within the

1016
00:43:47,190 --> 00:44:05,910
EM so not really right and I mean and

1017
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,240
again I mean you I mean you could test

1018
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:11,040
ad nauseam right most of the times in

1019
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,810
you know for any you guys that do kind

1020
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,369
of malware like marrow where analysis or

1021
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,599
any kind of resilience testing and

1022
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:17,099
things like that you know that it's only

1023
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,530
a certain set of conditions that will

1024
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,060
call something to be able certainly so

1025
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,010
not only do you have to guess the

1026
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:27,119
component but you have to guess the

1027
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:30,150
condition that could be millions of

1028
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,420
different permutations right so you you

1029
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:35,730
there's only so much safety that you can

1030
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,589
have when you're doing this but it's

1031
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:41,510
certainly something that you as a

1032
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:41,509
practitioner need to be aware of and be

1033
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:10,319
accepting that there

1034
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,989
[Music]

1035
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:30,029
you know but they are useful you told my

1036
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:32,219
they're getting it so I will tell you

1037
00:45:30,029 --> 00:45:33,869
what you just described is the actual I

1038
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:36,959
think the exact opposite of where

1039
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:39,689
businesses are headed right so there was

1040
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:41,939
a time where these network more

1041
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:43,769
connected at all in any capacity and I

1042
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,479
deal with each other they were there was

1043
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:48,629
a serial cable he could that plugged

1044
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:50,089
into something and that was that once

1045
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,849
they were ill I wants the business

1046
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:56,219
realized that you could get data off of

1047
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,630
this stuff and this whole Six Sigma and

1048
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:02,249
being lean and all this other nonsense

1049
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:04,140
came about now all of a sudden who we

1050
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:05,999
want to get this machine data and we

1051
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,739
want to squeeze every ounce of

1052
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:09,629
productivity we can out of this machine

1053
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:12,479
that we just spent ten million dollars

1054
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,429
on and the only way they can do that is

1055
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,899
by getting data and continuous

1056
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:19,109
improvement continuous monitoring it's

1057
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:22,319
the only way they can do that because of

1058
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:25,319
that that data has to be made available

1059
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,390
to something that is not at the control

1060
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:29,669
site on the control network right it

1061
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:33,150
there's there's nothing there there's no

1062
00:46:29,669 --> 00:46:37,129
one there that cares right they care

1063
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:39,839
about is it running I put in precursor a

1064
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,369
the product be come up have the five

1065
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,369
right that's what they're concerned

1066
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:46,589
about because I kind of measure right

1067
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:48,059
but someone up in the company somewhere

1068
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:51,659
is interested in looking at the

1069
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:54,329
individual V and saying hey if we move

1070
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:56,279
this machine two centimeters closer then

1071
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:58,169
we can get 10 more units out of the day

1072
00:46:56,279 --> 00:47:00,569
and so someone is going that type of

1073
00:46:58,169 --> 00:47:02,819
analysis right and so what as long as

1074
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:04,650
that's occurring and now you're starting

1075
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:06,869
to see more and more interaction with

1076
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,819
the cloud so a lot of this data that is

1077
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:10,559
coming out of these environments is

1078
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:12,419
being sent up in the clouds like vimana

1079
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,069
or in the smart shop and some of these

1080
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:16,158
other entities and it being being

1081
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:19,709
permuting and transforming enriched

1082
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:22,250
mobilized and taking that data and then

1083
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:25,190
sending that data back down into

1084
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:28,430
the control environments either for

1085
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:30,200
introduction into control itself or to a

1086
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,149
control engineer or a process engineer

1087
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,770
or operator to be able to take that data

1088
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,940
and make some sort of change and

1089
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:40,310
adjustment for optimization purposes so

1090
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:43,700
in some places air gasping actually

1091
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:45,980
works as long as you don't need the data

1092
00:47:43,700 --> 00:48:07,730
from right if only thing you need to do

1093
00:47:45,980 --> 00:48:10,369
is operate you can have you can you

1094
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:12,859
certainly can so keep in mind that this

1095
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:15,740
sensor data it looks a lot more like IT

1096
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:17,330
data then it does manufacturing data so

1097
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,160
you're not gonna see Modbus sitting in

1098
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,200
it you're not gonna see Pokemon I've

1099
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,930
seen that kind of stuff it's gonna be

1100
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,609
primarily coordinate and so it's gonna

1101
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:28,220
be a straight in this long and it's

1102
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:30,470
gonna be numbers with commas right and

1103
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,419
then something's gonna ingest that right

1104
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,200
I mean I'm I'm just did I mean that's

1105
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,550
what you're gonna see you know see a

1106
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,640
string of data about yay long and

1107
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:40,130
numbers and coordinates and that's going

1108
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,839
to mean something to something right

1109
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,400
it's gonna mean something to some form

1110
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,799
some form of analytic they're sitting in

1111
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,080
the cloud normally that's taking that

1112
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:51,380
machine data that it's getting and

1113
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,690
actually formulating business value

1114
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,670
there's some sort of Business Objects

1115
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,470
into what that machine is actually know

1116
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,180
so from the standpoint of whether you

1117
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,740
continue to air-gap it's really more of

1118
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:04,460
a business decision about whether they

1119
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:06,649
continue to do that and certain

1120
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,030
industries it's kind of their standard

1121
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:13,010
as to how they operate and how they

1122
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:15,800
function but invertible very few

1123
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:18,440
environments stay that way right because

1124
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,910
at some point someone's gonna go plug

1125
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,440
something in because they're gonna need

1126
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,149
something off of one of these machines

1127
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,830
even from an operational perspective

1128
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,270
right they're gonna take their laptop

1129
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,160
and they're gonna walk in they're gonna

1130
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:30,500
plug the about a dated out you're gonna

1131
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,000
plug it in behind something and that

1132
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,280
machine is gonna still be sitting on the

1133
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,400
corporate network and wireless somewhere

1134
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,080
so there's this notion of a perfect a

1135
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,440
gap I'd be really suspect to that

1136
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:45,500
whenever people say it there are

1137
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,030
attempts right do it does it does it is

1138
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,450
there value to keep their you know

1139
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:52,070
they'll keep the data separate it's

1140
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:54,049
really more weight over individual

1141
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,040
design decision based on your site and

1142
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,260
the industry that you're working with

1143
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,150
some in some industries you have to find

1144
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,950
in some industries you have to keep

1145
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:03,290
certain types of data away from other

1146
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:06,439
types of a so if it's regulated its

1147
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:22,400
regulated it way you got good answer

1148
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:24,070
your question okay so in order to have

1149
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,119
regulation you have to have standards

1150
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:28,190
right you have to have a unified

1151
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:33,500
standard of some sort to base that

1152
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:35,450
regulation off of so I'm gonna step on

1153
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:40,070
put one toe one toe my soapbox for a

1154
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:44,509
minute our Congress can't do like basic

1155
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:46,640
things right so you're telling me you

1156
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:49,640
want our Congress here in the United

1157
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,368
States to come up with legislation to

1158
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,410
dictate what our team looks like do you

1159
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:56,990
really want them to do it I mean

1160
00:50:54,410 --> 00:51:06,049
honestly I mean do you do you really

1161
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:09,109
want them to go now on that path if I'm

1162
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:10,390
a company and I'm selling unit said unit

1163
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:12,950
at fifteen cents a unit

1164
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:15,859
the last thing I'm about to do is stack

1165
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,210
some regulations on top of that cuz it

1166
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:19,009
now I'm gonna have to say anything at a

1167
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,500
dollar unit to deal with though it

1168
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:25,369
Nannette you know that whole self

1169
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:28,609
regulation thing you know but you know

1170
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:31,420
so so Congress is supposedly is trying

1171
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:35,060
right I've seen some evidence that

1172
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:37,130
they're trying to wrap some sanity

1173
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:40,310
around kind of our psycho posture and

1174
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:44,510
all this other stuff but again in a lab

1175
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:47,940
the lack of a unified standard

1176
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:51,540
now at some levels it and again with I

1177
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:54,830
with the Congress that we got now now

1178
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,830
I'm gonna take my foot off this soapbox

1179
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:13,920
anything else yes sir oh yeah over the

1180
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:16,500
privacy policy yeah well so the average

1181
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,710
consumer right has no concept of the

1182
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:23,370
fact that a generator sitting in a power

1183
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:25,590
plant has thousands of sensors on it and

1184
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:30,000
it's sending thousands of elements of

1185
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:32,160
data to something that is in either no

1186
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,630
one done up regular folk don't know what

1187
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,490
you think about that nobody cared

1188
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,650
all they know is I walk in my house and

1189
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:39,479
I turn the lights on make them up or I

1190
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:42,630
go to water speaking and turn the water

1191
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,640
on it comes off is it they don't they

1192
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,880
have no concept of what all that other

1193
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:51,270
stuff effected and so but they do know

1194
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:55,280
what a Fitbit is right you know they do

1195
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:59,790
know what and iPad is or an iPhone right

1196
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:02,220
well all these are right although the

1197
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:04,620
wearables getting wearable anything

1198
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,899
that's protecting your heart light these

1199
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:09,660
are all IOT devices they care about that

1200
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,600
well I think you can't try you can't

1201
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,460
have my Fitbit name well they're not so

1202
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:18,330
concerned about you know the sensor data

1203
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,710
coming off their power generation you

1204
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:24,240
know I'm not sure I would be either if

1205
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:29,330
I'm wearing in I'd care less anything

1206
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,330
else thank you very much

1207
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:36,830
