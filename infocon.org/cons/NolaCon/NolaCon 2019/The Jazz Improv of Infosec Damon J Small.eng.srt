being the higher people all right

54
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,359
so because of the OS en't challenge I

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,140
think some of you in this room know a

56
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:36,250
little bit about me but that's me

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,358
credit to the picture goes to Eli Owen

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,000
photography he took that at Def Con last

59
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:43,220
year so I studied music initially at

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,690
Louisiana State in Baton Rouge any LSU

61
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,849
fans go Tigers hey okay good all right

62
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,609
then figured out that in the music

63
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,709
industry 1% of people make 99% of the

64
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:59,329
money and then I just fell into computer

65
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:02,569
science and 23 years later Here I am so

66
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:04,430
that's a little bit about me okay let's

67
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,230
get into the story so where did this

68
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,930
come from so I already mentioned that I

69
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,649
used to be a gigging musician and in

70
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,510
jazz particularly you know you hopefully

71
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,790
your ensemble starts and stops in the

72
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,319
same place but you spend a lot of time

73
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,849
thinking on your feet and as a

74
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,418
consultant now for the last several

75
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:25,149
years I realized that that that skill of

76
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:28,940
improvisation has actually helped me

77
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,470
quite a bit and I'm not going to read my

78
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,760
abstract to you that that was just there

79
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,000
to help me remember what I'm talking

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,608
about today in information security

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,510
whether you're doing InfoSec for your

82
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,889
organization or you're a consultant that

83
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,290
thinking on your feet that improvisation

84
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,940
actually turns out to be very very

85
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,310
useful so let me just quickly pull the

86
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,310
room how many of you are consultants of

87
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,069
some sort all right there's a handful

88
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,489
that's okay and the rest of you

89
00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:02,690
presumably do InfoSec for your organ

90
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:04,250
yeah who would hire you yeah so that's

91
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,690
where this story came from so now I'm

92
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,690
gonna walk you through hopefully some

93
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,940
specific examples too and if nothing

94
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,879
else if it makes you think about you

95
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,560
know how to be more effective as an

96
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,409
information security professional than I

97
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,978
think I will have done my job so let me

98
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:24,110
talk about setting up this allegory here

99
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:26,688
of improvisation

100
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,759
in jazz gauge so the sheet music is kind

101
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,740
of like the statement of work and I'll

102
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,330
show you an example in a second so that

103
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,509
tells you you know what you're supposed

104
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,430
to be doing and again it you know the in

105
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,729
goal is to start and stop that at the

106
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,310
same time so as it turns out that what

107
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,900
is on the page whether it's the sheet of

108
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,759
music or the statement of work is not

109
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,448
necessarily what the client or the

110
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,240
audience actually wants the musician has

111
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:55,310
to read the crowd like I'm doing now if

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,870
I start seeing people falling asleep and

113
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,469
I know I've got to do something out my

114
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:04,789
wife has already yeah yeah she's heard

115
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:07,370
this before so specific examples of how

116
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:11,259
we had to adapt to a changing audience

117
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:14,060
in front of us when I was in undergrad I

118
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,440
played in a band selected when I was

119
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,539
still in high school yeah we were hired

120
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,969
to do a wedding reception and we played

121
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:22,400
Louie Louie at some point because it's

122
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:24,560
an easy song and people recognize it

123
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,659
so we played it and you're like okay

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,509
thank goodness that's over and then the

125
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,550
bridesmaids decided that they could sing

126
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:33,469
it and make it better than just the

127
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,990
instrumental version we did play it

128
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:37,430
again like whatever as long as we get

129
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,639
paid at the end of the night well so we

130
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,400
played it again and the bridesmaids did

131
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,440
a horrible job I'm singing it well then

132
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,870
the groomsmen not to be one-upped

133
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,729
decided that they could do better than

134
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,770
the bridesmaids did so they came up and

135
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,719
said play it again and I was sitting

136
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,909
there behind the kid I'm the drummer and

137
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,460
thinking okay when they talk about

138
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:00,319
paying your dues this is what they were

139
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,388
talking about because going through that

140
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,539
song one time is bad enough and so we

141
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:09,110
played it a third time and but that's

142
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:10,699
what they wanted so that's what we did

143
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,440
as on the side at the end of the night

144
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,529
we're sitting there waiting on getting

145
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,770
paid and we hadn't packed up yet by the

146
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:19,219
way

147
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,560
gigging musicians we pay we play for

148
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:24,259
free we get paid for setup and teardown

149
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,969
that's the way it works so I'm sitting

150
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,159
there waiting on my money and all of a

151
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:31,069
sudden my drumset comes alive and like

152
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,589
huh I'm the drummer and I'm not over

153
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:36,529
there what the hell's going on and it

154
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:37,940
was the newly married young lady was

155
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,820
behind mic it

156
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,530
and that's so into it paying your dues

157
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,810
there was another time where we were

158
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,330
playing at a Blues bar and the bass

159
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,890
player we are playing a swing tune and

160
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,300
right in the middle of the tune he

161
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,580
decided that this would be more

162
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,700
interesting if it was a Samba instead of

163
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,950
a swing song so the drummer is if you're

164
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,080
a right handed drummer bass players

165
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,180
usually on your left and so I'm sitting

166
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,300
there swinging and he said hey let's

167
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,440
come around Samba like okay whatever is

168
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,070
clever so we just went into a Samba

169
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,420
because we thought that would be

170
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,520
interesting of course the horn section

171
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,350
in front of us you know had no idea what

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,200
was going on there like okay apparently

173
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,300
this is a Latin song now but it worked

174
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,820
out and because we were all used to

175
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,490
improvisation we changed without

176
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,590
communicating with the whole group and

177
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,240
it worked out so when I talk about if

178
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,310
you're not a musician yourself and

179
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,970
you're wondering what does Improv really

180
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,410
mean those are two examples when also

181
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,810
we're going to talk about silence in a

182
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,700
minute

183
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,070
silence can be terrifying

184
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,530
like for example as a public speaker if

185
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:50,210
I decide to stop talking for a minute

186
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:53,239
right right

187
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,760
but silence can as a consultant can can

188
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,270
be a useful technique and we'll talk

189
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,789
about that okay so what does let's make

190
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,200
it a little more technical what does

191
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,150
improvisation actually look like does

192
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,300
anyone know how to read music in here

193
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,409
okay Wow it's okay I shouldn't be

194
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,950
surprised because there's so many

195
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:16,580
creative people in computer science so

196
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:21,610
here's a chart sheet music and there's a

197
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:26,479
lot of information on the chart so

198
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:29,300
actually one sharp so that's G major F

199
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,820
sharp so in treble clef this is in G

200
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,469
major it tells us what notes we're going

201
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,130
to play it tells us the lyrics that go

202
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,080
along with it

203
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,229
all the information we possibly need

204
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,830
about playing this tune is on that piece

205
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:50,690
of paper all right now if you're the

206
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:51,940
drummer what do you get yeah so you see

207
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,440
this oh I forgot

208
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,090
I got bored last night so I put in

209
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,390
animations oof look at that are you

210
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,080
impressed see that say that's the

211
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,640
correct answer

212
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,710
see that section right there I've got a

213
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,050
bunch of bars and they've got little

214
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,370
slashes in them and you probably can't

215
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,479
read it but at the top there are some

216
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,800
words that says Dixieland beat other

217
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,810
than that you're so if you're the

218
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,189
drummer you're like alright I guess I'll

219
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,410
just play whatever the hell I want to

220
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,480
because they're you know by the time you

221
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,400
get to the rhythm section the composer

222
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,130
is probably bored and doesn't want to

223
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,600
have to describe exactly so in terms of

224
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,340
improvisation you know you have to

225
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,720
select a well I know where I'm starting

226
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,880
I know where I'm stopping other than

227
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,860
that it's up to me so that's the this

228
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,080
will make stay with me this will make

229
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,270
sense in a minute all right so what's

230
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,360
improvisation look like if you're an

231
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:48,520
InfoSec person so we had a client who

232
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,470
hired us every single year to do a an

233
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,120
annual assessment of part of their

234
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,280
environment it was the same bloody gig

235
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,590
every year and you would think that you

236
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,720
know over time the idea is we find stuff

237
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,560
then you go fix it and then we'll go

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,300
find different stuff well if you work in

239
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,219
InfoSec you know sometimes it can take a

240
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,959
really long time to fix problems you

241
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,990
know it's not like you just say oh right

242
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,150
click button and now problems or so so

243
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,510
we're basically giving them the same

244
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,459
report year after year and so we decided

245
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,680
1 years like this is not really

246
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,420
providing value so we know what the

247
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,270
statement of work says but let's do

248
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,099
something completely different and maybe

249
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,290
give them some other things to think

250
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,830
about in terms of the security posture

251
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:35,110
of their network so what we did is we

252
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,490
were you know you enumerate a network

253
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,970
right so we're scanning all the things

254
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,380
and we found all these Apple TVs that we

255
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,480
were in a conference room that a big

256
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,400
beautiful screen you're like wow there's

257
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,660
all these Apple TVs that's interesting I

258
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,280
want I wonder where they are

259
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,199
like where are they physically located

260
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,839
so we started looking around and there

261
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,890
was a cabinet that was unlocked and we

262
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,170
opened it up and of equipment including

263
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,000
the Apple TV that we found and all these

264
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,560
available Ethernet ports that were in

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,240
there and we're like on the other

266
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,060
internet ports by the way were protected

267
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,100
with with Mac

268
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,439
network access control so we couldn't

269
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,820
really quickly do anything with those

270
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,550
because we didn't have access to the

271
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,050
certificate to get on but we saw this AV

272
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,329
stuff from right now don't mind if we do

273
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,280
so plugged in and sure enough we get an

274
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,710
IP stack and we have access to

275
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,170
everything and so that was the first

276
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,210
place that we instrumented our attack

277
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,040
scenario was from their AV so they had

278
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,310
protected the business network quite

279
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:37,540
well but for whatever reason the AV

280
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,369
stuff was not protected at all so it was

281
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,410
just because we said okay we don't care

282
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,850
what the statement of work says we're

283
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,790
gonna do something different to try and

284
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,420
help our client be better and that's

285
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,420
that's how we did it

286
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,810
there was another gig where we were

287
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,640
having a really hard time finding

288
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,589
anything useful and you know we're not

289
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,540
paid consultants are not paid by the

290
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,720
finding right so I mean if a client's

291
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,280
environment is properly protected and

292
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,120
that's good that you know then you let

293
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,400
them know hey good job but you know

294
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,250
again neck wasn't play and every time we

295
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,750
plug in we couldn't get an IP stack

296
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,990
because like I said we didn't have this

297
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:23,290
supplement but we managed to gain access

298
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,840
to a an authorized device a company

299
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,630
laptop because someone left it on their

300
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,630
desk and that was in scope so we thank

301
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:34,390
you stole the laptop and plugged it into

302
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,280
the port and sure enough the supplicate

303
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,650
if you know how NAT works I mean so it

304
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,180
makes a broadcast and says here's this

305
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,860
certificate please let me on the network

306
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,260
and then some routing and switching

307
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,450
device heats up the port and then you

308
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,810
get access so we thought I wonder what

309
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,060
happens if we plug in a switch first and

310
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,430
then plug in the authorized device so

311
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,650
the port heated up we had access did we

312
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,359
plug in our unauthorized device and as

313
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,760
it turns out the way they had Mac

314
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,650
configured in their environment is it

315
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,410
would only check for the supplicant one

316
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,750
time the first time it plugs in it says

317
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,240
oh yeah this is a good device here's

318
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,430
your Ethernet port and so even after we

319
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,160
unplugged the authorized device the

320
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,859
unauthorized device continued having

321
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,360
network access and then we were able to

322
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,620
instrument the test from that

323
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,660
network access control port and it

324
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,220
became wildly successful but that was

325
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,019
only because in our frustration we

326
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,589
thought okay we need to be doing

327
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:36,130
something different so that's my other

328
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:39,190
example of improvisation right so

329
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,709
silence and music so it does anyone like

330
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,930
the symphony classical music so if you

331
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:46,630
listen to a multiple multiple movement

332
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,430
piece all the movements are part of one

333
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,070
piece and you're not supposed to clap in

334
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,810
between movements right so when I was

335
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,640
studying music at LSU it would drive me

336
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,680
nuts when people would start clapping

337
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,120
after the first movement and like can

338
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,729
you not read the program there's three

339
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,010
other movements in this thing so it can

340
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,440
be terrifying but the the reason I bring

341
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,810
it up is because again whether you're a

342
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,700
client facing consultant consultant or

343
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:13,060
you're doing information security for

344
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,470
your organization you you have you still

345
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,750
have clients you're supporting a

346
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,880
business unit somewhere by doing what

347
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:23,829
you're doing and sometimes as my wife

348
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:32,040
reminds me it's just it's best to stop

349
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:34,000
talking I just told the story about

350
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,630
Justin you're just not paying attention

351
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,779
man okay no and so one of the challenges

352
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,540
is you know we we spend a lot of our job

353
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,760
calling other people's babies ugly and

354
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,339
sometimes they don't like that and so

355
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,980
you have a finding and it has a risk

356
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,690
rating and sometimes they're not happy

357
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,810
when you say oh this is a high risk

358
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,000
rating because reasons and often they'll

359
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,589
ask well you know I really think this is

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,640
not the right risk rating you you should

361
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:05,640
lower it and my response is typically I

362
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,040
don't I don't want to get in an argument

363
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:18,790
with the client so you just don't answer

364
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,939
because it's not our job we observe

365
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,890
things we objectively report what we

366
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,380
have observed this is empirical data

367
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:29,140
that we're giving to the client it's up

368
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,720
to them to decide and introduce the

369
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,730
subjectivity of the context of that

370
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,490
finding so there may

371
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,350
maybe a very valid business reason for a

372
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,399
client to say okay fine this is a high

373
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,930
finding but we don't care because it's

374
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,970
not up to us as information well

375
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:48,670
depending on your job maybe you are

376
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,560
responsible for mitigating whatever

377
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:55,300
vulnerabilities you might find um but in

378
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,819
oftentimes the case is that it's up to

379
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,819
them so here's our observations here's

380
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,670
the findings and then you do whatever

381
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,550
you want with them so I guess what I'm

382
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,189
getting at there's no point in getting

383
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,649
in a philosophical debate about whether

384
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:15,399
something should be fixed make your

385
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:17,949
observations and then then move on

386
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,519
so I mentioned statements of work so

387
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:23,109
here's an excerpt of a statement of work

388
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,800
gig that I worked on recently you can

389
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,750
see all the text isn't there

390
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,219
that's intellectual property so I can't

391
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,430
show you the whole thing if you would

392
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:37,920
like to see the whole thing please take

393
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:41,829
one of my cards and hire NCC Group

394
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,880
shameful shameful yeah so so the problem

395
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,319
with the statement of work and you've

396
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,970
seen one so there's a lot of stuff on

397
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:48,880
there that at a high level describes

398
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,269
what sort of things we might do I mean

399
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,680
this isn't a checklist and that's why I

400
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:56,410
statements of work can be tricky to

401
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,388
write because you know as we're

402
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,589
improvising through the engagement we

403
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:02,980
might not do some of these things

404
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:05,319
depending on what our test cases reveal

405
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,650
about the security posture of whatever

406
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,659
it is that we're testing so when I

407
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,819
mentioned earlier you know this is kind

408
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,600
of like the sheet music you know we know

409
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:19,270
what the client is paying for but we may

410
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:25,270
or may not do these things in that order

411
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:26,980
or at Oulton for example I did a test at

412
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,750
a marketing firm Oh once do you know

413
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,919
what a marketing criminal is any oil and

414
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,510
gas folks in here okay yeah so it's

415
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,890
called a marketing terminal because and

416
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,510
this is not my client by the way so

417
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,220
don't try and you know figure out who

418
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,940
that is this is that you know

419
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,770
shamelessly stolen from Google marketing

420
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,450
Thermal is where the gas comes out of

421
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,200
the tank and they put it in the tanker

422
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,880
truck

423
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,820
and then they put additives in it and

424
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,320
then the tanker truck takes it to market

425
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,908
that's why it's called a marketing

426
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,000
terminal so the tanker truck takes it to

427
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:59,529
a gas station and then they sell it so

428
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,049
we were hired to do a vulnerability

429
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:05,500
assessment of the marketing terminal

430
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:08,139
with a huge caveat this is operational

431
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,750
technology you can't touch the network

432
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:12,699
and we said of ok what do you mean we

433
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,740
can't touch it like we'll do like really

434
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,120
lightweight scans or passive scans or

435
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,649
something they're like marinara you're

436
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,750
not going to have Ethernet connectivity

437
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:21,158
or any kind of connectivity at all

438
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,190
you're not going to plug in and we're

439
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,659
like ok how do we assess this thing they

440
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,399
said we're will give you all the Visio

441
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:29,289
diagrams you want we'll give you the

442
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:31,449
entire team that runs the plan the

443
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,158
marketing terminal and you've got a week

444
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,070
and we'll sit in there and we'll talk

445
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,350
about how everything is interconnected

446
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,320
and what potential vulnerabilities might

447
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:45,219
exist due to the architecture of the

448
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,950
system ok so we showed up and I had

449
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,720
never done this type of engagement

450
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,529
before so my boss met me in the parking

451
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,179
lot and we're about to walk in the door

452
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:57,880
and I said hey by the way have you

453
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,620
thought about like how are we going to

454
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,139
do this how are we going to be impactful

455
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,989
for the customer we don't have network

456
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:07,719
access at all and his hand was on the

457
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:11,440
door and he looked at me and he said I

458
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,210
have no effing idea and it's and then he

459
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,549
walked in yeah and so I'm standing there

460
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,470
right behind him like oh bloody hell

461
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,779
what are we going to do we got a week

462
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,880
with these people we have no plan and

463
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:25,419
it's what he meant it admit that he had

464
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,340
no effing idea what he meant was is that

465
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,950
we have to start interrogating the

466
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,110
client and gathering information before

467
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,899
we can understand what our attack chain

468
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,789
is going to be it's just the way he said

469
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:38,559
it kind of spooked me as you might

470
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,389
imagine so as it turns out we sat down

471
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,309
and on day 1 we started asking questions

472
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:44,049
you know we had diagrams and you just

473
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,610
like you start off feels like they've

474
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,470
been supporting this marketing terminal

475
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,178
for decades and we're just seeing this

476
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,860
for the very first time but as it turns

477
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,019
out that's ok

478
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,178
because they're not paying us to be

479
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:57,639
experts about their environment they're

480
00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:00,390
paying us to take advantage of the other

481
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,159
environments that we've seen and kind of

482
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:06,210
short circuit the process of learning

483
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,900
what this architecture is doing for the

484
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,630
business and for the technology and what

485
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,910
improvements are theoretically possible

486
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:17,640
and as it turns out it was a wildly

487
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,500
successful job we found a printer that

488
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,270
for whatever reason had two network

489
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,080
interfaces on it and it was connected to

490
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:27,780
both the the ICS network and the

491
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,149
business network and that theoretically

492
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,010
what was an interesting way that those

493
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,020
two networks were bridged when they were

494
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,050
not supposed to be interconnected at all

495
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,910
so we did have impactful findings even

496
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:43,500
though we never had OSI layer 3

497
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,240
connectivity to anything and you know we

498
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,480
had to think on our feet like I said you

499
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,790
know we had no idea here's another good

500
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,320
example so I don't expect you to be able

501
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,399
to read this I know that text is kind of

502
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,030
small

503
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,580
it's what's interesting about it is this

504
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,160
was a 9 step attack chain you know

505
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,840
starting at the top we gained access to

506
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,750
the network and then each of those nine

507
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,780
steps along the way we slowly got more

508
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:13,020
access to things and if you've ever been

509
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,149
a part of a big penetration test you

510
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,770
know you start off with nothing and the

511
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,050
objective is that you have some

512
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,150
unauthorized access of something you

513
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,210
know the running joke is yeah we had

514
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:27,780
domain admin by lunch well yeah you know

515
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,920
domain admin is one target that might be

516
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,920
important it's certainly not the only

517
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,170
one but throughout this process on step

518
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,290
one there at the very top you know we

519
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,910
plugged in to an Ethernet port and then

520
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,639
you know as me and five other

521
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:44,130
consultants are like okay well now what

522
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,660
and so then that starts you know you

523
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,730
might have a playbook or you might have

524
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,860
standard test cases that you use and you

525
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,750
know how you enumerate your network how

526
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,399
you identify potential targets and all

527
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,050
those sorts of things but at the end of

528
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,430
the day I mean it looks beautiful when

529
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,290
you look at it now is like wow nine

530
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,600
steps later and you've created your own

531
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,360
domain admin account but for every step

532
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,399
along that way there's that moment of

533
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,350
horror where you're like I don't know

534
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,780
what to do next and you have to

535
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,510
capitalize on your experience of having

536
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,350
seen similar things before but I think

537
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,350
that's an important

538
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:18,209
you know when you take training or

539
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,340
computer science classes or whatever we

540
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,009
tend to overlook the creative element of

541
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,189
what it is that we do and this was a

542
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:29,009
great example we were so happy obviously

543
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,690
that we had like one or two days left on

544
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:34,470
this engagement when we finally got

545
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:37,590
domain admin and yeah and there was much

546
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,149
rejoicing but every step along the way

547
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,860
like I said there was there was that

548
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,340
moment of horror where we didn't know

549
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,860
what to do

550
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:48,750
so we improvised and that's what

551
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:50,519
happened so back to the forced music

552
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,330
analogy I'm using when you're creating a

553
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,870
setlist yeah thank you know your

554
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,029
audience

555
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,039
okay this setlist happens to be what

556
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:01,789
Pearl Jam played at the New Orleans Jazz

557
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:08,730
and Heritage Festival in 2016

558
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:12,929
really is that what they played I'm

559
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:15,409
shocked so know your audience I mean

560
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:18,210
what your setlist looks like at a

561
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:20,340
wedding reception as I mentioned earlier

562
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,399
maybe not the same setlist you're going

563
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,379
to use in a Blues Bar or jazz inherited

564
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:28,110
faster or whatever so know your audience

565
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:29,820
know who you're talking to as it relates

566
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,529
to information security when you're

567
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,990
creating a statement of work now again

568
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:36,539
if you're during SEC ops or some sort of

569
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,980
other internal support maybe you don't

570
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,529
have to write statements of work but you

571
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:46,799
still need to communicate with whomever

572
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:48,539
you're your client is start at the top

573
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,658
and when I say the top if you like the

574
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:53,340
OSI model like I do it's not layer 7 I

575
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,840
mean technically layer 7 is the top at

576
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,689
layer 8 start at layer 8 that's the

577
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,730
business what is the business doing with

578
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,100
the system that's being tested they

579
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,440
implemented the system for some reason

580
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,309
what is that reason if you understand

581
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,690
what the reason is then you can

582
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,970
understand what are the value of the

583
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,279
information assets that that system

584
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,350
contains once you understand the value

585
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,179
of the information assets now you can

586
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:22,889
start thinking about how the actual

587
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:25,710
adversary might begin to attack them and

588
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:27,389
beware of any business unit that already

589
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,030
has a

590
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,040
test plan in place because I'm not

591
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:35,340
saying that people would want to try and

592
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,500
deceive us when we're simulating attacks

593
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,689
on their systems but sometimes though

594
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,310
you know that's the whole diversion

595
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,810
thing look at my hand here look at my

596
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,220
hand here don't don't look at this over

597
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,310
here

598
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:50,280
so give yourself some autonomy and again

599
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,780
think creatively and and don't limit

600
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,870
yourself to whatever the statement of

601
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,760
work might say and also the statement of

602
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,129
work as a contract for the consultants

603
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,110
in the room we always have this debate

604
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,970
internally on how much information

605
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,129
should actually be in the SAU again

606
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,470
we're not trying to be deceptive to our

607
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,680
clients but we don't want to limit

608
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,680
ourselves in what we're able to do so

609
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,280
yeah just be careful what you put in

610
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,210
your contract

611
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:31,200
so in closing expect the unexpected

612
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:33,060
what is the unexpected that yeah sorry

613
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:39,330
sorry hon I made some edits last night

614
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:46,110
after you went to bed yeah right right

615
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:48,330
right thank you thank you dad yeah don't

616
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,600
you should be careful when you ignore

617
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,300
your editor like all right so the

618
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,689
unexpected we had an ad FS an Active

619
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,100
Directory Federation services engagement

620
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,320
between between the time that the

621
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,879
statement of work was written and we

622
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,600
actually started the engagement the

623
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,920
entire project team had been replaced

624
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
and we didn't know that and so we get to

625
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,880
the kickoff call like two days before

626
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,820
the gig was supposed to start and the

627
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,010
new project team was unaware that we had

628
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,510
been hired to even do this and in the

629
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,430
interim they made some significant

630
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,800
changes to the environment such that it

631
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:26,160
was unavailable like I don't mean it was

632
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:31,050
like not production-ready like it wasn't

633
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,850
there at all so we you know had to be

634
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,649
flexible and creative and figure out how

635
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,580
to instrument a test on a non-existent

636
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,520
system oh we will store yeah we had to

637
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,379
reschedule it but yeah you know

638
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,970
yeah I mentioned earlier we're

639
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,790
publicly-traded man I've got a board of

640
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,320
directors that I got to keep happy and

641
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,899
shareholders know anyway and there was a

642
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,960
another example was there's a webapp pen

643
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,630
test and it was scoped everything was

644
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,760
described they signed it the you know

645
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,070
all that stuff and then during the

646
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,020
kickoff call somebody knew from the

647
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,030
technical side had joined the clients

648
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,639
team and as it turns out there was no

649
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:10,160
web app at all it was a browser plug-in

650
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,990
and I mean you can test the browser

651
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,090
plugin but the way you instrument such a

652
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,910
test is completely different than an

653
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,770
actual web app so we had to quickly

654
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,420
scramble and try and figure out you know

655
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,389
are we going to be able to do some

656
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,700
impactful testing I mean that was the

657
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,530
first finding which was okay the client

658
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,750
is apparently unable to support their

659
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:33,590
own system because they don't know what

660
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:35,990
it is no not to be cynical we didn't

661
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,399
actually write that up but but anyway so

662
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,800
expect the unexpected

663
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,280
our job is information security

664
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,139
professionals is to use systems in

665
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,580
unexpected ways to achieve unexpected

666
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,890
results right that's what we do

667
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,290
engineers design things and they assume

668
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:53,240
that people will use them as designed it

669
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:56,060
is our job to use them in unusual ways

670
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,040
to get those unusual results I hope

671
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:02,810
you've enjoyed my little story comments

672
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:04,620
questions not not you anyone else thank

673
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:07,760
you for your time you've been very kind

674
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,760
[Applause]
