1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:10,639
I can move a few things along by talking

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,639
about this now while we do this

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,949
basically I do end up doing a review of

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,020
modulo math because a lot when I've

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,310
talked to people about it saying you

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,750
know this is the basis of cryptography

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,669
and they're kind of like yeah I remember

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,820
anything that I think you do it in like

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,900
the sixth grade where you have remainder

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:34,110
like you do like 27 divided by 6 is for

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,820
remainders 3 and at the time I remember

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,200
doing that and I think it was about the

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,649
sixth grade and I was like why would

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,079
this ever be useful for anything and and

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,059
I went to Boston University to get my

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:51,180
master's in computer science and I went

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:55,980
oh my entire cryptography course was an

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,680
intensely deep study of modulo because

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,898
that's what all the cryptographic

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:07,380
algorithms are based on they're based on

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:10,409
the fact that if you say 27 27 mod six

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,449
which is basically 27 divided by 6 that

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,630
whatever the remainder is from that the

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,740
remainder is 3 but then if you say 33

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:23,220
mod 6 you also get remainder 3 so if

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,759
somebody says I have a number guess my

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,360
number if you do mod 6 you'll get 3 you

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,500
can't know for sure what its gonna be

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:44,820
because it could be any number of

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:47,009
numbers right number 3 so imagine that

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,770
you have these huge huge numbers with

32
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,770
hundreds of digits is it gonna open

33
00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:00,600
let's get a lot of pitches in it pretty

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:07,280
pictures so if you have these huge

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:10,169
numbers and oh there is PowerPoint yes

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,610
and then you know all you know is what

37
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,170
the remainder is at the end of doing

38
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,549
some operation with these numbers it's

39
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,458
impossible to know what the starting

40
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:21,629
number was and that's the basis of

41
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:31,760
diffie-hellman RSA and also elliptic

42
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:31,760
curve cryptography so I just saved about

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:42,090
thinking very hard thank you here it

44
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,119
comes

45
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,349
it has a unicorn in it my presentation I

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:54,950
thought it'd be nice to have a unicorn

47
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:57,510
on Sunday morning oh it's go be serious

48
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,429
the magical this is actually the title

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,950
of my presentation is the magical world

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,660
of elliptic curve cryptography but I

51
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,950
didn't want to do that in the submission

52
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,590
to no laconic because I was afraid

53
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,970
they'd think I was like crazy or that it

54
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,799
would be all about like you know the

55
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:18,480
relationship between My Little Pony and

56
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:24,569
cryptography thank you yes so excuse me

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:27,179
to flip the slides I just tap thank you

58
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,200
okay all right so here we are my name is

59
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,280
Michelle Bousquet

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:36,268
a little bit about me um this is some

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,769
things about me I am from New Orleans

62
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,859
which means I have a lot of wigs and

63
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,359
hats and tutus and I also do some

64
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,910
theater and I like to put on an orange

65
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,329
wig sometimes and pretend to be a

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,739
Russian hacker and videotape things and

67
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:51,000
anyway I'll give you my website at the

68
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,849
end if you wanna have a look at that

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,739
anyway um when I got my master's in

70
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,780
computer science as I was saying for bu

71
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,660
I had to take a cryptography course and

72
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,669
it was pretty intense but I really did

73
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,168
enjoy it because I'm a math geek but

74
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,150
then when I was trying to explain the

75
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,420
joys of cryptography to other people I

76
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,800
found that they didn't get it so

77
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,720
I wanted to come up with a simple

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,940
explanation of elliptic curve

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,298
cryptography so that if you're an

80
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,040
engineer or you're even just someone

81
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,388
who's involved in the industry and one

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,519
of your customers says to you well what

83
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,260
is that actually you can have a sort of

84
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,130
intelligent answer to give them without

85
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:31,150
having to spend 17 weeks deeply immersed

86
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:35,950
in math in a cryptography a graduate

87
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,630
level cryptography course so just a

88
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,930
really basic thing cryptography and

89
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,340
computing is used to transmit sensitive

90
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,600
information probably I don't think

91
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,330
there's anybody here that doesn't know

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,220
this but basically on any kind of device

93
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,840
that's going to transmit information

94
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,930
particularly wirelessly you want to be

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,330
able to encrypt it before sending it off

96
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,150
this is a big part of app programming

97
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,590
for example now when something goes

98
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,060
through the air that hacker can see it

99
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,039
so of course you want it to be safely

100
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,580
encrypted before it gets sent back and

101
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,340
forth so modulo map I touched on this a

102
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,219
little bit so we can buzz through this

103
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:16,810
if I say 27 divided by 7 is 3 remainder

104
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,630
6 the math way to express that is 27

105
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,220
months 7 equals 6 that's 3 we don't care

106
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,669
about ok about the 3 all we care about

107
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:28,000
is the remainder and you can see that if

108
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:31,359
you go with sequential numbers you will

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,610
get your remainder moving sequentially

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,190
and also that if you're using mod 7 the

111
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,200
only possible answers are 0 through 6

112
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,850
right the answer could never be 7

113
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,650
because it's 0 so this also works with

114
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,419
negative numbers if you need to do a

115
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,969
modulo with it but it's a little bit

116
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:55,240
different basically if you end up with a

117
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,100
negative number you keep adding 7 until

118
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,820
you get something between 0 and 6

119
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,940
basically with any kind of mod 7 every

120
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,310
the answer has to be between 0 and 6 so

121
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,450
it's kind of like having this box that

122
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:13,600
all it has in it is 0 through 6 and you

123
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,719
can take infinity any number up through

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,940
infinity positive or negative and it

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,479
ends up getting stuffed into this box

126
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,740
your answer will be 0 through 6

127
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,068
okay this that's that's our little

128
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,770
modulo refresher for those of you who

129
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:33,610
for whom the sixth grade is not a recent

130
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,698
memory okay so let's take a look at the

131
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,009
way that this is more like the way this

132
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,050
is used in cryptography now here I still

133
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,490
got relatively small numbers but we're

134
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,099
gonna do this with some bigger numbers

135
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,360
just to kind of make the point so

136
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:50,919
suppose I take they want to do this math

137
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,150
problem 385 to the 57th power mod 293

138
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,729
you could probably get out your

139
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,530
calculator and get an answer it's gonna

140
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,508
be 89 because that's a forward

141
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,960
calculation no problem

142
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:05,110
but suppose you try to go the other way

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,638
you don't know what the power is and you

144
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,259
want to go this way and you know what

145
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,500
the answer is at the other end well how

146
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:15,190
do you figure out what X is well this is

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,840
what misters Diffie and Hellman figured

148
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:22,630
out back at me 70s is that there's no

149
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:28,750
formula for this the only way to get it

150
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:32,050
is brute force so this is the one of the

151
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:36,759
cornerstones of the original encryption

152
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:39,039
formulas so the way that diffie-hellman

153
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,479
works and various other key exchanges at

154
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,830
a very basic level and you probably

155
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,400
learn this at some point but again this

156
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,960
is a refresher is that meaning we want

157
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,370
to exchange some information securely so

158
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,039
we need to have the same cryptographic

159
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,539
key or at least corresponding ones if

160
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,840
you were going to do public and private

161
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:01,539
or something like that so both of us

162
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,549
need to at our ends figure out our

163
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:07,409
secure key without passing any

164
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:12,639
information between us that would expose

165
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:15,099
that would expose what happen there it's

166
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,130
like a magnetic field that suddenly

167
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:22,719
appeared in my midst or something

168
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:25,300
because we need to be able to generate

169
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,680
this key without passing information

170
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,240
back and forth because if I generate a

171
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,029
key and send it to you the hacker could

172
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,560
see that you know there's you have to

173
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:33,189
there had to be a way to do that and

174
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,439
this is again

175
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,110
Diffie and Hellman figured out so what

176
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,880
we do is we have a formula and we have

177
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,229
some starting numbers and those are in

178
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,210
the middle the hacker knows what those

179
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,280
are they're actually known they're

180
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:50,080
published everybody is using the same

181
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,670
ones but I have a secret number and you

182
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,670
have a secret number and we don't tell

183
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,890
anybody what that is and we have the

184
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,790
starting numbers that we've exchanged we

185
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,760
know what those are

186
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:04,180
so we each do a modulo formula on it and

187
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,670
we get a result so for example I take

188
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,209
385 and I put it to the power of my

189
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,449
secret number and do mod 293 and get to

190
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,300
20 so the hacker knows the 385 and the

191
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,120
293 but he doesn't know my X and you do

192
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,829
the same on your side so then we pass

193
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,470
our remainders over and the hacker can't

194
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,920
figure out what that XS because there's

195
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,950
no because unless they use brute force

196
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,290
then I take your result and my secret

197
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,150
number and I do another formula with

198
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,130
them and you can look up exactly the

199
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,530
formula with this but the Diffie and

200
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,200
Hellman found that I can take my secret

201
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,720
number get a result send it to you and

202
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,400
take your secret or your result and Miss

203
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,320
do something with it with my secret

204
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,449
number and at the very end we won't end

205
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,040
up with exactly the same key and it's

206
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,200
actually really cool the first time I

207
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,360
saw this I was like oh my god that's so

208
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,070
cool and I took you know I did like some

209
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,270
threes and sevens and fives very low

210
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,660
numbers to try it out because it is

211
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,670
really interesting and very cool of

212
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,610
course if your numbers are very low like

213
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,709
this it's easy to brute-force it but the

214
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,680
the numbers that we're using here have

215
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,820
hundreds of digits and it's it'd be very

216
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,310
difficult to brute-force

217
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,770
so the hacker knows what the numbers are

218
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,209
that got passed back and forth but the

219
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,199
only way they could figure out the keys

220
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,210
different for it so this is just in you

221
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,240
know how you would brute-force a key

222
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,880
this is a very small table but some

223
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,140
hackers do make tables look-up tables

224
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:41,280
for known numbers known prime because

225
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,260
usually using prime numbers and some

226
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,870
devices sometimes they're very lazy and

227
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,100
they use like the same prime number that

228
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,600
everybody else is using and a hacker

229
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,040
might have a table of that but you can

230
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,740
see where the tables would get really

231
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,469
really huge so it's impractical for a

232
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,810
hacker to have tables like this plus if

233
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,839
you are having a secure connection going

234
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,819
on the really good ones anyway they will

235
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,470
refresh themselves after an hour or two

236
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,930
or so half an hour or some period of

237
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,000
time so new keys will get exchanged and

238
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,609
by the time they figured out your key

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,690
you already got a different key so

240
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,150
ideally that's the way it works and it

241
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,890
keeps everything secure so all this is

242
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,860
going on every time you go on to your

243
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:24,569
phone and buy something on Amazon all

244
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:30,730
this is going on in the background so

245
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:34,240
RSA is is this standard that's still

246
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,370
safe to use it's difficult I don't think

247
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,560
it's all by itself isn't used anymore

248
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,890
RSA has a little more complicated math

249
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,709
going on but it's the same principle and

250
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,779
it is safe to use but every few years

251
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,880
NIST and other organizations start

252
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,529
recommending that the keys are tous is

253
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,689
getting too small if you want your

254
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:57,730
devices to be secure five years from now

255
00:11:52,690 --> 00:12:00,459
you need to bump up from 1024 size key

256
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,430
to 2048 if you want it to be safe past

257
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:05,859
the year you know 2030 you're gonna need

258
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,810
to bump it up again so the keys keep

259
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,180
getting longer and longer and longer and

260
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,459
when they do that it takes more and more

261
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,319
power and more time to generate the keys

262
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:16,300
and to do the exchange and stuff like

263
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,459
that maybe it's only measuring in

264
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,189
milliseconds but we also at the same

265
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,800
time we're getting less patient you know

266
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,110
I've got her day I went on two ways

267
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,240
which I use for directions and I hid

268
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,400
ways and I had to wait three and a half

269
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,950
seconds and I was like what like what

270
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,779
what so then I went to Google Maps and

271
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:40,450
Google Maps only took like two and a

272
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:43,120
quarter seconds we're inpatient and also

273
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:46,180
battery power when you are you have a

274
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,920
device how frustrating it is it way is

275
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:54,279
another thing is it just chews up

276
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:56,530
battery power it's frustrating so before

277
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,530
I get into what ECC is elliptic curve

278
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,560
cryptography it is a completely it's not

279
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,779
completely different

280
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,660
method but it's still the same idea of

281
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,370
exchanging information where you and I

282
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,290
can generate the same key without

283
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,960
revealing anything to a hacker but it

284
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,819
uses a different kind of math and just

285
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,440
an idea here these are the different key

286
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:21,290
sizes for RSA and for ECC and for a

287
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,270
hacker to brute force one of these keys

288
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,740
look at the difference in the sizes you

289
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:29,810
can have a 138 bit key that takes the

290
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,950
same amount of it that does the same job

291
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,959
of a 1024 and smaller keys are faster to

292
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,339
compute use less power especially if

293
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,690
you're doing a little out of computing

294
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:42,320
this is a big gonna make a big

295
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:46,930
difference and if you look also as RSA

296
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:50,180
the size of the RSA key doubles the ECC

297
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:55,189
size key size does not double it only it

298
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,660
big they get larger at a lower rate so

299
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,180
as we're going into these bigger and

300
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:03,770
bigger keys the divide is going to be

301
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:09,260
even bigger okay so let's see how does

302
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:11,329
this work it's fancy math there's a lot

303
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,280
online about this and if you want to get

304
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,810
him deeper into the math after seeing

305
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,620
this great but at least this will give

306
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,119
you a foundation if you like me came to

307
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,290
a certain understanding and said ok

308
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,990
that's all I need to know about that

309
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,530
then that's good too

310
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,970
all right so these are elliptic curves

311
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,380
remember in math class the teacher would

312
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:35,089
give you a formula and you had a drug

313
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,800
Raph so this is the type of formula that

314
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,570
they follow something squared equals

315
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,449
something cubed plus something times

316
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,940
something plus something right so these

317
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,860
curves these are their formulas and

318
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,630
they're really easy to draw you just

319
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,709
pick you know start off with x equals

320
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:53,839
zero and you know you get five on that

321
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,640
one the one on the Left and then you put

322
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,450
in one two three fourths so you can draw

323
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:03,140
your curve these are really pretty

324
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:06,410
looking ones that are easy to see and

325
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,180
the numbers are very small the the

326
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,469
constants are very small we got threes

327
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,579
and fives there's some pretty intense

328
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,339
formulas for these but they all follow

329
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,170
that

330
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,269
we're gonna just look at a really really

331
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,439
simple one today to get the concept of

332
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,439
what how these are useful in

333
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:26,339
cryptography so we're gonna look at this

334
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:29,730
one and this is my disclaimer if you use

335
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,559
description you are an idiot but it's

336
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,449
really good for your illustrator

337
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:38,430
purposes so we're only interested in

338
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:40,439
integer pairs we're not interested in

339
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:45,599
any fractions or decimals or anything

340
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:48,059
and this is true for for ECC also so we

341
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,939
have some pairs here and notice that we

342
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:58,350
have the negative ones we have 1 3 + 1 -

343
00:15:50,939 --> 00:16:00,689
3 4 + 4 9 and so on so at some point the

344
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,329
graph goes nearly vertical with any

345
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:07,349
elliptic curve go back a little bit take

346
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:09,269
a look at those see how it at some point

347
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,860
they go nearly vertical and you're not

348
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,240
going to find any more integer pairs so

349
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,399
you need to just stick to the ones that

350
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,620
you have that are within that okay so

351
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:25,379
here we have this curve and we're going

352
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:27,959
to perform modulo mapping on a graph but

353
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:29,790
you've never done that before so the

354
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,179
concept here is remember we have that

355
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,679
box that only contains 0 through 6 and

356
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,290
all the numbers would get shoved in the

357
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:41,579
box we're gonna shove everything into

358
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:45,149
that part of the graph the 7 by 7 so all

359
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:47,059
of the points the XY points are going to

360
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:50,699
be numbers 0 through 6

361
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:55,620
so you basically take the integer points

362
00:16:50,699 --> 00:17:00,240
and going back a bit here we have this

363
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,980
negative point C 1 + -3 minus 3 is not

364
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,420
within our seven by seven but remember

365
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,000
for negative numbers you keep adding

366
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:09,000
seven so that's going to end up being

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,189
one for you got it the negative 3 you

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,319
add 7 to it it's 4 and now it's in the 7

369
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:20,699
by 7 modulo box so when we do that we

370
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:23,490
shove everything in there and we end up

371
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:27,560
with this in our little 7 by 7 box

372
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:31,060
everything all of the X's and Y's are

373
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:36,429
between zero and six so these are our

374
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:39,260
points oops no no too far here all right

375
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,840
so what we're gonna do is look at these

376
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,870
two points four two and six six these

377
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,100
are two of the points we ended up with

378
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,669
and we're gonna draw a line between them

379
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:55,790
and then we're going to extend that line

380
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:57,800
off outside of our box and then because

381
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,889
it's outside the box we can map it back

382
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,510
into the modulo space so we map it back

383
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,160
into the modulo space and there is a

384
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,110
line it's coming through here now of

385
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,460
course this programs that do this for

386
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,740
you obviously you're not going to sit

387
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,570
there with a piece of graph paper every

388
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,220
time somebody tries to you know buy

389
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:19,060
something from New Ager or something

390
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:23,210
yeah it's a joke god you guys man coffee

391
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:24,860
and then it loops around you know you go

392
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,290
back out and then loop it back around

393
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:32,149
until you hit one of the other points on

394
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,510
the curve you follow how that works

395
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:37,250
drew a line between two of the points

396
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:39,980
kept mapping it back into the modulo

397
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,650
space I see some frowny faces okay let's

398
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,720
go back a little bit we're taking all of

399
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:49,790
these points and mapping them into our

400
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,400
mod space our six by six mod seven space

401
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,560
so every point every line everything

402
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,400
that happens we're just going to keep

403
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:02,230
you know mod setting on every point that

404
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,230
we get to shove it back in there okay

405
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:09,140
that makes sense okay so we get this

406
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,760
line push it back in there and we end up

407
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:17,840
landing on one of the other points on

408
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:20,470
the graph so what we say because we

409
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,500
finally landed on another integer point

410
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:30,140
we say that for two plus six six equals

411
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,780
one for in elliptic curve math all right

412
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,730
so you start off with two points and you

413
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,160
do this thing and then you end up with

414
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,630
one and there's a formula for this you

415
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,850
can Wikipedia it it's it's

416
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,960
I mean I knew this was gonna be Sunday

417
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,659
morning I didn't want to hit you with

418
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,039
that but this is the basic idea is that

419
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:56,700
you're the the addition the operator the

420
00:19:50,039 --> 00:20:02,429
addition operator means that okay so the

421
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:05,840
cool thing about this wait for it you

422
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:08,640
can't figure out you can't go backwards

423
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,399
except with brute force and that's the

424
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,390
magic of elliptic curves is that going

425
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,210
forward very easy figuring out what X is

426
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:21,059
in this situation really really hard

427
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,460
what you would need is a table just like

428
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:25,500
you would need for modulo math if you

429
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,630
wanted to figure out what that was if

430
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,750
you have a complex enough elliptic curve

431
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,190
and there's like a dozen or so of them

432
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,150
that are recommended for use for

433
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,700
cryptography this is not one of them

434
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:43,200
telling you again

435
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:45,630
so it's the same type of thing I have a

436
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,100
starting point and you have a starting

437
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:52,830
point and we both have a point that

438
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,129
we're going to add and the addition by

439
00:20:52,830 --> 00:21:01,830
the way is commutative you can switch

440
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:03,360
them back and forth so I could it

441
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,120
doesn't matter which way you add them

442
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,639
you could say you know a plus B or B

443
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,370
plus a either way so I have a point and

444
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,110
you have a point and then it as a secret

445
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,699
point that we have and then we have a

446
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,729
point that's known that we're going to

447
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,950
add to it and a curve that we're going

448
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,470
to use so that we know our formula that

449
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,659
we're going to use and we both calculate

450
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,250
and we get our result and we send them

451
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,080
to each other and the hacker can see the

452
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,809
result but he can't brute force what our

453
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,059
secret one is then we do more math on

454
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:36,090
the results that we got from each other

455
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:39,600
and we end up with the same key so in

456
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:44,280
this way this parallels all of the key

457
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,770
exchange concepts that we've used all

458
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,470
along it just takes advantage of the

459
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,930
fact that with elliptic curves when you

460
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,880
have this thing about the two points

461
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,100
adding two points together to get a

462
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,290
result that it has the same quality of

463
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,689
it it's you can't go backwards without

464
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:05,310
brute force and it has the advantage of

465
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:10,350
the keys that the keys are much smaller

466
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:13,550
and the calculation goes faster so

467
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:16,250
remember we talked about brute forcing

468
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,649
keys when you're using modulo the

469
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:22,950
original type of modulo math this is a

470
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:25,140
really simple table for how you would

471
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,770
hack easy see you would need a table

472
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,810
where this is the addition of you know

473
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,540
the points across the top and the points

474
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:37,889
down the left and then you have a where

475
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,480
the two of them meet like everybody see

476
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:43,260
what I mean and some of them go to

477
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:47,580
infinity so you don't use those a good

478
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:50,280
algorithm won't let you use those but

479
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,370
the tables are there's a mirror image

480
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,830
aspect to it of it where if you add you

481
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,060
know if you look across adding it one

482
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,860
way and adding it another way you're

483
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,889
gonna get the same answer but this is

484
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,449
just 25 by 25 points now imagine if

485
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,160
there were hundreds and hundreds and

486
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:14,340
yeah the hacker had to calculate

487
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:16,470
calculate so it's less hackable so so is

488
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,919
everybody with me so far there's some

489
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:22,380
witness yeah okay good yes so that's

490
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,950
pretty much all I was gonna say about

491
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,450
how it works and that's you know this

492
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,730
gives you something that you're at a

493
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:34,320
meeting in some ways just we use UCC or

494
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:37,140
RSA you could say well you know she was

495
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,810
buzz word from my presentation and Salo

496
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,310
smarter no no more you know okay so now

497
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:43,070
we're gonna talk a little bit about more

498
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:47,510
about how it's used and why you need it

499
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:51,240
so this is from MIT from February 2018

500
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:54,570
they came up with this chip that uses

501
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,760
ECC and it says reduces power

502
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,439
consumption of public key encryption by

503
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,440
ninety nine point seventy five percent

504
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,930
and increases speed five hundred fold

505
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,890
and they actually already had an ECC

506
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:10,310
chip that they

507
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:14,100
developed but they they actually put the

508
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,960
the calculation stuff on the chip it's

509
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,199
hardware based now instead of software

510
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,530
based so this was kind of cool

511
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,110
now I try to find information on exactly

512
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,580
which types of devices use ECC but as

513
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,040
you can imagine a lot of companies are

514
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,230
not too eager to discuss in detail what

515
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,180
they're doing with their encryption but

516
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,030
I did manage to find some different

517
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,400
situations where it's used to use them

518
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,780
thermostats the sensors for all the

519
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:46,140
autonomous vehicles that are being

520
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:49,980
tested ECC is obviously very desirable

521
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:53,370
because it uses less power it's faster

522
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,230
it's very safe you know it's one thing

523
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,810
to have your network hacked it's another

524
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,220
to have your car hacked if someone hacks

525
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,800
your network probably you're not going

526
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,600
to hit a pedestrian you know as opposed

527
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:08,129
to the danger it's the physical dangers

528
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:11,879
of it and a lot of you know home

529
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:14,190
security systems will use it and most of

530
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,560
the mobile devices have it available to

531
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,620
apps if you're developing a mobile app

532
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,980
you've had the option using ECC for your

533
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,979
app as long as you build it in so that's

534
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,010
basically why you would want to use it

535
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,500
it's more efficient use with less power

536
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,540
better safety with smaller keys and

537
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:40,110
that's all I have to say about that

538
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:44,070
today and my next slide talks about me

539
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:46,350
as I mentioned I sometimes put on an

540
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,760
orange wig and talk about security if

541
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,199
you want to come to my website and visit

542
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,000
me I also have a password quiz to find

543
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,650
out how much you know about passwords

544
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,320
and what are good passwords it's very

545
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,630
simple and also my email address to

546
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,620
complain when you don't do get a good

547
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:07,980
score on the quiz so any questions about

548
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,800
ECC I think like that are you guys all a

549
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,800
year to get to the prizes it's gonna be

550
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:18,530
drawings of prizes coming up

551
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:23,760
yeah we good we really oh yes

552
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:26,250
what's that why no wig today this is my

553
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,570
first time presenting at NOLA con and I

554
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,460
was a little worried they wouldn't take

555
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,379
me seriously if I showed up in an orange

556
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,300
wig and started talking in a Russian

557
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,890
accent about you know steal your

558
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:44,159
Pittsburgh you know now that I've been

559
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:46,260
here and you know next year could be a

560
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,520
little bit different I might just submit

561
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,690
with the picture of me and the orange

562
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,310
wig and do a whole thing like that but

563
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:56,160
yeah this is Scott Lana

564
00:26:53,310 --> 00:27:12,929
did a lot more fun than me which really

565
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:14,640
does any other questions this the

566
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,730
question is why would somebody still

567
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,110
continue to use RSA probably there's

568
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,130
more support for it it's more

569
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:26,610
established it's the easy way out a lot

570
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,800
of PC based stuff still uses RSA because

571
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,389
it's you know your piece is plugged in

572
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:36,990
if the power consumption isn't as much

573
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:38,550
of an issue so the question was from a

574
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,910
theoretical standpoint would you always

575
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:44,909
want to choose ECC I would and I know

576
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:47,460
that everything that I've read is like

577
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,920
recommending it and pushing it but it's

578
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,200
you know you got people who've been

579
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,160
doing this job for 10 20 years and

580
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,870
everything is very familiar and they

581
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,220
don't want to have to move into

582
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,239
something else which they have to

583
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:06,540
support and be responsible for so it's

584
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,060
you know it's gonna take either take

585
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:11,460
some time or take some pushback from the

586
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,550
industry where where there has to be

587
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:17,010
some serious RSA fail or something

588
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:20,430
before it's going to be but it is being

589
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,750
used more and more and I mean one of the

590
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,850
things is that consumers don't

591
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,140
understand the difference so for example

592
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:29,080
there was some recent thing

593
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:31,630
we're not so recent but the Belkin home

594
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,389
security devices turned out to be easily

595
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:37,090
hackable and they were all using RSA so

596
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,620
I when I would buy a home security

597
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:44,590
device I would want to know what was

598
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:46,750
using ECC but you know my family other

599
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,800
family members we wanted an InfoSec

600
00:28:46,750 --> 00:29:00,130
don't care all right any other questions

601
00:28:49,800 --> 00:29:02,490
yes I do not have an opinion on which

602
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:06,430
elliptical curve to trust the most

603
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:08,770
huh I know that NIST recommends like 15

604
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,720
different ones and I don't I don't

605
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,330
having a practical experience with it to

606
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,480
really answer that question but I would

607
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:19,540
you know easy enough to find which ones

608
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,760
and also following the advice of my

609
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,990
cryptography professor where he said

610
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,990
don't ever try to write your own

611
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:28,240
cryptographic function just because it's

612
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,830
just always a bad idea there's other

613
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,330
people who devoted their life to this

614
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,399
and they have teams of people testing

615
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,010
stuff so there is all there's already

616
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,080
modules out there that have been found

617
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,940
to be safe and secure and everything and

618
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,629
you would just end up you know if with

619
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,580
any language there's going to be a you

620
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,170
know some functions somewhere some

621
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,310
module that you can include that it's

622
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,780
going to include all that and you just

623
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,800
have to get it into your code and

624
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:56,379
working so that's great question though

625
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,870
I'd have I should find that out for the

626
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,520
next time I can present my favorite

627
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:05,949
elliptic curve and I could draw a little

628
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:08,860
hearts and rainbows on it all right

629
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,430
anything else anybody any questions who

630
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:14,800
wants to win things in the drawing oh

631
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:17,450
come on that's an easy question all

632
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:21,779
right thank you very much

633
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,779
[Applause]
