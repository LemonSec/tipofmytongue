1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:12,870
all right welcome it's early still

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:13,889
everyone hang up hungover I'm not so

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,869
this is gonna be formula for a bug

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:20,220
bounty program before we get started

5
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,439
everything discussed here is based on

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,130
our experiences over the past six years

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,070
past twelve months I there's a few for

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,630
looking statements I might make that's

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,809
not a binding contract we're gonna do

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,790
something in our program but really just

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:39,120
things we're thinking about certain so

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,010
the future remains malleable so I'm here

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,899
to talk about bug bounty in general but

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,269
also specifically what it is at Verizon

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,760
Media if you don't know Verizon Media is

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,460
now one of the three pillars of Verizon

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,030
business consumer media media covers

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,699
brands and advertising formerly known as

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,199
o'the or Verizon AOL you go back in time

20
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:04,470
so what does bug bounty in general and

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,539
specifically at at our company and then

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,820
jump in to some tips on building a great

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,250
program and I'll sprinkle in some

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,889
lessons from the past six years but also

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,970
some particular stories from past twelve

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,790
months when when I joined the team which

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,070
was our biggest year yet our security

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,530
team at Verizon media is called the

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,158
paranoids because we are paranoid a

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,939
little bit here a little bit there

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,880
there's we have over 175 members on our

32
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,298
team covering all sorts of functions red

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,089
team blue team with proc security and

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,159
assurance we've got architects we've got

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,560
GRC we've got we do all the things we

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,350
strive to do all the things but our

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,960
mission is to protect our consumers

38
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,219
customers and corporate data we fight

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,530
for our users and everything that we do

40
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:01,259
so I'm Chris I like to take things apart

41
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,570
and sometimes put them back together if

42
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,119
I'm able to mostly I just like to learn

43
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,669
how the hell things work what what makes

44
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,169
it tick I've been working on application

45
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,059
and product security for nine years now

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,410
and when I took my first edition I

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,430
really had zero experience in security

48
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,870
throughout my entire life I work with

49
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,340
computers everywhere I could build them

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,010
break them program them and you know mix

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,569
that with propensity to learn how do

52
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,179
things work and I became a software

53
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:34,200
engineer my intro to security though was

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,849
a single elective in college followed by

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,310
a friend who pointed me to the OWASP

56
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:44,940
wiki pages back in 2011 and a nearly

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,670
failed interview later Here I am right

58
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,959
that's just how things happen but I like

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,170
to tell people security is a mindset

60
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,220
more than a skillset it's a different

61
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,609
way of thinking about same kind of

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,989
problems so it's pretty easy it was it

63
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,720
was easy for me to make a transition

64
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,220
from engineering to security and a lot

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,930
of people kind of see that as well so we

66
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,209
regularly looked for people from the

67
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,519
engineering side of the house that we

68
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,470
can pull over to the security team if

69
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,959
they show start to show that security

70
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,659
mindedness or if we can train them to be

71
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,290
security minded if you're a good builder

72
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,030
you could be a good breaker now though

73
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,650
the blood binding team and I operate one

74
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,980
of the one of the world's largest and

75
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,450
most successful bug bounty programs our

76
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,790
team actually dropped to zero staff at

77
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,609
one point last year and then we picked

78
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,420
back up to five but we're settled in how

79
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,390
around four and and throughout 2018 we

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,640
participated in four different live

81
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,548
hacking events and I'll get to kind of

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,290
what those are later but we had to

83
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,580
spread all around the world two of them

84
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,769
we actually worked with our vendor

85
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,110
hacker one to custom design the event

86
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,450
structure to test some theories innovate

87
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,890
on the format and what what is life

88
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,200
hacking what does it need to be what is

89
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,450
it what is it what could it be can we

90
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,659
get more out of it can we produce more

91
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,619
value and a more engaging experience

92
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,840
rather than just bringing people into

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,910
the room and throwing some money at them

94
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,500
a program for gang of paying out

95
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:17,010
bounties in 2013 and last year alone we

96
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,260
paid out more than five million dollars

97
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,480
sidenote but super critical if you take

98
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,570
one thing away from this it should be

99
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,600
that the amount of money spent is not a

100
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:32,169
measure of success or failure it's not a

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,330
measure of security or insecurity it's

102
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,219
just how much money you spend you can

103
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,349
arbitrarily increase or decrease that

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,139
and it will produce all sorts of things

105
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,350
but money spent is not a measure of

106
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,000
success I constantly have to tell people

107
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,440
that because that's one of those big

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,700
things that we see that we hear about

109
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,169
his money spent really expensive bugs

110
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,050
$250,000 for iPhone jailbreak if it

111
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,299
exists right programs that will maybe

112
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,950
just like I don't want to name so the

113
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,870
other ones but there's groups out there

114
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,300
that just buy zero days right

115
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,600
that's money spent but it's does it

116
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,830
prove that the product is secure or not

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,490
not really right we all know that

118
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,630
vulnerabilities exist everywhere last

119
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,229
year we actually restructured our

120
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,830
process and the amount of money that we

121
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:22,450
offer and bounties and expanded the

122
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:30,460
number of products and brands that were

123
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:32,800
in our program right now we're working

124
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,870
through the the reorganization of

125
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,900
merging all of our companies together

126
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,560
under Verizon we had a lot more to offer

127
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,859
into our blood binding program so so we

128
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,310
grew like exponentially or multiple lacs

129
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,930
want to say even but the point is the

130
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,270
dollar amount is more of a function of

131
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,539
the energy and attention that we got

132
00:05:52,270 --> 00:06:00,909
that we were able to invest into the

133
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:03,159
program so last year we had nearly 2,000

134
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,760
reports spread across those five million

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,880
dollars that we accepted and fixed we

136
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,979
had many more that like come in but

137
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,440
those duplicates there's garbage there's

138
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:16,750
all sorts of things but nearly 2000 were

139
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,300
valid and good reports that we fixed

140
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,699
which is awesome that's 2,000 bugs that

141
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,199
don't exist

142
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,389
but that doesn't get into the previous

143
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,550
1,200 business days which we're not

144
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,999
publishing numbers for so there's just

145
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,360
this 2018 number on average it takes us

146
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:38,149
25 days to take a report in fix it

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,939
test it deploy it and pay researches so

148
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:42,949
the whole lifecycle from research is

149
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:46,459
submit something to getting paid which

150
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:51,110
is we put at the end of our our plan is

151
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:53,389
25 days which is not the fastest but

152
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,459
it's pretty great if you consider that

153
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,770
there's really no industry standard for

154
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:00,110
respond abilities closure programs and

155
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:05,389
how fast the turnaround is on those but

156
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:08,029
I generally people expect 60 days and we

157
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,580
pay them in 25 so we're we're beating

158
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:13,430
that expectation and we tend to be

159
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,769
consistent with this so sometimes it

160
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,849
come down three days sometimes it's 62

161
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:25,219
days but on average we're doing great

162
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:27,169
and our hackers team thinks our to over

163
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:29,209
the the lifespan of our program we had

164
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,639
over three actually that's not happening

165
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:33,080
that's not right

166
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,729
fix that don't look at that a minute

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,669
over three thousand researchers nearly

168
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:39,258
four thousand actually from over 60

169
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,948
countries that participated on in our

170
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:44,479
program have submitted reports to us

171
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,589
literally all over the world but that

172
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,539
number is really hard to understand

173
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:49,939
without some perspective about what

174
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,248
related to what right how many how many

175
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,619
people are out there I don't have the

176
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:56,839
data for other platforms but I'll use

177
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:59,209
some data from hacker one because we're

178
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,860
partnered with them and they frankly did

179
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:05,689
the research they produced a report I

180
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,800
think annually about the state of plug

181
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:10,069
bounty which came out a couple months

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,869
ago you want to look it up and they said

183
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,599
they found that on their platform they

184
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:16,430
have 300,000 people that are registered

185
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,969
300,000 hacker accounts exist on their

186
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,089
platform of those 10 percent have ever

187
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:26,449
actually submitted a bug not great right

188
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:29,180
10 percent participation ok of those 10

189
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,889
percent only a quarter one in four have

190
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,860
ever gotten paid so two and a half

191
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,490
percent of the overall okay so that's

192
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,159
something

193
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,589
why numbers across the platform how do

194
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,088
we compare that to our program

195
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:46,279
well we've seen 3900 nearly 4000

196
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:50,600
researchers in our program over the past

197
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:55,100
six years and of those we've paid 800 oh

198
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:58,040
I think it's over 850 which means that

199
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,330
one in five of the people in our program

200
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,980
have ever gotten paid

201
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,649
so we're little little lower than that

202
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,930
the standard platform average but that

203
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:08,740
also means a thirteen percent of the

204
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,870
people that participate in bug bounty I

205
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,450
have worked with us have worked for us

206
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:18,770
an eleven percent of the people that

207
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,570
have been paid have been paid by us so

208
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,459
if you consider that we are one program

209
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,370
and there's hundreds and hundreds of

210
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:29,869
other programs out there we're a pretty

211
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:32,959
large chunk of it right and we do all of

212
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,500
that with a team of three people we we

213
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,349
just signed somebody for our fourth but

214
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,390
he'll be starting in a few weeks so

215
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,850
maybe we'll have more on that later at

216
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,459
another conference chump or so director

217
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,130
of product security insurance product

218
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:51,290
Security's our team that partners with

219
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,170
product development teams to build

220
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,029
security into everything we work on less

221
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,670
shifting all of the security activities

222
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:01,220
and and going deeper into the

223
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,029
development side rather than just break

224
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,770
it at the end mark Litchfield

225
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:09,050
if you're familiar with bug bounty you

226
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,050
probably recognize his name he's been a

227
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,270
longtime researcher in the world of bug

228
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,599
bounty formerly one of actually our top

229
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,209
hackers he I think won some of our

230
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,820
events in the past and he still probably

231
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:26,140
holds one of our top five slots but he

232
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,029
joined our team last year to help with

233
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,430
with running the program and it's been

234
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,930
fantastic to work with him and then of

235
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,819
course we've got we're supported by all

236
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,390
of the other paranoid schemes Incident

237
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:42,770
Response which we call fire because

238
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:43,880
everything is on fire right you know all

239
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,740
sorts of things and if you want to hear

240
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,300
more about the paranoids we've got a

241
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,980
table outside and the red team is

242
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,729
running a seat

243
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,660
village with I think that the hardware

244
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,690
is open-source now

245
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,319
which is pretty cool yeah it is that

246
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,930
actually one of our team members design

247
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,040
that's pretty cool there's some really

248
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,089
interesting bugs that they've developed

249
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,150
into the hardware

250
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:10,060
I recommend Hank checking that out so so

251
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,699
what that's some numbers but what is bug

252
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,219
browning how do you get to as you know

253
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,320
what's the core of a successful program

254
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,370
we have to define what bug bounty is it

255
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,730
means different things to different

256
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,320
sides of the of the with the space right

257
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,570
it means a different thing to a program

258
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,240
then it does to a hacker or to the

259
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,910
platform that brings those things

260
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,700
together we're gonna look at it from a

261
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,550
program perspective because that's where

262
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,580
we sit so we can take it down in just

263
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,939
the words write the name bug bounty bug

264
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,940
in terms of software is something that's

265
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,310
not working the way it should right and

266
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,370
bounty is a reward pay for a specific

267
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,079
result okay but there's teams that do

268
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:58,690
this kind of thing teams that find bugs

269
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,400
in software this is a generic structure

270
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,530
with a whole bunch of functions that a

271
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,810
security organization might have their

272
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,680
report up to your sis oh you're

273
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:10,989
engineering is going to be separate than

274
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:14,079
that most likely so so where where do

275
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,260
these things exist well bug bounty could

276
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,300
fit in a lot of places researchers are

277
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,950
testing resource and they they really

278
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,250
simulate being attacked by an adversary

279
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,470
and then produce test cases that's kind

280
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,170
of like what the red team does it's kind

281
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,520
of like what application security does

282
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,680
internal pen tests external pen tests

283
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,490
with with some elevated knowledge in

284
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,020
some cases information gathering whether

285
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,550
you go directly to the product team or

286
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:45,130
you doing you know soon so we could say

287
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:48,819
it's just the pen test right you get a

288
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,350
report and you know it there's there's

289
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,120
particular work that happens you know

290
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,520
what happens on the schedule you can you

291
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,770
know work around that it's gonna cost

292
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,840
whatever it costs staff is cheaper than

293
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,850
going outsourced but you get what you

294
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,440
pay for if you want to pay a lot you can

295
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,840
get better

296
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,640
quality right cost is gonna cost and

297
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:11,130
quality are gonna vary by who you've

298
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:13,140
hired but it's also very much not a pen

299
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,210
test because the people participating in

300
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,480
the program are not employees they're

301
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,190
not contractors even so you really can't

302
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,330
count on being able to control anything

303
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:26,220
that they do so the rules of engagement

304
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,710
like get good luck right you can set a

305
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,050
program policy you can set rules but

306
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,460
they're not contracted to you and any

307
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,199
means they're gonna do whatever they're

308
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,580
gonna do and you have to deal with the

309
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:42,480
outcome of that when when they send in

310
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:45,930
reports it could be an amazing 17 page

311
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,960
threat model with zero days and flaws

312
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,079
and architecture and amazingness or it

313
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,310
could just be a single payload and

314
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,200
nothing whiteness just blank screen it

315
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,060
can happen any time of the day and it is

316
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,010
happening all the time because people

317
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,160
are around the world we've got hackers

318
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:08,069
literally around the world so we're

319
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,540
always being hit by these guys and it

320
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,400
can cost then literally anything you

321
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,740
could have a program that spends no

322
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,350
money because you manage your software

323
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,750
internally you manage tickets and

324
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,220
everything you payout directly however

325
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,480
you're gonna do the same gift cards out

326
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,400
maybe your swag and who knows maybe

327
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,470
maybe you want to pay four hundred

328
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,980
thousand dollars for a single bug one

329
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,840
bug a year best bug gets get to the pot

330
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,910
right the cost is really what you have

331
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,990
available and what are the incentives

332
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,550
you want to set and the quality is gonna

333
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,840
vary by the individual not the company

334
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,459
that you're hiring because these are

335
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,170
individual people they're not they don't

336
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,750
work for a group in most cases so it's a

337
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,040
pen test but also very much not a pen

338
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,780
test so what do we call it usually we

339
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,089
just call it pen tell you know it's

340
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,400
really not but the reality lies

341
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,920
somewhere between the two and exactly

342
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,350
where is kind of is really a direct

343
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,349
function of the program that you build

344
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,610
and and every single person in a

345
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,560
security organization and the

346
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,240
development organizations

347
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,489
security development that worked

348
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,720
together to support the blood running

349
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:25,200
program because it can impact everything

350
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,000
in the company if you want it to the

351
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,140
researchers might identify flaws in the

352
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,060
design of the system that needs to give

353
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,210
react detected so the architects get

354
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,670
work I could prove it security control

355
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,339
doesn't work as intended and policy

356
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,490
needs to change so your GRC group has

357
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,970
has work to do they act kind of like a

358
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,170
red team sometimes without a schedule

359
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,540
Limited rules of engagement if any

360
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,729
depending on how the team works they

361
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,650
break things and act without the

362
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,640
knowledge of the general security team

363
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:59,069
or the development organization they can

364
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,360
also work on a schedule they can be

365
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,010
exactly what you need them to be

366
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,920
point-point the research is that a thing

367
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,290
and they will go hunt that down you can

368
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,969
plant events and then we know there's

369
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,219
gonna be people hacking on this thing at

370
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,770
this time right that's we can set a

371
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,660
schedule and when they produce reports

372
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,279
we can take those and hand them to

373
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,469
development and say here's the thing you

374
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,680
need to fix use how we reproduce it we

375
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,420
know that it exists let's fix it

376
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,560
together

377
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,439
does the direct thing that can be handed

378
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,319
over or maybe they're just setting off

379
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,000
alerts all over the network and the

380
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,250
teams that monitor the network are

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,940
seeing these things and we can alert on

382
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:44,339
them and protect against that statically

383
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,960
dynamically responsive or not so they

384
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,420
attack the system as a whole that cause

385
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,080
work for everybody everybody in security

386
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:56,640
everybody in development so you have to

387
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,650
respond as a whole and since the voice

388
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,550
can have impact everybody we need to get

389
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,980
everybody involved

390
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,609
our team has three major pieces to our

391
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,860
program right now business as usual the

392
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:11,938
void binary life cycle and life hacking

393
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:14,010
events so business as usual is just the

394
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,339
general idea of research as the ones

395
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,689
doing the work I kind of gotten is I I

396
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:21,000
mix up the word researchers and hackers

397
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:23,900
but they're kind of the same group of

398
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,849
people so it's just

399
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,110
I don't know sometimes was a positive or

400
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:31,010
negative connotation to one word or the

401
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:33,649
other try and be consistent but they

402
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:37,490
know what they are they know what they

403
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:39,440
are but they're the ones finding bugs

404
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,420
they write they write something in their

405
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,970
resembles a report and they send it in

406
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,640
to us you know and we we have some of

407
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,309
the best research in the world one of

408
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,750
one of our guys who focuses on a

409
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:56,809
particular type of bug he's I would say

410
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,720
the best at that kind of bug because

411
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,300
with the success he's shown he uses bug

412
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,980
bounty actually to fund three and

413
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,970
probably by this point maybe four he's

414
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,650
probably start another one different

415
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,080
businesses that he henan and his wife

416
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,090
run so he he does hacking on the side to

417
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,689
support all the other business ventures

418
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:18,379
that he has that's pretty cool we've got

419
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:22,820
one or two pairs of people that do pen

420
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:26,929
testing to develop tools and an ocean

421
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,700
and like actual AB SEC tools that they

422
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,220
prototype while they're doing hacking

423
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,650
and then we'll hand those off and sell

424
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,940
them to companies and other bug bounty

425
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,690
hunters to keep you know keep making

426
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,640
more money off of that

427
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:45,559
alright but we've got people to design

428
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,510
developing zero days in software we've

429
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,428
got people doing actually doing trout

430
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,129
models against our our stuff we've got

431
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,750
people finding cross-site scripting

432
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,660
payloads that just execute like it's

433
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,950
it's all over the place so they find a

434
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,290
bug and they write a report send it in

435
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,450
hacker one is our vendor that we use

436
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,280
right now we've there are our platform

437
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,610
for ticket management and payment

438
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,190
processing we also use their managed

439
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,500
service for initial triage of reports so

440
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,720
when report comes in they look at it see

441
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,910
if they can reproduce the steps add any

442
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,679
missing details so you know the end

443
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:26,330
result that they actually pass to us is

444
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,940
a nice clean quality report saves us a

445
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,649
ton of time and they're a fantastic team

446
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,360
we need a new feature in the platform

447
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,100
they put it on the backlog and they'll

448
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,929
start working on it

449
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,879
we need help getting data or building

450
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:41,090
reports they jump right in and find that

451
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,870
data for us whenever we can't we don't

452
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:47,300
have access to to finding it when we

453
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,280
want to run an event or cause a burst in

454
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,460
reports because we're gonna do something

455
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,899
like point people in the direction the

456
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,400
triage team is the first group that we

457
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,040
notify so that they can handle that

458
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,280
surge of activity and we've strained

459
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,280
them in the past year once it both been

460
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:08,840
triage it comes to us the paranoid bug

461
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,129
bounty team on the paranoids we you know

462
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,679
we go through the process of deciding

463
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,050
who needs to get involved in in this bug

464
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,330
it's usually adjust the developers but

465
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,399
maybe it's Incident Response maybe we

466
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,860
need to go ask the legal or privacy team

467
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,540
how do you classify this data right if

468
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,699
something something you know we're

469
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:31,280
looking at a string of data that came

470
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:34,130
out of out of a bug should that be more

471
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,170
protected is it ok where it's at even

472
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,230
though the bug that exists needs to get

473
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:42,140
fixed so we got to decide if we need to

474
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:47,660
build more engagement with with that

475
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:48,890
product so we'll figure out who needs to

476
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,830
get involved get those people involved

477
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,910
usually it's just the developers so

478
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,449
developers are the ones that are gonna

479
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,540
fix it we partner with them we'll help

480
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,950
design a fix we'll test it with them

481
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,810
sometimes we can even go to the point of

482
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,730
actually identifying lines of code and

483
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,639
specific fixes that that might need

484
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,310
doing so we can save them some time and

485
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,910
wherever possible we're happy to educate

486
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:16,280
and train and our goal was to less ship

487
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,050
security build it in right if we're

488
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,760
always just fixing point in time bugs

489
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:24,100
we're never really going to make

490
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,570
progress what our devs are the best they

491
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,459
the nthere they're absolutely the most

492
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,830
critical piece of the process if we

493
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,960
don't have support from them if they're

494
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,590
not engaged we're not fixing anything

495
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,490
right security team as even though a lot

496
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,030
of us come from an engineering

497
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,980
background

498
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,020
we're not the developers this is not our

499
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,000
code we can't just fix things we don't

500
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,920
know their pipeline we can't necessarily

501
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,700
deploy the fix even if we could fix the

502
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,320
code

503
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,559
so we need we need our developers

504
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,580
involved and with the hundreds and I

505
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,859
don't know how many thousands of

506
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,689
products that we have different text

507
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:59,629
acts that are all over the place

508
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,789
we have some of the best I think in the

509
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:04,070
world and because they're always excited

510
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,600
to see us showing up like when we when

511
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,730
we hand them bugs are always excited

512
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,039
like what's this new thing is this a new

513
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,700
new attack is this something different

514
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:16,730
what can I learn from that once the bug

515
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,909
is fixed our team will then go back

516
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:22,159
through the runn book and we'll work on

517
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:24,980
retesting it determine how much if any

518
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,539
award we're gonna grant and then

519
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,519
distribute that through the platform

520
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:31,999
back to the research and if all went

521
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,570
well researcher comes back to us with

522
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:38,769
new vulns down the road rinse repeat

523
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:42,470
simple one job hand it off

524
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:44,359
so next until we really decide that that

525
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:49,340
just kind of looks like outsourced pen

526
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:52,309
testing which it is right but it should

527
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,769
be more than that it can be more than

528
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:57,408
that and there's there's some groups in

529
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:01,460
the space that are designing bug bounty

530
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:02,869
to be outsourced pen testing and that's

531
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,059
that's kind of what you can pay for you

532
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:07,939
can pay for work you can pay for effort

533
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:11,869
but it can really be a lot more than

534
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,580
that on the inside so the other thing

535
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:15,439
that our team does is to take the

536
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,499
software development cycle used to build

537
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,539
software and this is not ours but just

538
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:25,730
generic process right you can apply that

539
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:27,379
to anything agile waterfall Princeton

540
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,700
and iterations like whatever the process

541
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:31,189
it kind of looks like that you got a

542
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,679
design it build it test it deploy well

543
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,269
we could turn that backwards and we call

544
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,369
it the bug bounty lifecycle it's the

545
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:39,830
idea that when a report comes in it

546
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:41,779
doesn't have to be just a single bug it

547
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,649
can actually cascade the fix back up the

548
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:49,700
chain and drive deeper wider changes

549
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:51,859
across tech so we get a payload that

550
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,019
executes some production probably just a

551
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:55,489
small fix one or two lines of code maybe

552
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:58,340
we add something to a black list or a

553
00:23:55,489 --> 00:24:04,359
white list push that out fixed done

554
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:06,649
simple five hours two hours four days

555
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,689
instead though we maybe want to back

556
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:11,449
that up by implementing a tool that we

557
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,929
can scan for that fit for that test case

558
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,580
or add a payload into an existing

559
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:20,570
scanner that we can look for something

560
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,489
we can build a test case maybe we go

561
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,330
back a little farther we identify enough

562
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:28,549
of those and find out we can build a new

563
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,980
library or implement some other library

564
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:34,940
into a particular product that's being

565
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:37,759
hit so we can fix that issue across the

566
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,700
whole codebase that product we can go

567
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:44,749
back a little farther to the architects

568
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,789
to maybe build a new control or adjust a

569
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,259
control that exists because it's not

570
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:50,090
working the way they did was designed or

571
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:52,039
it's not working it's working the way it

572
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:56,119
was designed but not being used the way

573
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:59,149
that it was designed or intended so

574
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,830
maybe something is just missing okay we

575
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:02,658
can go back even farther maybe and take

576
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,289
the lessons and write a new requirement

577
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:09,230
policy standard and then deploy that

578
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:15,289
across the entire product organization

579
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:17,749
fix that issue across everything could

580
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:21,049
be all off of a single report and in

581
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:22,460
some cases it is more likely though it's

582
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,349
off of a series of reports you see

583
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,820
someone attacking a product and they

584
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:27,529
attack this and then that and the next

585
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,689
thing and the next thing and we've

586
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,249
identified a chain of these are all

587
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,279
related vulnerabilities or delayed

588
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:35,749
attacks and now they've developed enough

589
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,429
knowledge about the application they can

590
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:39,859
take it to the next level and they find

591
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:42,409
the next thing and then we need to

592
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:46,999
really engage with different groups of

593
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:49,940
the development organization the last

594
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:54,619
piece of our program right now is life

595
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:59,269
hacking events it's it's the probably

596
00:25:54,619 --> 00:26:02,209
the most visible honestly so these these

597
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:05,419
events tend to take place over

598
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:09,019
usually a few days and the format's been

599
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:11,090
changing because of some some tests

600
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:14,210
we've been running it past few months or

601
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,820
so but we have a bunch of researchers

602
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:19,580
bunch of hackers come in to a particular

603
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,340
place we point them at a product or a

604
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,220
feature or maybe a particular plug that

605
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:29,090
we want to find and say do it

606
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,700
hit it find it test that thing and they

607
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,100
will write it's it's a sharp tool that

608
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,799
we can use to to focus on a particular

609
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,469
thing and the hackers use it to build

610
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,450
their community so they they love to

611
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,740
come together and spend time with each

612
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,409
other and see a new part of the world

613
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,019
because we we use it as an opportunity

614
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:50,450
to travel sometimes sometimes they like

615
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:52,340
to show off their skills and and like

616
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,749
prove to each other that that you know

617
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,999
I'm better than you because I can find

618
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:59,929
this bug and you can sometimes it's a

619
00:26:55,999 --> 00:27:02,299
competition but a lot of times they use

620
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:05,659
it the hackers used it hacker one uses

621
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:08,240
it and we as a program use it to train

622
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:13,249
new hackers or recruit them into our

623
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,749
security team some of you know we mark

624
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:17,119
Litchfield was one of them that we were

625
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:19,210
created onto our team other programs

626
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,379
were constantly trying to do that

627
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,950
because they've shown that they have

628
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:26,748
that skill they shown the ability to

629
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:29,299
write proof of our abilities this and

630
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:32,350
then depending on you know maybe maybe

631
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:34,309
maybe a particular person is better at

632
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,959
the fixing side of things they write

633
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:37,820
excellent reports and they're really

634
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,879
engaged throughout the entire lifecycle

635
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:44,658
of a bug so they provide all that extra

636
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:49,668
value so I got a couple quotes from from

637
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:51,009
hackers from some of our live events was

638
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:56,059
for sure one of the best days of my life

639
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:57,830
this was a guy that I'm not sure I don't

640
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:01,158
think he'd actually been participating

641
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:05,809
in a and bug bounty before this the

642
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:08,059
event that I met him at but you know

643
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,428
what one thing is for sure that everyone

644
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:12,499
enjoys a really well planned event you

645
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:15,139
know that the lion I like here is I will

646
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:15,980
be radically changing the way that I

647
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:19,189
hack

648
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,760
from now on that's a powerful statement

649
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,500
to hear from someone that you know we've

650
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,080
interfaced with online a few messages

651
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,650
here and there and now shaking hands in

652
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:34,428
an event we love to be part of these

653
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,169
events as a program and you know

654
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,950
particularly with our with hacker one

655
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:41,480
our our partner for these events because

656
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:45,110
you know and the feedback we've received

657
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,240
is just amazing we love it our vendor

658
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:52,459
seems to seems to love us showing up and

659
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:58,570
the hackers love it when we show up all

660
00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:00,620
right so that's what it is but how do we

661
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,590
how can you take some of that success

662
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:06,770
and emulate that or produce your own

663
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,090
program out of it well I called this

664
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:12,020
talk a formula but it's not really a

665
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,370
formula it's more a recipe tried to I

666
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,860
try to write a formula and it just

667
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,299
didn't make sense it's it's more of a

668
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,809
recipe because you have all these pieces

669
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:21,980
that come together and at different

670
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:24,168
times you need to emphasize different

671
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,850
different parts of it get different

672
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:27,980
flavors out of it but the whole thing

673
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,409
doesn't work if you're missing any of

674
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,900
them so we've got community and

675
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:36,350
integrity as some of the cornerstones

676
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:39,700
and of course money more money

677
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,320
probably more success probably but

678
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,880
embrace it earlier money is not a major

679
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:50,928
success but to the hackers it feels more

680
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:54,370
successful when they get paid so to

681
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:57,590
start the program need to have a core

682
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,719
single core guiding principle you might

683
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,820
call it a goal but I think of it more of

684
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,440
it as a principle instead goals are

685
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,928
something that can change over time as

686
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,840
you evolve it's something you can

687
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,070
achieve principle though is a higher

688
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,740
purpose it's something you can ask

689
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:15,590
yourself does this decision lead me

690
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,450
towards the principle towards our core

691
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,610
principle of the program am i making

692
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:22,610
progress in the right direction right

693
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:25,760
the principle is that direction so ours

694
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:28,389
was and still is we fight for our users

695
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,010
we are paranoid

696
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:34,309
we use our position on the internet to

697
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,809
fight for those that need it maybe they

698
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:38,690
can't fight themselves maybe they just

699
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:41,510
need help maybe they don't even know it

700
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:44,210
but we fight for our users that's ours

701
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,809
and really everyone's responsibility

702
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:52,370
as companies on the internet right we

703
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:54,049
have data we should protect it so maybe

704
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,149
you know that the goals are our

705
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:58,100
principle is going to manifest itself in

706
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,140
different goals at different times maybe

707
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:03,969
we want to set a goal to eradicate a

708
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:07,280
single bug from our entire company or

709
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:11,090
identify the most dangerous bug in each

710
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,350
product and fix those individually or

711
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,750
maybe we just want to build the new

712
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:17,480
technology and enable our users to

713
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:21,950
protect their own data within our

714
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,260
systems once the program has a direction

715
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,549
you need to get participants involved

716
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,010
executive sponsorship is critical we

717
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,780
hear this time and time again right you

718
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,940
can build grassroots you can go from the

719
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,700
bottom up but if you have buy-in from

720
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,730
the top down everything is way more

721
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:40,220
effective we've been so successful

722
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:43,280
because we actually have buy-in from our

723
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,250
CEO all the way down right when we have

724
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,710
our company meetings he's always making

725
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,270
comments about security is fantastic and

726
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,940
they're doing this and he should be

727
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:56,110
involved in that and he's constantly

728
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,919
supporting us which is incredible

729
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,969
obviously you'll need the researchers

730
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,370
who are the ones doing the work to find

731
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:05,210
the bugs they run tools against the

732
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:08,090
network buzz inputs testing web

733
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,669
applications hammer the api's generally

734
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:14,959
just work to expose the surface and find

735
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:16,100
the cracks primal part but when the bugs

736
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,860
start rolling in what do you do with

737
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,418
them are you fixing them yourselves do

738
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,580
you hand them off to a separate product

739
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:24,980
team whoever is responsible for fixing

740
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,710
the bugs has to be willing to accept

741
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,750
them from the program that's that

742
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,740
they're the most important part that

743
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,740
development group

744
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:42,799
so community is hyper important this is

745
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:45,379
actually a the end photo from one of our

746
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,910
live hacking events the guy in the front

747
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,030
there actually won the event he got the

748
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:54,980
most valuable hackers who he got a belt

749
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:57,020
right that's that's always fun but so

750
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:01,850
this this event was in Argentina last

751
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:03,918
year we flew down had I think the events

752
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,178
typically have around 50 people and a

753
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,730
break down for this one was a little

754
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:10,580
different because we had someone who was

755
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:13,549
starting a hacker meetup community in

756
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,960
the area and he reached out to hacker

757
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:18,440
one and said hey I'm trying to skip it

758
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,000
and started get this off the ground can

759
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,160
you guys help support us and they said

760
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,470
absolutely but how do you feel about

761
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:29,090
bringing a live event down to Argentina

762
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:32,270
so the breakdown for the event instead

763
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:37,850
of being 25 researchers and their plus

764
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:39,980
once it became 25 researchers and 15

765
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:44,178
from the local community that was being

766
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:46,190
started and then working working with us

767
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,230
we went to hacker one and said hey let's

768
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,780
do something another thing let's add a

769
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,880
CTF in because these events are

770
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,270
typically tied around hacker conferences

771
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,559
so this was this was a tech o party in

772
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,559
Buenos Aires

773
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,510
so hacker won't built a little CTF that

774
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,340
they ran at the conference and the

775
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,290
people that won got an invite to the

776
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,090
event right we can grow the community

777
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,320
it's a pretty interesting thing it was

778
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,050
an incentive to participate in the

779
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,780
challenge it's kind of a weird CTF but

780
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,609
everyone had fun and we got great bugs

781
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,710
from all three of the groups that showed

782
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:21,949
up a lot of them were actually new to

783
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,540
hacking in general like they come from a

784
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:25,699
pen test background or an engineering

785
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,159
background or whatever the case but

786
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:29,118
they've never really done web

787
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,310
application

788
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,669
hacking or you know most of them had

789
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:37,399
never done bug bounty hunting and yet we

790
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:39,949
still found a lot of success this is

791
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:42,859
actually the guy that's the best picture

792
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,418
I could get at them but this this was

793
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,509
captured we were having a like a really

794
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:48,540
intense conversation

795
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,179
I don't know what but it was great

796
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,820
because you know this was my first

797
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,730
experience four months after I learned

798
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,150
bug Valley joined the program started

799
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,890
taking everything started running it and

800
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,770
uh you know I knew all of these people

801
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:07,529
as user names I never met any of them

802
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,300
right they knew me as a user name as as

803
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,580
flying toasters and when flying toaster

804
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,680
shows up in the comments it's either

805
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,900
because he's handing out money or he's

806
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,089
gonna tell you that like bad news that

807
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,790
you know the bug you sent in is not a

808
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,550
critical bug it's a medium or a low

809
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,529
severity and or you know it's bad news

810
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,670
because we don't care about that now

811
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,490
that we don't care it's like that's not

812
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,440
an issue or our team is like this you

813
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:35,069
really just don't cover a feature that's

814
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:40,320
not a security problem so thanks for

815
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:42,180
playing or duplicates yeah right that

816
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,970
that's the other thing so so money or

817
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,520
bad news right and I knew all of them by

818
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,589
their user names so some of them I am

819
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,850
like super excited to read their reports

820
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,960
because they put a lot of detail in it

821
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,520
and it's a really interesting bug and

822
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,930
it's like new research I feel like I'm

823
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,680
learning something when I read them and

824
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:01,919
some of them add read because they're

825
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,129
hard to read or like I know that I'm

826
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,310
gonna have to give them bad news or they

827
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:11,040
just have a constant just they rate it

828
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:15,210
so high and it's never that high you

829
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,040
know but these events bring everyone

830
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:21,090
together and allow us to build those

831
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,540
relationships together so that now REO

832
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:28,290
is not a username he's a person right we

833
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:31,859
we use the Internet so frequently that

834
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:35,369
it's hard sometimes to get back to that

835
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:38,819
connection that these are real people

836
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:41,070
and we're working to fight for our users

837
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,390
but so are they right there they're out

838
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,760
there they were there working on our

839
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,990
products because maybe they really they

840
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,450
use our products they care about our

841
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:50,850
products some of them really just care

842
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:53,520
about our users and don't use the

843
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,618
products that's fine right there they're

844
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,160
helping us it's all it's all moving

845
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,160
towards the right direction

846
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:08,660
the next piece and I'm not a behavioral

847
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:11,330
psychologist but I've noticed throughout

848
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:14,000
my life that people live up to

849
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:16,369
expectations that you said so if you set

850
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,440
high expectations you know particularly

851
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:20,090
for yourself because the best you can do

852
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,950
you said it's not a high bar for

853
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:25,400
yourself and work to live up to that

854
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:28,430
people around you will see that and they

855
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,170
respect it and eventually hopefully they

856
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,700
start to reciprocate that they hold you

857
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:35,300
to act the patients they hope you get

858
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:37,910
there and if you circular yourself with

859
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:41,840
those people they also will begin to set

860
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:43,700
high expectations for themselves so this

861
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,869
should go without saying but I'll say it

862
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,839
anyways because it's incredibly

863
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:51,790
important in blood brownie but in

864
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:58,040
everything act with integrity always and

865
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:59,779
again act of integrity always as a part

866
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,910
of a bug bounty program represent

867
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:05,300
yourself your team your security

868
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:09,009
organization company your employee work

869
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,849
force to so many people and places and

870
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,150
that means that everything you do

871
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:16,910
matters not just like yeah everything I

872
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,589
do matters because I matter but

873
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:22,220
everything you view matters because it

874
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:25,910
matters like people see that people are

875
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,529
watching that often man that manifests

876
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,730
itself through integrity through sorry

877
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,550
integrity manifests itself through

878
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:35,240
honesty so a simple common example that

879
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:38,210
that I can think of is like the hackers

880
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,759
are gonna ask can you tell me more about

881
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:43,910
this I want to know details about that

882
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:48,369
this thing can you help me devise an ID

883
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:52,549
for this function so that I can bypass

884
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:54,109
brute-forcing and IDs can you tell me

885
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:56,450
what happened in that last feature

886
00:38:54,109 --> 00:39:00,529
update can you give me the code can you

887
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:03,230
give me the zone files and we find

888
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:06,740
ourselves in a situation where we're not

889
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:08,440
able or not allowed or just shouldn't

890
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,459
answer those questions

891
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:16,820
so we could say no or make something up

892
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,770
or lie but really the I would say the

893
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,940
right way to answer that is I can't

894
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,900
answer that because it's confidential

895
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:27,050
information period fact and a statement

896
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:30,020
let's move on right they push the bounds

897
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:31,910
they're natural red teamers right even

898
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,160
though they may not think about it that

899
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,379
way they're trying to social engineer at

900
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,220
all at every opportunity intentionally

901
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:46,790
or not so as as the program we have to

902
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:48,350
be defensive and and firm so we do our

903
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:52,730
best to make decisions that are fair and

904
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:54,049
line up with the program principle and

905
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,210
our experience has largely been that

906
00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:00,110
really no one who participates in bug

907
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:02,180
bounty programs acts with malice so

908
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:04,790
these are a couple of comments I've got

909
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,859
here that were logged in the bug binary

910
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:08,509
reports these come from hackers and it's

911
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,480
you know and a lot of the bowl history

912
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,950
comments when the hackers comments from

913
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,860
our team members comments comments

914
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:18,049
comments

915
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,130
let's cut you know was the last comment

916
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,270
helpful can I help in any other way

917
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,730
absolutely

918
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:26,330
it's always more you can do right but

919
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:28,970
they ask they care the MEAC would

920
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:32,060
disregard but you can preempt a lot of

921
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,919
that with the relationships usually it's

922
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,460
just mistakes that happen it's not

923
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,320
malice it's just whoops

924
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,870
researchers participate for all sorts

925
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,880
reason for money and fame the thrill of

926
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:46,160
the hunt and sometimes just because they

927
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:50,080
care about our products or consumers and

928
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,700
truly want to make our stuff more secure

929
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:57,440
and along the way bad things might

930
00:40:52,700 --> 00:41:00,140
happen well strike that actually bad

931
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,630
things will happen a trusting community

932
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,000
around the program will help you get

933
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,730
past those instances because when we act

934
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,690
with integrity the people we work with

935
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:14,930
feel obligated to do the same so this

936
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:17,390
was a situation actually we jump back

937
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:20,440
because this is another fun story this

938
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:23,480
one our

939
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,960
knock-knock one of our one of our

940
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,550
monitoring teams called us up in the

941
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,910
middle of the night and said something's

942
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:34,220
going on we need help and it turns out

943
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:39,259
we just had a hacker who was running his

944
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:42,049
tools and it was causing some chaos so

945
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,910
we tracked it down figured out who it

946
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,740
was sent a message and said hey I need

947
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,270
you to stop right now this is this is

948
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,890
causing some trouble what are you doing

949
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,660
right submit us a report with the

950
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,580
details of what you were doing where

951
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,310
you're going for what did you find

952
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:58,069
and just like stop until we tell you to

953
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,330
go right so he sent in the report and he

954
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,180
followed it up with this with this

955
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,340
comment that was you know sorry I didn't

956
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,200
mean to cause any damage like happy to

957
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,610
help with whatever I can I'm not gonna

958
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,210
touch that thing again until you tell me

959
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:13,820
to write and then they do that because

960
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,950
we've built our relationship there's

961
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:19,700
other instances where we don't have that

962
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:22,129
relationship in place and they just burn

963
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,379
the whole thing down keep going keep

964
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:27,440
going keep going until it breaks and

965
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,060
then we get a report and now we have a

966
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,070
whole mess to deal with

967
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:35,540
rather than we can stop it as it's

968
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:38,330
happening this one was was a little

969
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:42,890
different it was he actually identified

970
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:44,509
the issue like found a problem and then

971
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,790
identified a way that it could be

972
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,340
escalated and instead of going and doing

973
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:52,480
that which is against the rules right

974
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:55,160
that's we look at that as pivoting

975
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,930
leveraging one vulnerability to test and

976
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,670
find others he stops sent us a report

977
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,440
where we had and included the whole

978
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,450
little mini report about here's what I

979
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,950
think could happen if these conditions

980
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,799
hold but I'm not going to do that

981
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:12,830
because it violates the rules and and

982
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,930
and so you know we work with him and

983
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:16,069
said thanks for stopping like we

984
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,520
appreciate that you were staying within

985
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:20,930
the rules and communicating with us you

986
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,610
know maybe we actually do want to work

987
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,700
together and let him go test this and

988
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:29,860
set up a particular individual pen test

989
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,859
kind of self-contained experience

990
00:43:30,009 --> 00:43:35,319
maybe we want to just say no stop that's

991
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:39,219
done maybe the application was planning

992
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:41,589
on being yelled in four weeks and it's

993
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:48,219
not really worth his time or our effort

994
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:50,619
so thanks but move on right but without

995
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:52,950
that without stopping and thinking about

996
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:57,519
that and respecting the relationship

997
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:59,618
it's just another fern system and it's a

998
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:05,828
bad experience and now we have someone

999
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:07,180
who's broken our rules and Trust is one

1000
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:09,369
of the most important currencies that we

1001
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:12,009
have with our researchers with our

1002
00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:15,099
developers and obviously with the

1003
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:17,019
executives right researchers are going

1004
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:18,789
to follow the rules developers are going

1005
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:21,640
to be happy and engage with us when we

1006
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:26,589
bring them reports any executives

1007
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,890
support everything that we do trusts

1008
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:32,170
them is important with everybody this

1009
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:37,058
this is like one of the quintessential

1010
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:40,150
trust statements built in and drops and

1011
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:42,579
lost in buckets it it takes a long time

1012
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:44,440
it's every every comment every payout

1013
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:48,160
every interaction every phone call every

1014
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:52,539
meeting every email that slowly adds

1015
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,788
that trust when we act with with visible

1016
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:57,549
repetition that we're following our

1017
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:59,069
guiding principle that we're moving in

1018
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:06,788
the right direction

1019
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:08,288
with our researchers so the Aqua

1020
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:11,499
consistency requires some documentation

1021
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:12,069
and might argue that occupation should

1022
00:45:11,499 --> 00:45:15,038
come first

1023
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:16,299
I don't think it needs to it should it

1024
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,640
probably should but it doesn't really

1025
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:20,650
have to you you could operate with

1026
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,618
everything entirely inside the heads of

1027
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,930
your team members and that probably

1028
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:28,299
won't be consistent for very long unless

1029
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:32,229
you're some sort of super intelligent

1030
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:35,229
hive minded being but I suppose it is

1031
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:37,210
possible but no I really probably

1032
00:45:35,229 --> 00:45:39,249
quickly realized that it's useful to

1033
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,289
write down the important things how do

1034
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:42,669
you accept bug submissions do you notify

1035
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:45,910
anybody besides the development

1036
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,410
when a bug comes in who when is there a

1037
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,420
special process for handing bugs to

1038
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,910
developers is it different for different

1039
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,980
teams other rules that the researchers

1040
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:56,560
need to follow what happens if the rules

1041
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:58,870
get broken what information do you need

1042
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,220
to request for the researchers does your

1043
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:03,339
team add anything else to that

1044
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:06,339
information when do you qualify a bug is

1045
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,050
fixed how do you track all the reports

1046
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,180
that come in are you awarding

1047
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:13,480
researchers how do you determine what

1048
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:16,120
they receive probably gonna need some

1049
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,180
money to get the ball rolling especially

1050
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,950
if you decide to award researchers back

1051
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,290
in the day we actually a AOL had a

1052
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:26,859
program that worked the way many others

1053
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:29,340
did at the time which was thanks for

1054
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:34,330
submitting we'll put your user name on a

1055
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:38,140
Hall of Fame web page and that worked at

1056
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:39,819
the time enough but to stay competitive

1057
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,430
you really have to keep the attention of

1058
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:45,430
the best researchers out there so that's

1059
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:47,589
gonna cost some money if you want to use

1060
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:49,899
a vendor for you know platform or

1061
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,340
services that's gonna cost if you have

1062
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,550
dedicated resources to operate the

1063
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,740
program staff members aren't free maybe

1064
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,080
you want a mell of t-shirts cotton ink

1065
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:02,859
stamps that's gonna set you back a bit

1066
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,360
especially over time and I actually

1067
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,130
recommend setting bounties for

1068
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:11,140
particular bugs that you want to see

1069
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:13,420
reported there's kind of a twist on the

1070
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,129
Field of Dreams adage and in the world

1071
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,830
of bug bounties which if you pay them

1072
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,200
they will succeed if you point them in

1073
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:23,920
the direction and offer money they will

1074
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:26,470
find that thing this was some swag that

1075
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,720
we had at a recent event the little

1076
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,069
buttons find me later I can show it to

1077
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,660
you but a little button that like

1078
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,550
bluetooth to your phone and you could

1079
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,859
change anything that's on it they were a

1080
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:40,750
ton of fun they were actually bartering

1081
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:43,630
with those at RSA to like get invites of

1082
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:46,080
things it was it was really I mean

1083
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,080
amusing

1084
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:53,580
the are our second year at h1 4 & 5

1085
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,109
which is hacker 1 name names they're

1086
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,240
advanced based on the area code that

1087
00:47:55,110 --> 00:48:00,360
they're the events happening in so 4 1 5

1088
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:03,810
so this is San Francisco a couple months

1089
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:06,480
ago we offered a massive bonus for a

1090
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:09,000
particular bug we were bringing a

1091
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,670
product to the event and along with that

1092
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,110
product we brought we wanted to test

1093
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,300
some of our security controls that we

1094
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:18,920
had and we said if you can find this

1095
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,940
particularly will offer a $50,000 bonus

1096
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,370
we're not gonna say that we're not gonna

1097
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,250
prescribe what the bug is but we're

1098
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:28,950
gonna say if you get this result

1099
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:32,910
whatever bug came with it plus 50 grand

1100
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:37,950
so this was the $7000 bug with a $50,000

1101
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:40,740
bonus and you know we had we had over 30

1102
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,810
people working on it and in the end two

1103
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,709
guys who who had you know partnered up

1104
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:48,870
ended up solving it and won the bonus

1105
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:51,810
but really it's our program that won our

1106
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:54,540
consumers our customers are more secure

1107
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:58,920
because they all worked and it worked

1108
00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:00,680
together to find that bug the format's

1109
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,230
actually already been copied a few times

1110
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,299
and I expect it will continue because it

1111
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,490
really drove that was it was a massive

1112
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:13,800
incentive and it drove engagement down a

1113
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:17,549
particular path but in general we define

1114
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:19,890
a bounty table that says we will pay 100

1115
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:22,410
to 500 dollars for low severity bugs 15

1116
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,970
thousand for critical bugs and all the

1117
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,600
rest of the tween you can be more

1118
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,049
specific

1119
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,220
some programs are we actually list we

1120
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,160
have another table that matches this

1121
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,959
that lists

1122
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,569
payouts our list severity ranges for

1123
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,040
particular bugs and there's a mix of

1124
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:40,290
outcomes and vulnerabilities and

1125
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,750
exploits and things but we list the

1126
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:44,160
severity with the vulnerability so you

1127
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,080
can kind of track that back and say

1128
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,990
alright well remote code execution is

1129
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:51,980
critical or critical was 10 to 15 so

1130
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:54,419
remote code execution is 10 to 15 right

1131
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,700
and we actually have another column in

1132
00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:00,360
this table that we don't publish that

1133
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:02,549
says standardly in general we will pay

1134
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,650
X amount of dollars for each of these

1135
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:07,770
bug types we don't publish that though

1136
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:09,840
because that would then hold us to an

1137
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,880
accountability stance if we say we're

1138
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,790
always gonna pay this amount for this

1139
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,530
bug then whenever we deviate from that

1140
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,300
we end up with an argument right we're

1141
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:20,700
breaking trust with our researchers

1142
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:24,330
because we're now violating that that

1143
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,710
contract that we've said but so not

1144
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,110
publishing it gives it a little bit of

1145
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:31,320
flexibility because maybe the same bug

1146
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:33,420
and a different product is not as bad

1147
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,360
right it's the product is not as

1148
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,700
meaningful in some cases or the impact

1149
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,590
of that bug in the other product is not

1150
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:43,259
as valuable there's maybe no data in a

1151
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:45,000
marketing site so sequel injection just

1152
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,040
allows you to change the content you're

1153
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,600
not pulling any data out of there any

1154
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,830
meaningful data it's not publicly

1155
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:55,830
available already maybe you know we want

1156
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:58,020
to offer bonuses and we regularly do for

1157
00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:01,080
quality reports like really well-written

1158
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,420
content or unique research that's being

1159
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:06,960
that's happening there's all sorts of

1160
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:08,780
ways to play with that so you want to

1161
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,890
want to be transparent about it but not

1162
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:17,790
overly transparent now the last piece is

1163
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:20,460
challenge your assumptions we think live

1164
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:22,259
hacking has to be a certain format bring

1165
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,360
hackers out point amend a thing

1166
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:27,210
pay them go home but it doesn't have to

1167
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,880
be just that it can be a lot more and in

1168
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:34,890
we ran an event in New York and we the

1169
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:38,280
Royal we are vendor and us hacker one we

1170
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:40,620
are Arvind New York we ran some

1171
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,110
statistics on on our program identified

1172
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,509
these statistically most valuable

1173
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:47,100
hackers like you know people that have

1174
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:50,700
received the most money people that have

1175
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:52,799
received the most average money per

1176
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,830
report the most reports submitted most

1177
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,660
liked highest severity reports like

1178
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:00,540
match all those things up and we can

1179
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,210
create a statistic of these are our most

1180
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:05,550
impactful hackers bring them to an event

1181
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:07,290
and we actually put them on teams this

1182
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,910
time which should not really been done

1183
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,980
before it's been tried out here and

1184
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,899
there hackers were allowed to form teams

1185
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,050
to work together but in this instance we

1186
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,050
actually put

1187
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:19,600
on teams so we had eight teams of 432

1188
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,950
hackers some of them were super excited

1189
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,680
some of them were like I don't want to

1190
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:24,879
do teams this is not gonna be fun and

1191
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,060
walking out every single one of them

1192
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,880
said this was amazing this is fun format

1193
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:35,350
it was I learned from the team members I

1194
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:39,850
learned from other teams and it was just

1195
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:41,380
generally amazing feedback and you know

1196
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:44,170
we think that researchers aren't gonna

1197
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:47,140
find bugs in products that have already

1198
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,970
been attacked for years another you know

1199
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:52,000
we actually had in New York we did a

1200
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:54,549
multi-day format so normally product

1201
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,930
shows up for a day and there's there's

1202
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,880
some lead time and then there's a day of

1203
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:59,710
hacking and then people go home but we

1204
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,220
actually did this up as a multi-day

1205
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:05,710
format so we had lead up to one day and

1206
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,939
then at the end of the day we said okay

1207
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:08,770
we're gonna actually gonna add some new

1208
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,050
stuff we're gonna add a new product that

1209
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:13,150
no one has ever touched before hack on

1210
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:16,360
that will give you a day of recon

1211
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:18,610
instead of two weeks and then we had a

1212
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:23,770
second day of hacking on day three of

1213
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:25,180
the event and we got some amazing bugs

1214
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,130
we got amazing bugs for the new product

1215
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:29,140
but we also got amazing bugs for the

1216
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:32,830
other products stuff we brought to day

1217
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:34,240
one which had been around it's been

1218
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,860
those things had been in our program

1219
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,169
publicly available

1220
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:41,800
they weren't behind invites they were

1221
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:43,120
just out there for years and years and

1222
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,010
everyone has this assumption that

1223
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,130
everybody looked at it I'm not gonna

1224
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:50,170
find anything it's not accurate you will

1225
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:52,030
find something if you look right you're

1226
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,680
never gonna find it you don't but even

1227
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:55,870
if you've looked at it in the past

1228
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,240
you've got new tools you've got more

1229
00:53:55,870 --> 00:54:00,910
skills you've got different experiences

1230
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,290
now than you did in the past maybe you

1231
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,690
see something that looks exactly the

1232
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:07,300
same but you recognize a different piece

1233
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:10,270
of it because of other experience you've

1234
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:12,190
had or you can partner with someone that

1235
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:13,420
you've met along the way and ask them

1236
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:18,550
hey I think this is weird

1237
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:20,710
what do you see so we have all these

1238
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:23,410
assumptions and just

1239
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:27,930
keep testing them and we get some

1240
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:30,399
incredible changes as it so to wrap up

1241
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:32,859
talk a bit about how a bug bounty

1242
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,099
program should be used to fill gaps it's

1243
00:54:32,859 --> 00:54:37,680
not a replacement for anything and if

1244
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:39,790
you're going to start a program or

1245
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,009
evolve an existing program make sure

1246
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:48,550
you've got a well-defined principle at

1247
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:50,200
the core we fight for our users this

1248
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,660
sort of all know what kind of goes into

1249
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,730
making a good program but you need to

1250
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,129
find the right amounts of each piece to

1251
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:59,890
really make your program successful in

1252
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,030
the way that you want it and and invest

1253
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:03,580
in the community that supports your

1254
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:07,510
program and I'll say it again act with

1255
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,830
integrity always and then you know if

1256
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:11,890
you kind of move forwards bug money

1257
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,880
right now is it feels extremely volatile

1258
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,770
I don't know if that's accurate or not

1259
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,359
but that's my assessment of it is the

1260
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:19,630
whole space feels like it's moving

1261
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:23,440
really fast it's changing at a rapid

1262
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:25,990
pace so you know again this is what we

1263
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:31,240
know at the time things might change in

1264
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:33,430
the future and I just want to while I

1265
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,919
have the stage thank Jason boobala Jana

1266
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:38,980
Geddes when I joined the boy granting

1267
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:42,310
program just about a year ago May first

1268
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:45,940
last year I literally knew nothing I on

1269
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:47,859
the plane out there I like from Virginia

1270
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:50,369
to California I read Jason's white paper

1271
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:52,630
and then I sat with Jana for seven days

1272
00:55:50,369 --> 00:55:54,930
how does it work and that was my

1273
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:58,570
experience like and now here we are

1274
00:55:54,930 --> 00:56:00,069
right with with some amazing stuff

1275
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,260
everything since then to the paint

1276
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:09,700
series of trial and error calculated

1277
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:13,210
trials and manageable errors what oh you

1278
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:16,480
want the white paper here yes there's a

1279
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:18,280
whole bunch of reference stuff some blog

1280
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:24,570
posts and things white papers on there

1281
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,570
and the pastebin oh the white paper

1282
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:30,830
yeah it's called bug bounty programs

1283
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:33,230
enterprise implementation oh sorry yeah

1284
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:34,730
it's it's it's a pretty easy read it's

1285
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:39,380
kind of a lot of the same stuff that

1286
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:43,490
I've been saying but oh yeah yeah no

1287
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:47,240
worries I don't know do we have time

1288
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:50,649
left not really okay if you have

1289
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,649
questions find me later
