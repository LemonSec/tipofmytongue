1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
Greybeard been doing working on Linux

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,048
machines since before I was born the

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:13,769
exits at the rear this talk is not for

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:15,299
you I have nothing to offer you so but

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,009
for everybody that's trying to get into

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:22,230
the industry or maybe wants to see how

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:28,019
at least how I think the best way to do

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:30,448
that is then so yeah if you have several

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,640
years and in the industry it's not for

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,640
you this is for students this is for

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:42,450
perfect yeah teachers teachers are

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,190
welcome most important thing I can

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:51,149
stress for teachers is that written

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,980
tests are almost useless so you need a

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,960
computer lab whether or not you know you

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:00,538
need a computer lab you need a computer

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:05,339
lab so the best advice I can give when

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:09,270
getting started in cyber is it's not

19
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,650
sink or swim everyone has that one thing

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,030
that they're really good at and then a

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,950
little bit of knowledge everywhere else

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,680
if someone comes up to you and says that

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,990
their master of everything they you know

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,189
they're absolutely the best at every

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,060
single part of cyber they're wrong or

26
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:28,880
Google has released some new AI so you

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,470
just you have to be patient you have to

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,199
start small and work your way up nobody

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,930
started knowing absolutely everything

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,409
about whatever field they work in so the

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,890
next most common thing that people

32
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:50,729
complain about at least to me I want to

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,829
settle that debate here now forever okay

34
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,780
this is not Windows versus Mac versus

35
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,779
Linux everyone is going to tell you

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,939
something different okay in my

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,250
experience the best computer that you

38
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,139
need to get started is the one that you

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:11,099
already have you do not need to go out

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,319
and buy a new computer for learning

41
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,319
cyber I do not

42
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,268
understand why people say oh well you

43
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,119
know I'd really like to get I'd really

44
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,219
like to get started in cyber but I just

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,689
need a better computer if your computer

46
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:31,170
has a web browser that's like 99% of

47
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:33,810
what you need all right now that being

48
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,000
said I do recommend if you are going if

49
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,189
you are in the market for a computer you

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,930
probably want quad-core you probably

51
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,629
want a little bit of RAM that is

52
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,609
specifically for virtualization you do

53
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,439
not have to do that there are plenty of

54
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:49,980
resources online where if people will

55
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,709
host whatever you need for you that

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,569
being said we will get into that later

57
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:57,030
[Music]

58
00:02:53,569 --> 00:03:00,540
so this is a little word cloud of all of

59
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:05,790
the buzzwords that I usually encounter

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:08,010
in marketing pitches and it's scary it

61
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,358
you know it's it's really difficult to

62
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,939
see where should I get started right I

63
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:16,919
the biggest thing I can stress is you

64
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,620
want to start small and you want to work

65
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,030
your way up right but when you have all

66
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,699
these crazy buzzwords being thrown

67
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,840
around how are you supposed to know

68
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,659
which one to pick how are you supposed

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,180
to know where to get started right and

70
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:34,500
so that's sort of the meat and potatoes

71
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,090
of the talk is where where do you take

72
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,470
this apart where do you draw the line

73
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,419
and say all right enough of the

74
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,599
marketing terms we're going to

75
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,919
blockchain the cloud ai2 you know give

76
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,399
me money are you still paying attention

77
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,400
okay good we're gonna try and cut

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,590
through all that noise and and come up

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,659
with you know a curriculum to get

80
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:01,229
started so the absolute basics is how to

81
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:03,719
computer like if you if you are one of

82
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:05,540
those people that need your grandson to

83
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,709
help you check your email

84
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:13,798
you really have to handle that first

85
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:15,719
once once you've got a handle over how

86
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,320
your computer functions whether it's Mac

87
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,120
Linux Windows updates patches that kind

88
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,500
of thing how to just use your computer

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,630
have a general understanding of how that

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,040
file system works however though that

91
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,290
underlying

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,770
mechanisms work then you really want to

93
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,960
learn into the OSI model and I know

94
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,390
everyone who has had a college computer

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,180
science in here is rolling their eyes oh

96
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,539
great we have to go through this again

97
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,580
I'm gonna try and see I know I know

98
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,810
there was a test question on it wasn't

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,750
there several yeah please do not throw

100
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:58,980
away sausage pizza or sausage pizza one

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:05:01,260
of those yeah well once so once you get

102
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,960
a hand handle of the OSI model what it

103
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:09,950
is the OSI model is in a sense how

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:13,169
things communicate in most models right

105
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,400
so in order to kind of have a better

106
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,880
understanding of that I'm going to show

107
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,919
it in a second you really need to have a

108
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,550
good handle on networking at least like

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,110
the very very basic oh my computer can

110
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,300
talk to this other thing which is

111
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,950
basically another computer and then it

112
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,740
talks to someone else that's how I send

113
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,330
an email right and then you sort of want

114
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,800
to get into virtualization and learn how

115
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,419
to simulate those environments once you

116
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,010
get a little bit more advanced have a

117
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:45,120
nice like secure sandbox to sort of take

118
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,400
stuff apart and work with so here is the

119
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,080
OSI model I'm sure you've seen the slide

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,349
before I'm sorry

121
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,349
any flashbacks panic attacks whatever

122
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,610
PTSD triggers whatever trigger warning

123
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:05,969
this is the next two slides the OSI

124
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,700
model is really you don't need to know

125
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:11,220
every single layer exactly and how each

126
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,330
portent protocol works you don't need to

127
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,410
know that what you really need to know

128
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:19,200
is a general understanding of oh this is

129
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,900
where it turns into this is where it

130
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,479
goes from software to network which is

131
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,190
that that heart of the OSI the transport

132
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,110
layer this is where it leaves my

133
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,210
computer in software and then this is

134
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,540
where it hits it in Hardware most

135
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,370
exploits if you have some kind of

136
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,950
exploit at the CTF they're gonna ask

137
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,600
well what layer of exploit is it is this

138
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,550
a network exploit is

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,460
this a man-in-the-middle that's Network

140
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,460
- is this some kind of JavaScript the

141
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,710
type exploit sequel injection type thing

142
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,109
okay that's definitely the software side

143
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,060
of things or you know is there a

144
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,790
vulnerable package in whatever lengths

145
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,860
or is there an outdated version of SSH

146
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,020
or telnet or something listening on a

147
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,700
port that's definitely hardware and so

148
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,320
you sort of want to get at least a

149
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,300
general idea of where all of these where

150
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,969
all of these exploits happen and why

151
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,320
they're there and what everything is for

152
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:23,160
if that makes sense

153
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:27,659
right any questions so far on the OSI

154
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:35,580
model or the general the general idea of

155
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:38,370
what I'm trying to get that tcp/ip model

156
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,680
it's more technical and I feel like the

157
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:44,030
OSI model gives a better overview of how

158
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,690
things happen right so say I want to

159
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,909
send a send like a telegram message or

160
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,640
if I want to just send an IM from me to

161
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,070
you okay well there's software that has

162
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,500
that client and that message is composed

163
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,420
there then it's transported that's the

164
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,100
important part this is in route in the

165
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,860
network right so that's where all your

166
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,930
network attacks happen and then it's on

167
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,750
the server it's being computed by the

168
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:13,350
server that message is then relayed to

169
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:17,010
you right so I feel like the OSI model

170
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:20,340
more directly Maps to attack paths for

171
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,490
exploits that makes sense at the very

172
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,909
least in in this sort of three layer

173
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,180
broken up segment of where does that

174
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,300
exploit happen and why is it happening

175
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:38,780
is that sort of answer your question

176
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:38,780
anybody else no takers all right

177
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:46,730
all right so one of the biggest things

178
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,119
that you need to know if you're getting

179
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:53,510
into cyber is networks because literally

180
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,779
everything is networked everything your

181
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:00,160
phone your computer your your email

182
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:04,040
server all of its somewhere in the cloud

183
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,790
right the cloud does not exist it's not

184
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,680
real it is a marketing ploy right all of

185
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,149
its just networks all of its just

186
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,430
computers hooked up to those networks

187
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:15,139
they're all talking to each other so you

188
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,699
need to know what's an IP address

189
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,620
what's the MAC address what's the

190
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:20,329
difference why do I need to know the

191
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,339
difference why are that what are they

192
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,589
used for

193
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:27,410
right and so who wants to answer some of

194
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,649
these questions I'm if no one volunteers

195
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:37,610
I will start picking random members the

196
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:39,410
audience you look like you know what the

197
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,000
difference between a port and a protocol

198
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,620
sitting right there in the front row

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,850
no shaking your head no no come on tell

200
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,760
me the difference between a port or

201
00:09:46,850 --> 00:10:04,639
protocol I'm gonna keep picking on you

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:10:06,170
until you answer the question it's the

203
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,430
only one I could give without being

204
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,699
inappropriate I'm pretty sure they're

205
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,569
recording us so if we're gonna go over a

206
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:16,370
quick networking in five minutes

207
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:18,019
IP addresses are gonna be that

208
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,709
software-defined a dress that's gonna be

209
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:23,870
designated by your network stack

210
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:26,180
whenever you connect to the hotel Wi-Fi

211
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:30,800
which you should not do because it is

212
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,479
awful in many many ways that that

213
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,180
network stack is going to give you an IP

214
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,589
address more often than not and if

215
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,380
someone has a network that doesn't have

216
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,209
a DHCP server on it and they tell you

217
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,319
it's because of security they're wrong

218
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:45,560
they're just that don't know what

219
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:48,170
they're doing the MAC address is going

220
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,599
to be your actual Hardware address of

221
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,010
the computer that's not gonna change yes

222
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,710
you can spoof it we're not getting into

223
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:58,540
that it's fine

224
00:10:53,710 --> 00:11:00,610
get it ports and protocols so there's a

225
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,310
whole bunch of ports all you need to

226
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,100
know is that they're basically doors

227
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,869
right something has you have to open a

228
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,910
port for me to send traffic to it you

229
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:17,020
have to be listening on that port to

230
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:18,850
accept that traffic protocols are and I

231
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,770
struggle to say this in a room full of

232
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,980
people that are probably smarter than me

233
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:26,079
but protocols are basically useless

234
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,050
they're sort of community defined

235
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,490
standards of how that connection happens

236
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:36,939
and people like to conflate the two

237
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:41,050
right so like Oh port 22 is open that

238
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,340
means they're running SSH no no that's

239
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,060
not what that means that means that port

240
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,770
22 is open most commonly they're gonna

241
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,469
be running SSH but there's nothing

242
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,810
stopping you from running MongoDB

243
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,480
listening on port 22 you can do whatever

244
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,810
you want I have a friend of mine that

245
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,990
firmly believes that he needs to run SSH

246
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:10,959
on the telnet port of every machine just

247
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:13,090
to mess with people I mean like it's

248
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,780
it's just one of those things where if

249
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:19,420
you if someone scanning your network

250
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,640
sees port 23 and they start throwing

251
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,920
telnet packets at it and tell net

252
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,470
attacks at it and that's all that that's

253
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,939
the farthest they get I'm fine with that

254
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:39,460
because they clearly don't know what's

255
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:41,800
going on hmm well you would think I mean

256
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,420
most college freshmen probably don't

257
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,000
know the difference they're just gonna

258
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,979
see port 22 open and assume it's SSH

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,620
they're gonna see port what is it 3 3 8

260
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,640
9 4 RDP Jesus there's so many already

261
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,130
for you to exploit but we're not gonna

262
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,350
get into that and then here here's going

263
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:00,280
back to what you were saying earlier TCP

264
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,950
IP UDP the really what you need to know

265
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,120
is most traffic you're gonna look at is

266
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,950
TCP like 99% of it if it's UDP

267
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,180
they're doing something odd or it's

268
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:14,920
either a video game or Netflix probably

269
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,949
that's pretty much all you need to know

270
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,449
about that there when whenever you have

271
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,760
a TCP connection there's an actual

272
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,190
connection that is established there's a

273
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,120
three-way handshake that goes on

274
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,190
certificates are exchanged if they're

275
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,390
doing security and that's that session

276
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,910
is what you're gonna be looking on the

277
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,430
Wireshark for UDP they're just gonna

278
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,199
kind of throw packets at you and hope

279
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,779
that they get there maybe in the right

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,850
order who knows but for security

281
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,230
purposes I wouldn't worry about it too

282
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,180
much

283
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,370
it's it's just a whole rabbit hole that

284
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,810
you can go down and it's not where

285
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,250
you're gonna see in the field like most

286
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:54,250
of the time and so here we get into my

287
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,589
actual expertise the part of the talk

288
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,770
that you have been waiting for probably

289
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:04,600
is so a little bit of background about

290
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:07,839
me I built cyber ranges I built virtual

291
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,020
cyber ranges for the National Guard so I

292
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,450
stood up and fully populated Class A

293
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,819
networks full of vulnerable machines

294
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,430
wrote curriculum to exploit them

295
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,560
documented all that packaged it up for

296
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,949
the National Guard to use for their

297
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,910
cyber training exercises all right and

298
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:31,300
so this is where I believe most of your

299
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:34,569
learning is gonna come in and what I

300
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,779
mean by that is if you have a computer

301
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,339
and you understand virtualization in any

302
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,520
affect even if you're just running

303
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,130
VirtualBox even if you just know docker

304
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,790
the the amount of things that you can do

305
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,680
and the achieve all you mugs that you

306
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:54,040
can learn with that technology at your

307
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,290
fingers far outstrips what you would get

308
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,860
from reading a textbook following a blog

309
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:02,500
post looking at reddit right I feel like

310
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,570
hands-on experience is the most

311
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,400
important thing whenever you're learning

312
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,560
cyber and virtualization is how you're

313
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,270
gonna be able to do that because not

314
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,979
everybody's gonna be able to stand up

315
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,800
ten different computers hook them up to

316
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,450
a physical switch and then start sending

317
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,199
traffic back and forth and try to

318
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:22,170
virtualize a really small office Network

319
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,569
and if you do virtualization right even

320
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,238
on even on that little razor blade there

321
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:29,219
in the back I see you yeah even on even

322
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:32,279
on your little ultrabook you can run

323
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:40,079
what probably 50 VMs and be fine

324
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:42,179
yeah so virtualization is probably one

325
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,589
of the most more complex things but I

326
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,869
think that's a good place to start

327
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,730
because it will again let you learn a

328
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:51,540
whole bunch more so let's get into that

329
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,459
a little bit so you're mainly gonna have

330
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,049
two kinds of hypervisors whenever

331
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:59,069
somebody's talking about a hypervisor

332
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:00,899
right and most often they're going to

333
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:04,649
somebody's gonna say oh I'll just spin

334
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:07,249
up a VM right well that's gonna be your

335
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:09,839
layer three on top of the operating

336
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:12,509
system that's gonna be your VirtualBox

337
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,549
that's gonna be your VMware fusion or

338
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:16,619
player whatever you're on whatever

339
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:19,709
version you're on and it's gonna be

340
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:22,980
really slow and it's going to be slow

341
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:26,069
because it has to virtualize an entire

342
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,399
kernel for an operating system on top of

343
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:32,399
the kernel that you are already running

344
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,459
right and for every VM you have to

345
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,449
virtualize that individual kernel so if

346
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:42,779
I spin up ten computers with a standard

347
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:45,359
type what is a three standard type three

348
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:47,309
hypervisor then I'm actually running 11

349
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,600
computers that's why I write in the very

350
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,480
beginning when I said what kind of

351
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,220
computer do you need you don't but if

352
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,579
you have a quad-core and you have a

353
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,319
little bit of RAM you can run more than

354
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:59,969
just a couple of yemm's and you can

355
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:02,939
really build it out you don't need it

356
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,740
there are better ways to do it but

357
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,769
that's what I would recommend just for

358
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,380
getting started there's pros and cons of

359
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:12,179
running different kinds of VMs so if you

360
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,339
have like an old dedicated computer and

361
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,419
you slap ESX on it that's probably gonna

362
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,010
be one of the biggest learning

363
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,949
experiences for you so that's gonna be a

364
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,359
type 2 hypervisor that's gonna be on

365
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,309
metal that's dedicated hardware that is

366
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,378
designed to just run your virtual

367
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:30,330
machines to just run your lab at your

368
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:32,540
house all right and that's where you're

369
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:36,470
gonna get the most

370
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,810
volume per performance if that makes any

371
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,450
sense so like if you just have a regular

372
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,000
laptop and you're running Windows 10

373
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,370
whatever patch version it's on you can

374
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,680
spin up a couple VMs and you can do fine

375
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:52,580
if you have that same computer running

376
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:56,960
an ESX cluster you can spin up way more

377
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:59,689
and really expand your scope and that's

378
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,810
not gonna be the first step and I can

379
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,110
already see people ESX I got to write

380
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,230
that down

381
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,540
I got to spin up ESX whenever I get back

382
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:13,750
no that's that's not what you need to do

383
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:16,310
and then the last part is containers and

384
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,750
I don't know if you can actually see

385
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,330
that because the resolution is really

386
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,200
small but it says shut up I know it's

387
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,199
not actually a hypervisor

388
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,450
so container we talked about how

389
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,940
whenever you virtualize a computer

390
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,670
you're gonna have a separate kernel for

391
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,810
every where every machine that you spin

392
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:40,730
up right well if you run containers and

393
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,450
they have compatible kernel types you

394
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:46,220
share that kernel between all of them

395
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:49,430
that means that instead of running two

396
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,940
or three or four VMs on your laptop you

397
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:56,800
can spin up maybe 50 containers all at

398
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:00,560
the same time and not only that

399
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:03,350
containers are way easier to stand up

400
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,260
they're easier to manage I can see that

401
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:08,629
smirk and I will stop for questions here

402
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,680
in a second but they are lighter weights

403
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,660
they are easier to spin up and down and

404
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,060
they are very useful when they're

405
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:22,940
already made for you so I'm gonna pause

406
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:27,470
for questions so you raise your hand so

407
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:33,200
a container is similar to a VM except it

408
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:36,530
shares the kernel so here is a diagram

409
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,160
of traditional virtual machines versus a

410
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,750
container engine so instead of

411
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,270
virtualizing each individual operating

412
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,810
system that you want to run right so say

413
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,850
you want to

414
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,460
on a Windows laptop and you want an

415
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,770
Ubuntu VM right to actually work with

416
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,530
you know Linux commands and stuff you

417
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,450
have to virtualize that entire thing if

418
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,889
you're running a container and it's got

419
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,420
a compatible kernel all you have to do

420
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,250
is run that container engine which is

421
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,890
just a daemon it's just a program and

422
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,050
you don't have to virtualize the kernel

423
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,730
for every machine that you run which

424
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,560
means that you can spin up a whole lot

425
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,490
more they're a whole lot lighter and

426
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,230
it's super super easy

427
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:30,780
any more questions concerning containers

428
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:33,600
VMs what's up no so what they're doing

429
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:37,830
now is really weird and it's some kind

430
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,320
of hybrid BS virtualization I'm I

431
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,929
believe the actual you're talking about

432
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,590
windows subsystem on Linux right our

433
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,880
Linux subsystem for Windows yeah so I

434
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,209
believe the way that they're actually

435
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:55,320
implementing that is by using hyper-v

436
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,880
and having a move on to VM in the

437
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,560
background that you're not allowed to

438
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,660
touch and then just piping your commands

439
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:05,760
through that and then doing some kind of

440
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,620
voodoo magic to make it work but I don't

441
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,780
know if you saw that it was announced

442
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:14,000
that the next major version of Windows

443
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:16,200
is going to ship with a Linux kernel so

444
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,630
it's going to ship with Linux kernel and

445
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,980
they're open sourcing all net so Windows

446
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:26,400
is man I have hated Microsoft for such a

447
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,550
long time but it's really hard to hate

448
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,590
what they're doing here so do we have

449
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:36,590
any more questions about VMs or

450
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,590
containers or yeah what's up

451
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,630
president Kahn's why would you use want

452
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:51,120
to be there so containers abstract away

453
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:52,590
a lot of stuff they do containers for

454
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,979
example it's really hard if you're going

455
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,840
to do memory forensics what you can do

456
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,930
is you can spin up a container you can

457
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,370
spin up a virtual machine and open a web

458
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,950
browser let's say and log into your

459
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,770
email and when you log into your email

460
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,600
that that login is stored in memory

461
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,340
somewhere whether or not it's encrypted

462
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,429
how it's handled how that implementation

463
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:18,689
happens it's still in memory so if you

464
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:20,460
the virtual machine then it goes into

465
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,690
like a suspended State so you can go

466
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,130
right back to where you started from

467
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,090
right we're right back where you left

468
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:30,690
off and that's actually a memory dump so

469
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,820
one reason to use to use virtual

470
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,590
machines over docker containers is you

471
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,110
can just get memory dumps from them

472
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,970
really easy and then just take them

473
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,500
apart and with volatility or something

474
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:46,190
and do memory forensics on that let's

475
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:49,050
one pro or over the con also vm's I

476
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,230
don't know if there is a way to hook up

477
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,700
the GUI to a docker engine I think

478
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,610
someone tried to do some research on

479
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:01,200
that but docker containers usually don't

480
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:02,879
have a front end so like Kali let's say

481
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,010
everybody here knows what Kali Linux is

482
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,220
right and if you don't it's a it's a

483
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,840
penetration testing Linux framework

484
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,060
distro that gets packaged and shipped

485
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,429
out right I would definitely say run

486
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,060
Kali in a VM it's got a GUI it's there

487
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,560
for a reason

488
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,560
some things are buggy some things are

489
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,350
broken but it's some people just need a

490
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,490
cleaver stuff and that's ok I would

491
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,240
definitely say run that in a virtual

492
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:30,720
machine if you want to spin up something

493
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,810
lightweight that has network that has

494
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,240
some kind of vulnerability there you

495
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:40,110
want a container if all you're doing is

496
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,160
I want to hit this host on a network and

497
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:46,830
I want it to respond in a certain way

498
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:50,280
you want a container probably but if you

499
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:52,300
want to use the Machine you probably

500
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,149
want to be M if that makes any sense

501
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:58,270
containers are like apps kind of but

502
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,310
packaged with the operating system so

503
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,190
one reason why people really like docker

504
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,620
is oh well it'll handle all of my

505
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,120
dependencies and it will compile and

506
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,010
build the code exactly the same way

507
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,510
every time so they use it for

508
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,430
development these are for DevOps they

509
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,440
use it for rapid deployment stuff like

510
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:17,410
that but it's basically just a

511
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,690
precaution focused instead of full big

512
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,880
picture OS focused so it does a lot of

513
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:27,490
abstractions away from like the file

514
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,110
system stuff like that what docker is

515
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,550
probably the most popular container

516
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,120
engine right now it's free it's open

517
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:37,090
source I will go over a docker container

518
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,370
specifically for like looking at cyber

519
00:24:37,090 --> 00:25:05,580
stuff to show you some of the president

520
00:24:39,370 --> 00:25:08,469
comments later exactly yes that is

521
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,230
actually right there in my in my

522
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,330
presentation spinning up a website and

523
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,520
with a docker container and then coming

524
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,080
back in there yeah that's exactly the

525
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,210
use case that you would want and that's

526
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,620
why I think learning about docker and

527
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,890
learning about virtualization is really

528
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:27,939
important especially since when you

529
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:30,100
learn how to exploit stuff when you're

530
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,540
when you're just starting out and you're

531
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,919
just throwing payloads all over the

532
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,080
place and you're not really sure exactly

533
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,360
how everything works but you just want

534
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,550
to do it you're gonna make a lot of

535
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,429
mistakes you're gonna mess stuff up

536
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:45,430
right and if you spend you know three or

537
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:48,940
four hours building this full lamp stack

538
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:52,150
from scratch in a VM and you're testing

539
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,710
against that and you break something you

540
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:58,060
got you gotta figure out how to unbreak

541
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:59,560
it in a docker container if you break

542
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,470
something and you can't figure out what

543
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,790
you did to it you just destroy it and

544
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,500
press the button again and it comes

545
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,840
right back up exactly how it was

546
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,250
it's great can't tell you how many hours

547
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,560
of wasted rebuilding VMs for that range

548
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,420
any other questions concerns comments

549
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,740
want to be as interactive as possible

550
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:23,920
I'm not just gonna set up here and

551
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:25,840
preach at you alright cool so again

552
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,090
we're in containers yes it is that easy

553
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,850
you can spin up machines play with them

554
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,340
one line there is a full website called

555
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,679
docker hub where people store all of

556
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,899
their containers and this is where the

557
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,550
next example I'm going to show you is so

558
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,040
for those of you that don't know this is

559
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:49,629
dvwa it's probably one of the more

560
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:51,850
popular web testing frameworks and that

561
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,370
this website that you spin up is

562
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:56,169
basically just like web testing 101

563
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,600
right once you log in it's got a bunch

564
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:01,170
of tabs and you go over a sequel

565
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,580
injection and command injection and

566
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,230
cross-site scripting and stuff like that

567
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,990
and I don't know if you can see that

568
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:14,110
there at the top right here that is one

569
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:16,450
as one line of code that was stolen

570
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:19,330
directly from the docker hub website I

571
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,550
didn't have to write any code I didn't

572
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,310
have to do anything special all I did

573
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,720
was type in docker run well I'll

574
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:29,800
actually break the command down docker

575
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,510
run - - remove RM so that'll delete it

576
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,159
after it's done so it doesn't waste any

577
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,930
space on your machine or anything you

578
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:39,720
just spin it up and blow it away as you

579
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:42,310
want the IT flag is interactive so

580
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,440
that's gonna let you see on the backend

581
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:47,379
what all of the things you're doing

582
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,240
alright like what's going on as far as

583
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,310
you know things being able to entered

584
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,100
into the database and what processes are

585
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,899
running stuff like that port you can

586
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,550
change what port you want it's beyond

587
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,970
this we'll just spin it up on a tee for

588
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:03,250
you and then the actual path for it so

589
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,700
the actual image that it's pulling is

590
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:08,680
vulnerability is slash web - dvwa one

591
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,890
line of code you can spin it up right

592
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,970
now

593
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:15,420
and it'll pull this web set up for you

594
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:20,490
if you uh if you look at the d bwa

595
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,490
install guide for installing it on linux

596
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,710
has like I want to see a show of hands

597
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:33,280
who has actually installed this

598
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:37,650
application no dvwa it's a pain yeah

599
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,649
yeah how long did it take you

600
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:49,990
few hours yeah yeah that's about my

601
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:53,980
experience with that too yeah so once

602
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:55,900
you get into what once you've kind of

603
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,900
flushed out all right I want to I want

604
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,760
to run Kali in a VM and I want to hook

605
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,400
up my docker containers to run these

606
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,970
vulnerable web apps whether it's dvwa or

607
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,360
meta slidable or whatever application

608
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:14,710
webgoat whatever you want to to learn on

609
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,030
that particular day then you get in once

610
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,580
you feel comfortable with that you get

611
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:22,510
into the next step what do you want to

612
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:26,139
specialize in right and this is by far

613
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:28,780
the most simplified boiled down

614
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:32,020
explanation that I could possibly think

615
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,460
of for red and blue and it's much more

616
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:41,260
nuanced and there's a bunch of

617
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:43,300
differences but and in all the best red

618
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,280
teamers are the ones that used to be

619
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,730
blue teamers and the best blue teamers

620
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,920
they're the they're the X Red Team guys

621
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:54,429
so you need both you just need to pick

622
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:58,630
where you start right because if I send

623
00:29:54,429 --> 00:30:00,610
an X if I spend 2 or 3 years with all I

624
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,950
did with sequel injection of sequel

625
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,709
injection sequel injection right I know

626
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,760
every part of that attack I know exactly

627
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,679
how it works

628
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,470
I know exactly what needs to be there in

629
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,059
order for it to work now I know how to

630
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,510
stop that from happening

631
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:18,190
so that makes sense it's it's like you

632
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,020
know if you took apart your toys when

633
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,060
you were a kid just to try and figure

634
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,320
out how it works and you got really good

635
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,280
at breaking them but then you had to

636
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,470
figure out how that goes

637
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:31,570
back together this is sort of the same

638
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:34,240
concept so if you want to get into blue

639
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:38,980
teaming there's a there's a whole lot

640
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,300
more to blue teaming than there is to

641
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,980
red teaming and I know some red team

642
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,950
guys are gonna get mad at me for saying

643
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:50,590
this but the analogy that I like to use

644
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:54,610
is imagine that you have like a large

645
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:57,330
balloon full of water right and your job

646
00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:01,360
is to keep the water in that balloon

647
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:03,389
okay so you're passionate with tape

648
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,409
you're plugging holes with your fingers

649
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,270
red team's gonna come up with a shotgun

650
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,870
and they're just gonna throw whatever at

651
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:13,300
it that they can they're gonna throw

652
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,459
absolutely everything including the

653
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,629
kitchen sink at that balloon and they're

654
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,420
gonna try and get as much of that water

655
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,790
out as possible and if something doesn't

656
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,410
poke a hole that's fine they're just

657
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,950
gonna move right on to the next thing

658
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:29,250
right red team all their job is to drill

659
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,810
down all the way down to the bedrock and

660
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,480
figure out did you do a good job

661
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:38,129
securing this so at least with my

662
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,600
experience in live red vs. blue

663
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,120
scenarios is if we didn't have time to

664
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,669
harden beforehand we're gonna be putting

665
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,929
out fires for the rest of this drill

666
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,660
we're gonna be closing ports we're gonna

667
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:53,740
be looking at logs and the time it takes

668
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,720
us to actually do Incident Response to

669
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,420
take the Machine down get a system

670
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,250
tongue do forensics get a memory dump

671
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,840
look at the memory space to see what's

672
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,360
going on look if there were hooked

673
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,280
processes where did they get in build

674
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,399
the attack chain the time it takes us to

675
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:15,090
do with one incident for that red team's

676
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:18,520
already done they've finished right so

677
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:20,830
mo this is why network is so important I

678
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,830
think I think network is probably the

679
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,210
most important thing that you can learn

680
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,720
whenever you're getting into cyber

681
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:32,470
because I'm gonna go out on a limb and

682
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:37,240
say almost every single exploit that was

683
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:40,720
delivered in recent memory

684
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,430
it was through the internet right like

685
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,740
how many how many news stories do you

686
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,720
see of Facebook data breach

687
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,990
someone mission impossible through a

688
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,840
freaking ceiling vent and plugged a

689
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:55,570
flash drive into the Sandburg farm

690
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,899
doesn't happen right it just doesn't

691
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:01,389
happen almost every exploit is going to

692
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,040
be networked facing and so if you don't

693
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,320
understand how networks work and you're

694
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,050
trying to go do Incident Response you're

695
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,490
trying to go figure out okay where was

696
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,850
the attack path how did they get in how

697
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:14,440
do I fix that and you don't understand

698
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:16,659
like the basic connectivity part of it

699
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,490
you will not make any headway and that's

700
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,350
why virtual networking is so important

701
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,510
to whenever you start building networks

702
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,070
whenever you start virtualizing your

703
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,570
switch in your router and then hooking

704
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,310
that back up to a gateway and then

705
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,050
hooking up different machines to that

706
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,580
and then okay maybe I want another

707
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,480
router with a different subnet and

708
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,429
that's going to come out through that

709
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,980
same pipe okay I'm gonna trunk these

710
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:41,710
ports together that that's really

711
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:44,200
important to understand so this is

712
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:47,110
supposed to be a shout out for Raymond

713
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,180
who usually runs the CTF who encouraged

714
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:55,600
me to give this talk and did not show up

715
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:57,550
to the con this year but if you were

716
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,219
here last year years previously and you

717
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:03,340
ever done his CTF there is always a flag

718
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:06,880
somewhere that says recon is important

719
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:09,100
because it is right the absolute most

720
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,950
important thing whenever you're going

721
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,810
into any engagement is visibility

722
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:16,419
whether I'm Red Team attacking or blue

723
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,100
team defending whether I'm skint the

724
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,280
first step in every attack is to run

725
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,500
some scans always recon is the most

726
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,390
important thing that happens in any

727
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,060
cyber engagement because you need to

728
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,710
know what's there you need to know how

729
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,150
many machines are present you need to

730
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,030
know what ports are open you need to

731
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,680
know what's listening to what if you

732
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,930
don't have if you haven't done some

733
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,540
scans if the first command you don't run

734
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,159
is nmap you're gonna have a bad time

735
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,750
because you're not gonna know what's

736
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,399
going on you're not gonna know what

737
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,020
address space you're in you're not gonna

738
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,550
know what VLAN you're tagged with you're

739
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,810
not gonna know anything you're just

740
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,500
gonna get dropped in and start typing

741
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,399
commands

742
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:58,780
make any sense so there are way more

743
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,660
tools than then what's up there but in

744
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,160
most cases if you're going into a CTF or

745
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,240
something the absolute first thing you

746
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,129
want to do is you want to figure out

747
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,330
what your IP address space is and you

748
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,100
want to run some nmap scan so you want

749
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,140
to see what's in there next to you

750
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,549
once you get some machines then you want

751
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,660
to start running some vulnerability

752
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,370
assessment you don't even have some

753
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,129
vulnerability scans see what else is

754
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:20,259
what's going on next to you right it's

755
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,180
not enough to know oh there's there's

756
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,270
four or five other computers in my

757
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,310
subnet no what are they there for why or

758
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,440
why do they exist right from an

759
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,240
attacking standpoint I want to maximize

760
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,250
that attack surface I want to know

761
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,229
exactly every machine what it's hooked

762
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,380
up to whether or not it's hooked up to

763
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,180
two separate networks because computers

764
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,150
can have multiple NICs people can pivot

765
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,950
through things right so if you're red

766
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,050
teaming you want to know everything

767
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:49,270
that's going on you want to have a full

768
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,890
idea of what's networks to what what's

769
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:54,700
vulnerable what can i exploit what can I

770
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:57,040
not what should I avoid right okay so

771
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,649
now flip the flip the table now let's

772
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,779
say we're doing blue team can I get a

773
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:06,330
quick show of hands here who's actually

774
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:10,810
done real blue team before who's okay

775
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:13,920
perfect so say let's I'm gonna give you

776
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:17,140
a quick little scenario here say that

777
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,560
you just got hired you come in your job

778
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:26,740
is to secure the network right what is

779
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:30,070
the first thing you do hmm inventory

780
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:32,819
right so let's say that first thing you

781
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:36,100
come in you see a class a network and

782
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:41,910
you have I don't know a hundred thousand

783
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:44,799
machines up next step what's running

784
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:48,670
first first part in my mind is why is

785
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,460
this a class a network why are there so

786
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,920
many machines what's going on why do you

787
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,920
need this right empty space is a bad

788
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:01,330
thing whenever you have a network you

789
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:04,390
want that network to be well managed you

790
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:06,069
want to know almost immediately

791
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,690
why are everything is that's why

792
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:09,940
separate subnets exist that's why

793
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,890
separate address spaces exist you want

794
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,099
to be able to look at an IP address very

795
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:18,430
quickly and see oh that's one of our

796
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:22,509
production servers why is that talking

797
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:26,739
to the guest Wi-Fi shouldn't be ever

798
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:29,680
free tip you're here

799
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:33,160
your guest Wi-Fi should never ever ever

800
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:38,828
be allowed to talk to anything on your

801
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:41,649
network ever right and so once you get

802
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:44,410
to once you start getting a little bit

803
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:48,160
more familiar with that once you start

804
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,989
getting into the real arcane space then

805
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,339
you probably want to start getting

806
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:56,380
involved in reverse engineering and

807
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:57,849
developing a payload and I know that

808
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,140
some of you might want to start just

809
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:01,359
jump right into Ari

810
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:05,379
and though for those people like commend

811
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,140
you and that's probably what it'll say

812
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,279
on your tombstone because it is probably

813
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,489
one of the hardest things that you can

814
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:16,170
do in space reverse engineer like raise

815
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:16,170
your hand if you can read assembly code

816
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,670
great so there's like four people in

817
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:24,160
this room that can read assembly it's

818
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,549
low level it's hard it's MIDI it's

819
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,149
gritty

820
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:31,660
right if you if you really write a quick

821
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:33,880
Python script and let's say it's got

822
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,828
like a while loop do-while loop in it

823
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,309
you have any idea how many lines of

824
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:43,359
assembly code that is that's hundreds of

825
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:44,579
lines of assembly to do a loop so when

826
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,630
you get into reverse engineering

827
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,029
specifically reverse engineering malware

828
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:51,249
that's the author doesn't want you to

829
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:53,130
know what your what that's doing what

830
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:54,910
the author is doing is not documented

831
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,910
when you start reverse engineering

832
00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:02,319
malware there is a section in the intel

833
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:06,609
developer manual labeled magic I'm not

834
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:09,640
kidding I wish I was but it gets into

835
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:13,058
the real nitty gritty parts and so don't

836
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,279
get discouraged but it's probably one of

837
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,559
the hardest things that you'll ever do

838
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:18,320
that being said whenever you can finally

839
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:20,960
take a part of our

840
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,430
and see how it works and it's just one

841
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,250
of the best feelings in the world

842
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:28,160
whenever you finally crack it open

843
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:31,970
whenever you finally figure out what's

844
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,790
going on and then conversely whenever

845
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,410
you develop your first payload whenever

846
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:41,300
you write your first virus whenever you

847
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:43,069
are fully capable of understanding every

848
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,560
line of code that you just wrote and

849
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:48,500
understanding exactly what your code is

850
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:51,410
doing to that system and why it's doing

851
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,660
what it's doing and the fact that you

852
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,490
just beat whoever wrote it that's

853
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,859
probably one of the best feelings you'll

854
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,540
ever have in cyber so if you can get to

855
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:04,580
that level you've made it you should be

856
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:09,620
giving this talk but up until that till

857
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:10,700
then key takeaways right if if you sat

858
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,380
through this whole talk and learned

859
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,259
nothing but what I'm about to tell you

860
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:21,170
right now the most important thing you

861
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:23,210
need is to not give up don't drown

862
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,170
yourself in the sheer amount of context

863
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:28,750
there's so much to learn in the space

864
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:31,850
pick something you're interested in and

865
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:36,140
just go with it that's that's got to be

866
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:38,089
your first step right I recommend that

867
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,470
first step is networking because

868
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,200
everything is networked and it's

869
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,020
SuperDuper important but if the first

870
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,450
thing you want to do is sequel injection

871
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,980
and that if you're interested in it if

872
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,990
you know that you want to sit down and

873
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,720
you want to drill down you want to

874
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:59,089
hammer out how does this work do that

875
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,569
next most important thing recon

876
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:05,960
inventory what what is going on where am

877
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:07,580
i why are there so many machines why can

878
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,000
the guest Wi-Fi talk to these servers

879
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:13,069
it's not supposed to what what

880
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,950
connection was made six hours ago

881
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,440
whenever we were compromised right

882
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:21,290
logging is important too if you don't

883
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,610
have logs in your network you're not

884
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,440
gonna know what happened your stuffs

885
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,050
just gonna crash right

886
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,400
you just gave you just gave away the win

887
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,280
to the Red Team if you don't have any

888
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,270
Incident Response

889
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,560
in place so you sort of want to you want

890
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,259
to be able to follow that attack path

891
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,299
you want to be able to know what layer

892
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,230
that exploit happened that you want to

893
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,450
know when it happened

894
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:48,140
and most important you want to have fun

895
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:48,140
with any questions concerns comments I

896
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:58,850
will start randomly selecting people

897
00:41:52,050 --> 00:42:03,140
through questions how did I get started

898
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:06,029
so I was an intern in high school at

899
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,500
digital forensic solutions it's a local

900
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,380
company here in New Orleans they got me

901
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,300
interested in penetration testing and

902
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,820
Incident Response forensics then I went

903
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,800
to school at LSU for computer science I

904
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,020
started coding I took all of our

905
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,730
cybersecurity classes and by all I mean

906
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:28,440
all four of them thank you thank you it

907
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:29,880
was genuinely hard then I went back did

908
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,590
an internship again with digital

909
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,480
security associates I think is what

910
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:37,200
they're called now it's the pentesting

911
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,780
part of that DFS stuff and helped set up

912
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,950
a conference and they brought me here

913
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,410
actually

914
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,720
two three years ago they brought me to

915
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:49,649
my first NOLA con I jumped into a CTF

916
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:53,399
and I totally drowned in it there was so

917
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:56,280
much content there was so much stuff

918
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,850
that I didn't know and I totally freaked

919
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,620
out but we had a couple of interns we

920
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,860
banded together we all picked a category

921
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:06,240
and we went with it and the best the

922
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,170
best learning experience that I got out

923
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,520
of that is hey these guys are

924
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:15,870
professional pen testers they work for

925
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:20,870
actual real companies and they're behind

926
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:23,640
us maybe we can do this too right

927
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:26,850
the amount of time that you put in is

928
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:30,870
probably the most important stat if you

929
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:34,319
had a stat sheet write-up of what is

930
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:35,790
important in cybersecurity how much time

931
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,830
have you spent in networking how much

932
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:40,440
time have you spent at the terminal how

933
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:41,970
how many linux commands do you know

934
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,770
right

935
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,230
of that goes out the window it's just

936
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:48,840
how much effort have you put in how much

937
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:51,510
time have you put in anybody can get

938
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,060
started in cyber but the most common

939
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:56,730
mistake that I see in students

940
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,580
especially is they'll go back to this

941
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:04,020
great big word cloud of big scary

942
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:06,180
buzzword e corporate type terms and they

943
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,770
get overloaded and they're like oh my

944
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,259
god I could never do this there's so

945
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,540
much to learn there's so much to I have

946
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,099
no idea what's going on right when you

947
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,150
first get started you're not gonna know

948
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:19,200
everything on that list

949
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:20,369
you're just not it's okay you know you

950
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,169
don't have to know everything all at

951
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:26,190
once just pick something that you're

952
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:41,190
interested in and stick with it anybody

953
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:43,230
else for what so setting up docker you

954
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:48,390
would want to go to the docker website

955
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:51,990
they've got a install guide I believe

956
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:54,060
it's just docker calm but if it's in a I

957
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,009
think it's in most repositories now

958
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,279
pretty sure you can just app get install

959
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,470
docker and then go to docker hub and

960
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,990
there's gonna be a docker run command

961
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:05,730
and I will stay after the talk and

962
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,049
actually show people how to set it up

963
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,500
and how to use it and everything

964
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:27,570
anybody's interested in that anybody

965
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:30,960
else so the last slide is supposed to be

966
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:35,790
a github link with a whole ton of

967
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,650
resources on it but it's not so if you I

968
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:40,259
will make sure that's published with the

969
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,570
talk or something it's a github calm

970
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,330
slash Millsaps cyber slash breaking into

971
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,800
cyber hyphenated but there's a whole

972
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:50,009
bunch of resources that I've compiled

973
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:54,150
there for people to get started in a

974
00:45:50,010 --> 00:46:07,380
whole grand variety of different

975
00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:11,880
concentrations anyone else you can take

976
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:16,609
some fiddling just x11 okay so it is

977
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,609
possible I would not recommend it

978
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:25,830
alright anybody else know are we good

979
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,170
alright so that's that's the talk you've

980
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,089
got ten minutes until the next one at

981
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,700
five I guess I will hang around if

982
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:35,009
anyone has any more pressing concerns

983
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:38,720
about building cyber ranges or exploits

984
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,720
or anything in general I guess

985
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,749
