1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:11,190
okay hello that's God I warned you guys

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,559
up before they started recording so this

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,139
talk is somewhat randomly named

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,410
behavioral security and offensive

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:23,009
psychology at scale

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,198
I think we're here to give it because we

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,250
feel very strongly about the things that

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,009
we do in our career and we argue about

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,840
it a lot and we figured if we could come

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,380
to an agreement enough to put something

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,050
in the slides without killing each other

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,600
yeah well it was close you know there's

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,510
no no no one's dead are some wounds many

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,230
of which will probably never heal but uh

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,260
yeah so let's let's get into it

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:55,828
release the bio slide okay this is her

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,349
bio slide because why use words when

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,410
pictures are worth so much more Wow my

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,659
as the paranoids I run something called

23

you're here to listen to us talk and

33
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,429
you're here for information but it's

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,320
actually very useful for us to get some

35
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,820
information too so if we can do a little

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,380
show of hands exercise we have a couple

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,350
questions we'd appreciate your

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,119
cooperation how many people in the room

39
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,640
work internally at a company on an

40
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,579
internal security team not a vendor not

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,420
you know provide services a few enough

42
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:06,270
people okay okay

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,429
within your security teams how many of

44
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,450
you have a dedicated security awareness

45
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,090
function or know of a company or have a

46
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,940
customer

47
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,280
that has it cool keep your hands raised

48
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,459
if you have at least one did dedicated

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,470
full-time person for this effort what

50
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,269
surprised I'm surprised keep your hands

51
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,510
raised if this person also runs your

52
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:32,230
fishing program okay unless hands okay

53
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,679
alright let's try the same thing with

54
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:43,109
red team who's got a dedicated internal

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:45,730
red team okay and of your red team's

56
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,989
since there's so few people I don't even

57
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,359
know if it's worth asking

58
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,450
so people who's got a red team

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,940
internally okay folks that have it

60
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,738
internally are you like one of their

61
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,019
customers where whenever they do

62
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,879
something considering you're on the

63
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:08,860
security team they actually debrief you

64
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:12,640
- yes no all right and if you're if your

65
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,220
red team is internal are they are they

66
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,958
like reporting directly to the seaso or

67
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,690
are they in some other team reporting

68
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,130
directly to see saw into some other team

69
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:31,090
you guys quit just don't participate

70
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:34,540
okay okay let's move on how many don't

71
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,519
participate how many people have a red

72
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,459
team and a security engagement team that

73
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:43,169
are either on the same team or are the

74
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:49,569
same team or work super closely together

75
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:52,630
cool there's three of us yeah yeah it's

76
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:56,440
not thank you okay so we're here for

77
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,109
this very idea the idea that not only

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,299
are red team offensive security programs

79
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,690
and security engagement programs a core

80
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,359
and central part of security and should

81
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,910
be kind of everywhere baked in but that

82
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:13,630
when you combine the two together it's

83
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:17,620
actually much better and yes better

84
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,450
together and I our hope is that you will

85
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,450
take away some things if you're either

86
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,860
starting this doing this or ever finding

87
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,300
yourself needing to make the

88
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,400
justification to try and start one

89
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,050
or both of these types of things that

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,000
you'll have some extra ammunition and

91
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:36,639
some tips and something to hopefully get

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,560
you a little further but of course

93
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,440
everyone's first thought is like that's

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:50,060
a lot easier said than done like a 2020

95
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:53,960
Kanye presidency right and I think it's

96
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,139
often really tough because we're often

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,628
seen as a luxury item red team is a it's

98
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,360
an expensive luxury item thing that see

99
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:03,949
so they're CEOs or like a Rolex I like

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,270
do I get Rolex or do I get a red team

101
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:10,490
and we like like we're really we're

102
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,979
talking about a dedicated team that's

103
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,840
only focused on breaking stuff when

104
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,508
there's so many things that you probably

105
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,369
already know are already broken hiring

106
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,620
people just to go around and tell you

107
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,030
about more problems is often seen as

108
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,500
something really expensive and

109
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,780
unnecessary it's easy to say hey like

110
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,159
you know we know about enough problems

111
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,138
we don't need a team telling us about

112
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:33,680
anymore and security engagements in a

113
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,560
pretty similar state they often hear

114
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,819
things like okay well our humans are

115
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,370
trained enough we don't need anyone

116
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:42,849
doing this or the idea of bringing

117
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,520
people onto your security staff that

118
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:48,409
aren't technical bug fixers that are

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,900
going to be focusing on behaviors and

120
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:55,159
education and security culture that idea

121
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:58,190
is pretty hard for people to grasp so if

122
00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:00,740
we're ever lucky enough to actually get

123
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,469
that investment or find ourselves in

124
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,020
that position where someone said hey I

125
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:07,669
want this internal thing I want a red

126
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,789
team I want to secure the engagement

127
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,740
team we often find ourselves in the

128
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:16,190
place where nobody knows where to put us

129
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,560
so you find security engagement teams

130
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,360
and red teams specifically all over the

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,550
place it's I think it's getting a little

132
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,550
bit better if the red teams but red

133
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,860
teams are often in weird places I see

134
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,419
them in legal and there's a reason for

135
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,819
that I get it like having red team's

136
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,139
activities under privilege is good but

137
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,310
then you can't tell people about what

138
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,669
you do and you lose a lot of the

139
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,960
efficacy I see them as product security

140
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,330
teams where your red team we

141
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,888
he just focuses on abstract bugs and all

142
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,800
the times bug bounty can do things like

143
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,349
that a lot better or you get stuck doing

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,910
just security review and you're sitting

145
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:54,870
there not really even getting pen

146
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,650
testing or worse and it's driven by this

147
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,440
buzzword that I hate the idea of purple

148
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,448
team right you got red team reporting

149
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,250
sometimes directly into blue team and

150
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,840
that's a little bit of a conflict of

151
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,960
interest but they say no no it's great

152
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,429
because red team is making blue team

153
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,138
better we're doing purple team exercise

154
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,530
we're training them and that's that's

155
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,720
great

156
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,820
you know purple team it's a buzzword

157
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,889
it's really part of what a good red team

158
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,800
actually is and the idea that blue team

159
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,410
is the only customer of red team totally

160
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,599
misses the boat there is so much more

161
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,030
you can do from a red team than just

162
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:37,159
train your detection and your incident

163
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,270
response and your security controls I

164
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:42,630
think it's a little bit worse if Aaron

165
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:45,289
is here indie engagement yeah I mean

166
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,270
often nobody would know to put you and

167
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:50,820
when it comes down to it the place you

168
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,448
land is just whoever decided they needed

169
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:57,000
it or have the extra money I guess you

170
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,460
don't end up in the compliance org due

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,250
to PCI HIPAA sarbanes-oxley and other

172
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,530
corresponding requirements for security

173
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,509
awareness compliance is a very popular

174
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,070
place to land because someone a

175
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,229
compliance decided that they were going

176
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,880
to fail and Aude it without you but this

177
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:15,210
often gets you bare minimum

178
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,310
check the box security awareness or if

179
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,320
you're a little bit luckier you end up

180
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,719
with in the engineering org so on in

181
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,300
product security or AB sec decided that

182
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:26,659
it would be good to bring you in but

183
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,270
they often focus your attention on

184
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:32,729
developers secured of lifecycle being

185
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,199
part of the engineering org it's common

186
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,180
nature to want to focus on your own

187
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,339
population but then you end up ignoring

188
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,260
the bigger picture looking at the tree

189
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,409
instead of the forest but there are

190
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,720
risks in all areas of the business or

191
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:48,150
you wind up with the opposite problem

192
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,890
you educate everyone but engineers

193
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,140
because you're not technical enough to

194
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,910
talk to an engineer

195
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,680
often times being good at teaching

196
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,290
courses presenting gives you

197
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,729
above-average social skills but just

198
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,910
because I can throw an awesome event

199
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,130
doesn't mean I'm your event planner last

200
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,050
just because I can write everything from

201
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,030
course material awareness campaigns

202
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,510
company-wide email your blog post

203
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,740
doesn't mean I'm your tech writer

204
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,930
everyone wants this mythical creature

205
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,330
with all these skill sets but they don't

206
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,469
want to pay for it or consider the

207
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:25,410
incredible rarity of a unicorn enter the

208
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,870
cycle of security culture doom first

209
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,060
someone decides that they want you but

210
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,130
because they are often housed within

211
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,229
engineering or the technical side of

212
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,570
your business they don't understand what

213
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,990
these things cost videos don't grow on

214
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,000
trees

215
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,330
gave a fake excuse me gamification

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,010
sounds cool innovative in fact but the

217
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,200
platform needed to track all these

218
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,760
actions and points ain't free and the

219
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,490
prize is needed to get people to

220
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,060
participate cost even more especially if

221
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,290
your program is successful next

222
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,079
expectations for this role border on

223
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,240
unrealistic the person that you hire to

224
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,120
run the most effective program must be

225
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,070
good at presenting writing have possibly

226
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,470
the widest breadth of both security and

227
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,420
privacy knowledge sprinkle in some data

228
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,120
science for statistical significance

229
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,010
measurement improving efficacy learning

230
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,290
theory to get those knowledge bits to

231
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,240
stick behavioral science to ensure that

232
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,730
they can actually modify the behaviors

233
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,770
you're looking to change design video

234
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,260
and photo editing skills to make things

235
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,790
look nice event planning to get people

236
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,760
excited about the that you're doing

237
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,349
and on top of all this need to be able

238
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,240
to think like an attacker to

239
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,640
successfully run your fishing program

240
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,320
and other simulations at this stage of

241
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,330
the program either with an adequate

242
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,140
funding those unicorn stables ain't

243
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:46,020
cheap or you didn't actually find the

244
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,060
unicorn to begin with your program fails

245
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,939
become the Prancing success he once

246
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,500
envisioned it to be lastly because so

247
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,240
few of these programs are ever set up

248
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,860
for success our community views it as

249
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,740
flawed and run by soft soft incompetence

250
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,800
let you finish but I think the problem

251
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,820
is even bigger than this right this is

252
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,400
something that

253
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,780
happens because within the security

254
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,930
community within a lot of the

255
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:17,100
subcultures Red Team especially we don't

256
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:19,949
have consensus on what we are we don't

257
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,650
have consensus on what success actually

258
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,870
is and without that we spend all our

259
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,550
time fighting each other which is

260
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,020
hilarious because I know I spend most of

261
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,430
my time fighting people on the

262
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,260
definition of Red Team and stuff like

263
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,930
that so I'm a big part of the problem in

264
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,950
a big hypocrite but that's okay because

265
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:40,050
I sleep just fine at night we spend so

266
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:44,010
much time arguing about what it should

267
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,469
be we often miss the opportunity to grow

268
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,740
it into something new to say hey this

269
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:52,140
should be something much bigger and

270
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,120
instead we usually define what we are

271
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,220
based on that place that we landed and

272
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,960
we're sitting there pigeon-holed and

273
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,880
we're eating our pigeon hole pie and

274
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,310
we're saying well since this is my

275
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,750
current truth that must be the truth and

276
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,459
that must be what red team should be

277
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,580
everywhere that must be what security

278
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:12,510
engagement should be everywhere and this

279
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:15,960
results in us having a really hard time

280
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,730
showing value about what we do because

281
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,740
when we're trying to sales pitch the

282
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,100
value of what we do and we're going from

283
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,750
a pigeon-holed place the person we're

284
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,470
talking to they might not agree with us

285
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,990
right

286
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,970
so like Kanye here nobody understands

287
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,240
how valuable we all really are because

288
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:37,740
we don't have agreement on it this isn't

289
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:42,750
even the best add Kanye meme okay so

290
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,550
we've got this really advanced the chart

291
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,620
here if you thought that can join

292
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,750
triangles at success or something wait

293
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,600
until you see the conjoined squares of

294
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,810
fatalistic success synergy between red

295
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,550
team and security engagement now we have

296
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,900
a lot of things in common but we also

297
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,819
have a lot of things that are different

298
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,459
but some of our weaknesses are very

299
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,500
complementary so of course we both lack

300
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,650
definition by coming together we can

301
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,620
define ourselves a little bit more and

302
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:12,270
okay red team I know a lot of you are

303
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,080
really good at fishing really good at

304
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,120
spearfishing

305
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,540
really good at ascent really good at

306
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,590
getting shell on someone's computer

307
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,640
that's really nice

308
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,470
but you probably have never ran a

309
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,420
corporate-wide fishing program that

310
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,570
actually measures anything useful or

311
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,030
changes anything at scale security

312
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,100
engagement people are good at executing

313
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,500
and fishing in a scalable and repeatable

314
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,420
way but few and far between have

315
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,180
actually spear fish someone to get shell

316
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,370
and then also let's think Red Team I'm

317
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,380
sorry to say it not all of you quite a

318
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,780
few of you though you're not yeah you're

319
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,210
not people people you're computer people

320
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,189
which is good right you're technical you

321
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,200
know how to do stuff technically you're

322
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,970
smarter than everyone it's really great

323
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,010
you know how to breach physical

324
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,230
perimeters and pick blocks and decrypt

325
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,810
things that can't be decrypted but when

326
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,910
it comes to navigating the business and

327
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,099
partnering with people and helping

328
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,620
educate other people and understanding

329
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,910
that folks need a little bit more than

330
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,740
just to be told how dumb they are

331
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,740
sometimes we missed the mark

332
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,050
and because you're not technical enough

333
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,960
here in security engagement you often

334
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,000
don't get a seat at the table it sucks

335
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,160
you know we retreat our security

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,860
engagement people who we expect to be

337
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,209
able to do all of these things and know

338
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,800
all this stuff and teach everybody the

339
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,110
best stuff but we're not actually giving

340
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,030
them the stuff they need to do that and

341
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,410
okay well don't even get us started on

342
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,770
the vendor marketplace we'll try not to

343
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:44,370
ran on it too long but look it's

344
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:46,110
saturated with mediocrity it's the truth

345
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,110
and there's a lot of vendors selling a

346
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,540
lot of things the struggles that I've

347
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,940
had over the past year trying to find a

348
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,740
decent vendor that does red teaming even

349
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,620
though they all say they're amazing at

350
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,750
it no one can seem to grasp the concept

351
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,790
of what we're asking for I don't just

352
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,520
want of the whole report and then

353
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,860
there's the fishing vendors which using

354
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,540
the same header for every fish so you

355
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,050
can just filter out all the fishing

356
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,240
emails

357
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,010
yeah I'm not super realistic also have

358
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,530
you used any of those platforms lately

359
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,930
they're awful they're not innovating or

360
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,600
growing or keeping up with what

361
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,020
technology is doing and everyone else as

362
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,760
much I mean ok let's just go to the next

363
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,760
slide I'm having some bad flashbacks

364
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,140
right now a little bit ok so hopefully

365
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,430
this illustrates that security

366
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,089
engagement and red team it's a pretty

367
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,849
obvious

368
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,949
Alliance right red team can provide that

369
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,439
technical acumen they can provide that

370
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:42,809
knowledge of how the attacks really work

371
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,290
they can provide the experiences of what

372
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,389
they learned

373
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:49,860
attacking your specific company and they

374
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:52,019
can feed that to security engagement and

375
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,579
then security engagement can probably

376
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,800
help red team talk to people and

377
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:58,258
actually bake those things into

378
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,199
education material can you imagine if

379
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,550
your red team tests fuel what people are

380
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,240
actually taught at new hire orientation

381
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,769
so the good news is this has been done

382
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,110
like probably one of the greatest

383
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,360
achievements in my career is actually

384
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,240
getting this formalized on paper at a

385
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,860
company a big company and having them

386
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,970
take the risk on doing something like

387
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,949
this

388
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,079
the team's called propaganda machine

389
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,309
okay it's not actually called propaganda

390
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,050
machine I just wish it was called

391
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:26,339
propaganda machine on paper it's

392
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,170
actually called proactive engagement

393
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,300
because that sounded corporate enough to

394
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,670
make sense but I named our slack channel

395
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,800
propaganda machine so every time I look

396
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,240
in there I am happy but the important

397
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,300
part to note here is that it's a core

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,249
pillar of our security program I report

399
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,829
directly up into our sea so we've got

400
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:46,800
Red Team the fishing program we've got

401
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:50,040
security engagement all like videos and

402
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,359
swag and all the cool security culture

403
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,219
stuff that's raising people's awareness

404
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,920
in that same team they also have

405
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,420
security education in that team so we're

406
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,800
doing the technical training and it's

407
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,290
all under one umbrella and we're all

408
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,990
working together and it's it's great

409
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,029
there's lots of hashtag synergy the big

410
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,579
thing there is that we've got mission

411
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:10,770
statements and I won't you know bore you

412
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,099
with them but the core concept for those

413
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:17,520
is that we're trying to drive

414
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:20,639
behavioural change and we are trying to

415
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,029
run behavioral change campaigns and

416
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,949
within lift I am on the same team as Red

417
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:27,510
Team and a little team within

418
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:30,299
information security

419
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,529
so it can help each other up and there's

420
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,158
like two or three people in the audience

421
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:37,770
who have something similar maybe so okay

422
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:39,870
right there at this point you're like

423
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,580
well it sounds nice good for you buddy

424
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,199
but what do you what do I do

425
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,699
I got I don't got any of this stuff so

426
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
what to do if you got nothing it's

427
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,920
important to look at how a lot of red

428
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,080
team's star

429
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,750
how they get going and it's that you

430
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,000
just go hack stuff right yeah just

431
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,340
someone has to go do it so you just go

432
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,920
do hacks do some pretend crime hopefully

433
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,830
with you know it's an air cover but you

434
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,720
show that there's a problem and then at

435
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,240
that point you start to get momentum and

436
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,220
then the momentum is so often unwieldly

437
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,780
but you can use that to drive change you

438
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,180
can use that to make justification you

439
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,590
can use that to get budget and that has

440
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,480
been you I think this is where most

441
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,459
people end up where they've kind of got

442
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,800
this thing and now people are expecting

443
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,990
stuff and then the really important part

444
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:28,710
and really hard part is don't it up

445
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:30,570
too hard you could say the both red team

446
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,600
and security engagement operate on a

447
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:37,470
pretty similar platform of behavioral

448
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,969
change campaigns pretty similar process

449
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,520
and then sequence of events especially

450
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,260
if it's done well first up is setting a

451
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,150
clear goal or assumption that you are

452
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,280
challenging this keeps your eye on the

453
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,440
prize it prevents you from boiling the

454
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,129
ocean or puttin together a mishmash

455
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,340
campaign with no real success next you

456
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,800
actually need to measure some behavior

457
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:01,500
either positive or negative figure out

458
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,530
in your environment what you need to be

459
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,150
able to measure the impact and then

460
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,550
gather this data before you actually

461
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,370
start your campaigns and then last but

462
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,960
not least your strategy for actually

463
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,909
operationalizing your campaign and

464
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,250
communicating after the fact this

465
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:21,570
includes readouts emails stakeholders

466
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:23,310
training assigning remediation tasks

467
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,679
actually ensuring that you have the

468
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,570
resources available to remediate before

469
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,790
you start your campaign and then bonus

470
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:33,810
points if this is done in a scalable and

471
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:37,409
repeatable fashion also good news we

472
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:40,560
didn't just make this idea up there is

473
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,800
someone who really cares about changing

474
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,879
people's behaviors and they do so for

475
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,350
Public Health and to try and fight

476
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,810
disease it's the World Health

477
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:52,429
Organization and they've actually got a

478
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:54,810
guide and tips about how to structure

479
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,510
health based behavior will change

480
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,590
campaigns and I just want to read like

481
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,850
they've got our back here just want to

482
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,439
read to you what

483
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,178
how they define it and what they say

484
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,950
that you can be so a health campaign

485
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:08,080
follows a specific sequence that needs

486
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,539
the target audience from awareness of an

487
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,029
issue towards a behavior resulting in a

488
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,649
specific health outcome and then they go

489
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,820
on to explain a lot of really other

490
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:17,199
useful stuff as well

491
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,600
but if we think about this definition

492
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,090
and we place we replace health with

493
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,039
security we can think of a security

494
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,080
behavioral change campaign something

495
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,820
that follows a specific sequence that

496
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,399
tries to move our target audience

497
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,830
normally our company from awareness of

498
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:34,809
an issue like knowing that they should

499
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,100
have a strong password or knowing that

500
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:38,500
they should lock their computer knowing

501
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,668
that they shouldn't get fished towards a

502
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,580
behavior resulting in a specific

503
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:44,049
security outcome that is what we are

504
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,070
trying to do here we were trying to

505
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:50,590
change behaviors to improve security

506
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,360
additionally they have some other advice

507
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,949
down at the bottom of this page I just

508
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,299
want to key on on a few things I'm not

509
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,149
going to read what they're saying about

510
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,830
health issues but if we think about the

511
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:02,350
three bullets that they have right

512
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,059
involve partners early in their campaign

513
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,590
think about it if you're gonna go hack

514
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,379
something and you want people to support

515
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,289
it you should go talk to the people who

516
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:14,500
are responsible early on like before you

517
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:16,330
do it to get buy-in right use trusted

518
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,429
messengers I think this is a really

519
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,379
devious thing when we spin it to our

520
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:23,289
thing but if you think about it people

521
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:25,480
would respond much better if the leaders

522
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,610
in their organizations or people they

523
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,590
trust or influencers within your

524
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,389
organization are the ones that are

525
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,730
telling them that they need to do

526
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:35,860
security stuff rather than the security

527
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,620
people telling them so they make pretty

528
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,240
good trusted messengers and then the

529
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,820
last one ensure availability of

530
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,669
community resources I think about this

531
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,918
this is probably our like biggest

532
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:50,470
blunder as security people we think

533
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,490
about all the security problems and then

534
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,980
we go like look at all the problems we

535
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,259
found go fix them all but we don't think

536
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,870
about if the resources are actually

537
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:01,389
available for those people to do that

538
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,739
like is there a solution at all do the

539
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:04,059
people that you're telling to do

540
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,019
something differently actually have

541
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:10,600
access to the right products is it even

542
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,100
possible so I think thinking keep some

543
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,789
of these things in mind when we think

544
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,719
about changing behavior is going to be

545
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:21,350
really useful for us now executive

546
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,590
buy-in this is something that we all say

547
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,209
a lot it's a pretty great buzzword it's

548
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,090
something that you could probably like

549
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,429
unpack an entire talk into which if you

550
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,379
caught April's talk yesterday a lot of

551
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,269
it's about that a whole talk about how

552
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:38,570
do you get people to do what you'll want

553
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:40,759
now we have this this problem right

554
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,979
where we say executive buy-in but we

555
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,869
don't really know what it means I think

556
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:47,389
a lot of people might assume that

557
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:51,559
executive buy-in means that someone who

558
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:53,899
is an executive or your boss said ok to

559
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,320
something and that's not executive Buy

560
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:58,549
and that's approval from somebody

561
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,379
executive buy-in I think we could

562
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:03,440
explain it or to find it a little bit

563
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:05,059
better as most of the people who have

564
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,879
any political power within your

565
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:10,190
organization or any vested interest in D

566
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:12,289
railing your program or your objective

567
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,119
or whatever you're trying to do they all

568
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:15,739
think that your program is a good idea

569
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,139
and they support it

570
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:23,359
having or at least most of them right

571
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:26,539
having that that is executive buy-in so

572
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,099
I think and this is Sam's idea but I'll

573
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:30,679
talk to it I'll take credit for it I

574
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:33,799
guess but executive buy-in is basically

575
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,269
a social engineering campaign if you

576
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:36,979
think about it right this should come

577
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:39,190
really naturally to us if we think about

578
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:41,330
how we get things done inside our

579
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,309
organizations its enumeration right

580
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,039
figure out who the people who might

581
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,149
derail your project are find them figure

582
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,289
out what they care about

583
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:53,809
regular OSINT works for this you know

584
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:56,269
exploitation use social engineering

585
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:59,090
approach those folks with a pretext that

586
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,909
makes sense to them and try and get them

587
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,949
on your side and then escalation right a

588
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:05,659
lot of times in a red team operation as

589
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,190
you're pivoting through things you use a

590
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:08,509
little bit of access somewhere to get

591
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,279
more and you start with the easiest

592
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:15,369
stuff the low-hanging fruit first you

593
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,369
can do this and getting buy-in as well

594
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,119
so here's a list of some people that we

595
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,678
came up with that you need to make

596
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:24,678
friends with people that you might need

597
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,659
buy-in from really good partners that

598
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,670
are nice to have if you're a red team or

599
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:29,800
security engagement

600
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,560
both or just if you're security in

601
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,899
general these resources are available to

602
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,060
you so of course your target but think

603
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,980
about internal comms there's someone who

604
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,720
sends emails out to everybody in the

605
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,940
organization you want to communicate

606
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,980
from security you need them to be your

607
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,320
friend they are the gatekeepers of it

608
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,050
they are the facilitators of it the

609
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,700
learning team the learning team's

610
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,770
responsible for teaching people stuff

611
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,960
they're probably better at it than you

612
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,070
they probably have a platform to do it

613
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,070
already you don't need to go make your

614
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,050
own onboarding new hire onboarding

615
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,669
getting people there and getting

616
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,139
security messaging right at the start

617
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,430
important need friends to be friends

618
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,620
with them and of course you need

619
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,760
designers and event planners and that

620
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,070
way we don't have to put it all on one

621
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,590
person in the Security org people do

622
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,610
this stuff at your company already and

623
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,169
of course you should probably bribe

624
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,060
procurement because getting vendors on

625
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,290
board is terrible and the market is so

626
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,760
saturated that you're probably gonna

627
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,909
have to do it a lot to find a good one

628
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:30,100
and then finance cuz everyone needs that

629
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:33,040
money right okay so if you're a

630
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,110
resource-constrained like I don't got

631
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,290
the budget don't cut by and I have no

632
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,870
resources think about these partnerships

633
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,629
and think about how you can do something

634
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,189
that is very common tactic in the red

635
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,860
team world right we call it living off

636
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:50,080
the land it's the idea that it's a lot

637
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,830
more effective a lot stealthier and a

638
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,360
lot louder outside if we if we live off

639
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,639
the land if we use the tools that are

640
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,469
already baked into the system to

641
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,000
accomplish our goals rather than trying

642
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,040
to stage new binaries and stage new

643
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,900
tools on there the same thing works in

644
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,360
environments if we want to create mass

645
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,040
security behavioral change at scale we

646
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,510
should use the tools that are already

647
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:15,879
existing in our environment and the coup

648
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:21,160
de Gras the big goal here the ultimate

649
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,610
goal is that we once our propaganda our

650
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,530
security content to be integrated

651
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:29,560
everywhere but ideally right it's that

652
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:31,570
main app that everyone uses to socialize

653
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,850
it's that central place that all

654
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,439
employees see that all employees go if

655
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,060
you're gonna build security engagement

656
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,120
securing awareness you don't want some

657
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,530
side portal off in the distance like

658
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,719
security engagement dot Internet

659
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,910
you want it baked into the central thing

660
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,730
so if you can take over whatever you use

661
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:51,370
like if your Facebook right Facebook

662
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,320
uses Facebook for work right lots of

663
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,479
people use that that's where you want

664
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,700
security content to be right if you have

665
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,020
a platform internally you should use it

666
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,610
so also big big bonus points if you can

667
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,260
actually measure engagement there's

668
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,929
nothing like creating a security video

669
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,340
or a security poster and not even

670
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,050
knowing how many people watched it

671
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,429
that's terrible right we should be

672
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,840
better than that we should know how many

673
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:18,280
people actually care about watching a

674
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,500
video if we make it for security okay so

675
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,010
that's a great theoretical philosophical

676
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,730
rant Sam and I started talking about

677
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,140
this stuff quite some time ago and I was

678
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:34,750
like I all these amazing ideas and she's

679
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:37,690
like yeah I did this so I'll let her

680
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:42,700
tell you about that I think I said don't

681
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:45,700
you even know who I am at a previous

682
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:48,130
employer I actually accepted the job

683
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,190
there because I had a dream of building

684
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:54,150
out my security engagement material and

685
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:58,150
running it through a very specific

686
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:00,700
company communication channel problem as

687
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,560
soon as I joined and shared this idea I

688
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,460
learned that not only had it never been

689
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,100
done before

690
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:09,970
but it was in fact explicitly denied by

691
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,409
the biggest boss in the company I never

692
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,630
backing down from a challenge

693
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:18,250
considered it to be my greatest social

694
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:21,360
engineering challenge I began the early

695
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:23,830
stages of enumeration as Josh described

696
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,570
social engineering but eventually

697
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,490
determined I was going to need a really

698
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,250
good pretext to get the meeting with the

699
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:33,190
big boss enter collaboration with red

700
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,050
team I wanted to ensure that anything I

701
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,150
did was driving the biggest impact

702
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:39,490
possible but I needed what I brought to

703
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,650
this meeting to be a home run I started

704
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,920
by creating a fishing risk model to

705
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,870
stack rank the potential campaigns that

706
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,190
we could do within our environment and

707
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,830
make sure that I was selecting the

708
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,660
biggest target now I've dedicated a

709
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,480
whole talk on this before so I'm gonna

710
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,580
do my best to

711
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,450
like summarize it and like a minute here

712
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,280
the idea is this when you are creating

713
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,290
your your big list of potential

714
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,129
campaigns you start with a fishing

715
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:11,129
action there on the side and then figure

716
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:14,340
out which tool you're going to use to

717
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:17,220
get at your specific asset and whether

718
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,080
or not that tool has a multi factor or

719
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,210
two factor authentication gate on it and

720
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,250
then making sure that you're selecting

721
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,290
the right target to get at that asset

722
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,710
and if you've done good baselining

723
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,770
you already have a list of

724
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,000
susceptibility rankings by employee and

725
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,470
maybe some additional information or

726
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
whether or not employees within that

727
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,250
group are likely to have admin

728
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,220
privileges on the tool that you're going

729
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,230
after so choosing a random example

730
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,240
literally this morning out of thin air

731
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,190
let's say I wanted the details of a

732
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,049
pending acquisition for my company I

733
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:55,080
might by running this model determined

734
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:57,900
that I would like my target the legal

735
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,510
team to grant chrome plug-in permissions

736
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,370
to desktop capture I think that's a

737
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,140
pretty high likelihood of getting the

738
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,299
information that I'm seeking by running

739
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,370
this model I might also determine that I

740
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:11,429
don't want to fish them to capture

741
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,979
credentials because Gmail is protected

742
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:20,400
by two FA and I'm likely not going to be

743
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:22,640
successful at the time I determined that

744
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:27,960
we should run an OAuth phishing campaign

745
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,730
before it was cool I might add at the

746
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,120
time this wasn't something that could be

747
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:36,240
done with the vendor and it was a really

748
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,580
like good moment for bringing these two

749
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,000
teams together because what happened

750
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,760
after our targets allowed these

751
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
permissions couldn't have been done by

752
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,520
my team alone conversely if the red team

753
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,950
were trying to do this on their own they

754
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,230
wouldn't have been able to craft the the

755
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:58,470
beautiful lure and pretext that my team

756
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:01,440
could it was beautiful synergy fun fact

757
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,179
later when that really noisy oo-aah

758
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,380
phishing campaign heard round the world

759
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,049
went around

760
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:10,200
an employee on our in our company

761
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:12,690
reported it in less than 60 seconds so

762
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,910
it was also social in an era so I can't

763
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:21,600
talk security engagement win there we go

764
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:23,340
okay now that I had that juicy readout

765
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,110
from the successful campaign to report

766
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,629
on I went back to my corporate social

767
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,850
engineering campaign I had started with

768
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,280
the easiest person within my company to

769
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:35,340
get a meeting with actually six months

770
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,740
prior to the ultimate meeting that I had

771
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,510
with the big boss of my company every

772
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,770
meeting that I had from that point on I

773
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,320
went about gathering background

774
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,840
information on this tool the big boss's

775
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,570
resistance using it for the means that I

776
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,340
wanted to and then gathering more intel

777
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,520
on the next person that i was going to

778
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,860
meet with to continue to gather support

779
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,059
and approval for making my dream a

780
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:02,129
reality I learned that one executive

781
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,830
that was really hard to get meetings

782
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,630
with often had early morning available

783
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,020
slots on their calendar and they had a

784
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,789
penchant for a certain breakfast food

785
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:16,440
enter the best social engineering tool

786
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:19,140
of all time the Egg McMuffin friends

787
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,350
along the way I met with included design

788
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,320
the procurement team internal comms they

789
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:28,080
had also been denied access to this tool

790
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,059
for a long time so my success who is

791
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,559
going to become their success so they

792
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:34,080
were really supportive of this endeavor

793
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,340
and then product and engineering who

794
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,158
ultimately were going to need to make

795
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,620
the changes that I needed to drive this

796
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,900
project forward I jumped from one person

797
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,580
to the next gathering more support until

798
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,770
I felt like I had met with every single

799
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,320
person within the company and then my

800
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:51,870
big day arrived I started with my red

801
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,049
team readout and was very quickly

802
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:57,570
granted approval to use this tool for

803
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,129
whatever means I saw necessary as the

804
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,918
ultimate solution for fixing our

805
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,380
behavior problems then I was able to

806
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,650
conclude my operation and begin the fun

807
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,409
part celebrating on the roof with a

808
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,600
bottle of champagne of course with my

809
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:14,790
new permissions and resourcing I got to

810
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,980
do a lot of really cool and experimental

811
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:20,110
security engagement active

812
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,890
but the ultimate victory of my operation

813
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:25,719
didn't happen until a year later I

814
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,730
mentioned that our employees caught that

815
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,370
real Roth attack which which was a nice

816
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,800
quick win but a year later when I

817
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:35,050
gathered all of our data I found that

818
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,889
through classifying and calculating all

819
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:40,480
real reported phishing emails 70% of

820
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,580
them were legitimate phishing attacks

821
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,100
against the company that means that our

822
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:48,419
employees were really good at spotting

823
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:52,540
real phishing attacks and reporting them

824
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:56,020
we also did a campaign with a malicious

825
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,639
binary executable every single person

826
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,129
who actually ran it on their device

827
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,700
reported it to our team which meant that

828
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:05,230
we had a really strong security culture

829
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:09,030
and that they were able to recognize

830
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,030
that they had done something wrong so

831
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,610
high-level summary all that right it's a

832
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,950
kind of like a three-step process when

833
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:21,609
you're trying to change behavior first

834
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:24,428
its plan use that risk model brainstorm

835
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:27,069
attack vectors try and figure out which

836
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:29,139
ones are actually likely which ones are

837
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:31,300
actually going to have an impact which

838
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:34,030
ones actually apply to your company and

839
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,100
then determine the required sample size

840
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,169
because some things get polluted when

841
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,460
you do too much right like especially in

842
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,980
the world of fishing the more fish you

843
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,510
send out the less effective it is but

844
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,500
you do need to take a sample size if

845
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,060
you're going to measure something you're

846
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,480
gonna actually baseline so that you can

847
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,199
see if you change something or not and

848
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,540
then it's execute go hack all things

849
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:59,500
right file all the tickets tell all the

850
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,700
people decide on the changes this part's

851
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,170
really important because you have to do

852
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,259
it in partnership with all those people

853
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,240
you talk to at the beginning and then go

854
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,800
get buy-in from all the players using

855
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,240
your advanced social engineering

856
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,710
internal campaign right and then modify

857
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,500
she wrote communicate with elephants

858
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,690
which i think is fabulous but you have

859
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,340
you have to be able to go engage with

860
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,440
everybody you have to consider how are

861
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,940
the executives going to react you have

862
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,560
to consider how are the people who have

863
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,210
to do the work going to react how are

864
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,029
the targets going to react manager

865
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:33,099
expectations but then the big thing is

866
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,920
the train the people change the

867
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:37,480
processes make the adjustments modify

868
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,730
things mitigate the risks do you

869
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,730
identified and then repeat the process

870
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,140
ok so I left this slide in here mostly

871
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,910
so we could get this con game even there

872
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:52,118
but I think there's something that is

873
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:54,970
worth mentioning here and then we do

874
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,070
have some time so you guys probably know

875
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:02,319
what the dunning-kruger effect is but

876
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:04,589
it's a old 1999 psychological principle

877
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,800
based on some research that shows that

878
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:11,770
simply people overestimate their own

879
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,380
ability by quite a bit and the less

880
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:16,599
ability they have the more likely they

881
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,390
are to overestimate and also

882
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,390
overestimate it by more so you get this

883
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:24,400
kind of curve like this where you don't

884
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:27,040
know nothing and you're pretty sure you

885
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,930
can't do it but then you just start to

886
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,109
learn about it and ya think you're the

887
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,910
best better than anybody but then as you

888
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:35,020
gain experience over time and you

889
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,790
actually learn everything that's

890
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,960
involved your confidence goes down

891
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,040
you're like damn I don't know anything

892
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,599
and we experienced this a lot in

893
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,940
security and has a lot of parallels but

894
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,849
one of the things is that we find

895
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:48,700
ourselves in this really initial first

896
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:51,339
part a lot as security folks we're all

897
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,779
very smart we think outside the box we

898
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:55,660
can solve any problem

899
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,750
so whenever we pick up a new problem we

900
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:02,649
think it's easy we think design is easy

901
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:05,980
UX is easy coms is easy marketing is

902
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:08,470
easy data analytics is easy so that's

903
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,270
not super easy right some people are

904
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,189
devoting everything to it and their

905
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,950
industries are actually a bit more

906
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:18,280
advanced than ours like if you think

907
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:22,118
about measuring engagement from things

908
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:26,440
there's better tools than the fishing

909
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:28,839
platforms we have in our industry Masha

910
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,210
here shout-out to her sorry like I got a

911
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:32,920
background in marketing revenue

912
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,170
analytics she's like there's this whole

913
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,490
card Marketo it's ten times better than

914
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,410
your fishing platform because it can

915
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,808
measure all these things that this thing

916
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:43,939
can't and this highlights

917
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:46,039
really a change that we need to make in

918
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:51,038
the security industry where we start

919
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:53,719
recognizing the power of non-traditional

920
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,789
security background type people because

921
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:57,680
I think it's a lot easier to teach

922
00:37:55,789 --> 00:38:00,199
people about security at least a

923
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,390
baseline level that they need than it is

924
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:05,089
to teach them this entire field after we

925
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:07,339
joined them with basic security ology so

926
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:09,288
let's make security a little bit diverse

927
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:10,910
not just from a gender or a color

928
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,619
standpoint but from a skillset

929
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,170
standpoint so that we can benefit from

930
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:17,900
the learnings that other people have so

931
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,059
I'll see just some powerful lessons and

932
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,400
how your team is perceived by other

933
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:23,930
people within your company well not

934
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:30,949
everyone in your team comes from

935
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:33,739
security yeah that's the end this would

936
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:35,719
be the QA point and if we didn't trigger

937
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:44,689
any questions for you I hope this slide

938
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:47,049
triggers a couple cool you must have

939
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,049
explained everything

940
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:21,558
I mean treating people like cancer is

941
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,900
one approach right ooh damn you're

942
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:27,229
causing pain suffering into the company

943
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:33,199
let's just cut you out I think that's

944
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:37,339
probably more of a symptom there's more

945
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:40,189
that can be done to remove choice from

946
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:45,499
the equation I think before you result

947
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:49,239
in our resort determinations like giving

948
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:51,698
them Chromebooks or removing access to

949
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,079
limit the damage they can cause

950
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:55,640
yeah to see the other side of the

951
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,430
argument though slightly I mean if you

952
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,390
you you think about it you only probably

953
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:04,250
have to do that once you know that's

954
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,020
that's a pretty it's a pretty intense

955
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,360
campaign so maybe you could like fake

956
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,070
fire someone for fishing and spread that

957
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,690
information around that someone was

958
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,860
fired for falling for a fishing thing so

959
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:17,080
they're afraid but I don't know if I

960
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,080
would do that it desires some thought

961
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,110
yeah okay so he's saying that it's

962
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,480
actually a three-strike process that was

963
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:50,390
involved and it's a also you mentioned

964
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,400
something that I think we didn't quite

965
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:55,549
dive into deep enough and it's that like

966
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,350
you clicked on something if we talk

967
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:00,170
about that you know the saturated vendor

968
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,910
marketplace the majority of fishing

969
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,500
vendors this is this is actually one of

970
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,089
the things that we argued about and how

971
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:10,130
stupid it was what it ultimately agreed

972
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:12,860
but it's we're measuring click rate who

973
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:15,140
cares that's not the state of like

974
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,220
modern browsers and computers maybe like

975
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,859
in the middle of nowhere where

976
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,870
everyone's still running ie6 but like

977
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,820
clicking on something is just one action

978
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,650
it's what happens after that what you do

979
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,470
after that click the link like I don't

980
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:29,930
care like let's realize for a moment

981
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,750
that the majority of everything you do

982
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:34,190
on the Internet is clicking on links why

983
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,140
are we measuring that why are we trying

984
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,850
to change click rate let's try and

985
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,920
change like if people do the actual

986
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,569
behavior that's bad do you enter your

987
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,310
creds into a portal do you download a

988
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:46,040
malicious thing do you reply to an email

989
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:49,130
and give information out you grant

990
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,410
permissions your permissions you to an

991
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,750
OAuth app that's random do you install a

992
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:58,060
malicious chrome plug-in let's measure

993
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,060
things that actually matter yeah

994
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:14,610
is this are you do you work for a

995
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:16,710
fishing okay so he's saying all the

996
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:20,070
fishing vendors are crap and it's not a

997
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,700
it's not a pitch to sell a product that

998
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:26,250
we have

999
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:29,279
but thanks for maybe buying it do you

1000
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,930
want me to answer that I I wouldn't say

1001
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,250
that all of them are crap

1002
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:38,160
I have never purchased one in a

1003
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,360
corporate environment usually choosing

1004
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,890
to just do it myself

1005
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:46,530
I find that has many advantages a it

1006
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,720
allows me the full ability to customize

1007
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,760
my attacks towards what I'm like

1008
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,410
actually seen as real attacks in my

1009
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,930
environment I get to do more fun things

1010
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,730
like oh wasps fishing that wouldn't have

1011
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,540
been possible by purchasing the vendor

1012
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:05,190
and it there's there's more you've

1013
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,830
you've heard my spiel a million times

1014
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,630
where am I yeah I mean it's it's often a

1015
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,850
little bit easier cuz even when you do

1016
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:15,600
deploy one of us I know what it was

1017
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:17,580
please okay many times these vendors

1018
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,950
have a handshake with a major email

1019
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:22,080
providers you get their emails through

1020
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,450
to your inbox which means that you're

1021
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,390
testing your employees on that they

1022
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:29,520
wouldn't naturally receive but if I set

1023
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,500
up the campaigns myself I usually spend

1024
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,700
a month like BAE my head on a desk

1025
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,120
trying to figure out how to get around

1026
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,370
kushina's band filters but the reward is

1027
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,049
much greater because I know when I go to

1028
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,060
sleep at night that anyone who receives

1029
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,070
that email could have received it from

1030
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,560
an outside attacker and I didn't cheat

1031
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:48,240
the system to test them yeah there's a

1032
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,759
big chop the big problem in training

1033
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,379
people to the simulation rather than

1034
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,680
training them against what reality looks

1035
00:43:52,380 --> 00:44:02,360
like I also I have bought some fishing

1036
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,359
platforms and I have a lot of regret

1037
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:35,850
in dollars I I personally don't involve

1038
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,620
myself in trying to quantify stuff with

1039
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:41,100
dollar amounts while it's probably a

1040
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:43,799
good approach I found it useful to just

1041
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:47,540
show that you're giving the business

1042
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,370
information that is actually actionable

1043
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,980
right taking like if you're gonna show

1044
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,779
value often the value of an offensive

1045
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,700
security program this is like learned in

1046
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,770
the trenches of Red Team the value of

1047
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,080
that team isn't finding bugs I mean

1048
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:04,200
that's nice but the value is that you're

1049
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,420
giving someone a view into what's bad

1050
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,520
and what's good because as organizations

1051
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,310
grow they get so big that you just you

1052
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,320
can't possibly know everything and it's

1053
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:15,390
really hard to make decisions so a big

1054
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,190
value we can provide is let's give you

1055
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,740
data on how people actually behave and

1056
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,990
what groups or what classifications

1057
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,640
within our company aren't performing up

1058
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:26,490
to standards like who's the worst at

1059
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,900
fishing stuff like that so I'm trying to

1060
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,589
show value and like look we're gonna

1061
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,630
give you data that's useful rather than

1062
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:36,630
like we saved you money because I think

1063
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:39,240
that that's more that's even that level

1064
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,730
of hand-waving is even hard for me one

1065
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,339
of my most oval metrics is looking at

1066
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,720
real potential incidents that the

1067
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,360
company may have had that were thwarted

1068
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,490
by employees reporting it there was

1069
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,790
otherwise not detected by any technology

1070
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:58,129
that was put in place yeah look how much

1071
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:58,130
you spent on this thing that didn't work

1072
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:05,290
cool I think we're a time so thank you

1073
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:11,010
and that's the end bye

1074
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:11,009
[Applause]
