hi I'm Jo gray I'm a senior security

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,109
architect

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,779
20:17 derbycon social engineering

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,250
capture the flag winner last year the

5
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,759
password inspection agency got third

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,489
place in the ascent CTF when I came down

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,230
we're in third place again this year so

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,050
if anyone has any specific information

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,360
relating to jim knitter our security

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,649
panda or daemon small please send a DM

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,680
on twitter to d fi our noob chris did

12
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,780
say we could crowdsource the flags so I

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,309
can't compete right now so if you want

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,860
to help out go for it

15
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,718
but beyond that I'm writing a book with

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,210
no starch press right now as well so

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:05,309
that's pretty much me alright my name is

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,180
Sofia family for those who don't know me

19
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,460
I am the founder of besides Nova back

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:17,250
established back in 2016 we just done

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,369
after the con in March I'm a mobile team

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,930
or an insurance company I speak three

23
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,729
languages so if anybody needs

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,500
translation to French or I can help I

25
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,650
try to mentor whenever I have time and

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,880
I'm also Nova hack remember back in

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,250
Virginia a lot of disclaimer and I'm not

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,869
the views or thoughts in this

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:46,140
presentation reflect those of the

30
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:48,570
organization's we work for represent so

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,220
to kind of define the objectives we're

32
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,770
going to look at things both offensively

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,259
and defensively so kind of in a purple

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,548
team sense so on the offensive

35
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,200
perspective we're going to look at

36
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,600
considerations of spoofing versus

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,549
squatting a little bit about payloads

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,750
and links nuts anything too heavy there

39
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:12,150
as well as timing and the infrastructure

40
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,680
and evasion when necessary defensively

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,099
we'll look at of course the

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,480
detection and key operator here

43
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:24,149
attempted attribution yes that's some

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,890
service the keyword so the basics of

45
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,909
social engineering

46
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,189
what is human hacking it's basically the

47
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:39,078
ability for social engineer to

48
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:43,769
manipulate a victim's frame of reference

49
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:45,720
as the odds of persuasion you the social

50
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,000
engineer have the ability to motivate

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,819
the victim to do what they want they

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,150
need them to do we see these with we see

53
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,730
this kind of attempt every day on ads

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,500
right marketing organizations try to

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,200
manipulate our thoughts to get us to

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:06,870
purchase to fill the need that we have

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,328
to if we want to look cool or all sorts

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,769
of things with building reports car

59
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:14,010
salesmen are probably the most infamous

60
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,930
social engineers they probably are some

61
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,698
of the most poorly trained but they're

62
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,979
there as well so sales and marketing

63
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,180
basically social engineering and open

64
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,000
source intelligence just with a

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,620
different outcome yeah

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,299
so looking at the types of social

67
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,069
engineering

68
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,049
it typically social engineering does

69
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,298
usually result in a dumpster fire your

70
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,979
mileage may vary but with this

71
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,290
presentation we're going to focus on

72
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,629
fishing but know that you have fishing

73
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,489
and smishing as well there's the whole

74
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,518
physical security aspect of sneaking in

75
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,280
places lock-picking subverting those

76
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,720
types of systems dumpster diving and

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,370
baiting as well so digging into social

78
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,400
engineering just to kind of set the tone

79
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,629
for this I get this question a lot of I

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
want to get into social engineering what

81
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,108
do I need to study these are the five

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,150
things I say you should study but in

83
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,180
this presentation we're really going to

84
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,129
focus on the acting InfoSec and

85
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,019
psychology portions if you bring in

86
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,149
phishing then you've got some improv

87
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,519
associated with it as well and then of

88
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,649
course doing this in an ethical sense

89
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,060
more than likely for hire there's gonna

90
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,728
be some technical writing but that's

91
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,620
kind of unwritten because everything

92
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:27,510
requires some sort of technical writing

93
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:31,200
so let's get into the actual idea of

94
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,900
the sending the email piece so which

95
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,409
targets are you going to go for in a

96
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,229
consulting role will the customer slash

97
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,210
victim slash target give you the email

98
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,100
addresses that you're going to target or

99
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,840
are you left to your own devices via

100
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,050
open source intelligence Oh sent to do

101
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,090
this in terms of protections can you

102
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,400
enumerate any protective mechanisms they

103
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,590
may have like point mime cast that kind

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,620
of fun stuff are they using something

105
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:03,239
like SPF or d mark to filter the mail

106
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,130
what kind of timeline are you looking at

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,430
for doing this like in a consulting role

108
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,770
do you have two hours to send a fish to

109
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,830
30,000 people or do you have like 12

110
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,310
hours to fish I mean 100 people that's

111
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,789
going to dictate how complex you can get

112
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,140
with that

113
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,090
what kind of payload are you going to do

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,800
I classify from the vein of fishing

115
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,390
collection of passwords to be a payload

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,070
of sorts because at the end of the day

117
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,979
that's what you're trying to do but it

118
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,409
could also be an actual file of some

119
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,880
sort of malware such as like a macro

120
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,420
enabled Word document you can build

121
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,710
something and say venom or Empire or

122
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,570
something like that

123
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,000
or it could just be click the link and

124
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,099
then the link can handle there the dirty

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,380
business for you do you want to go

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,100
manual do you want to go automated there

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,390
are benefits to each I personally don't

128
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,310
care if we're going the automated

129
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,469
approach I prefer to craft everything by

130
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,790
hand and get it out the door because I

131
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,500
could actually take a little bit more

132
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,950
time and not have anything that's going

133
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,620
to set off any alarms for hey this was

134
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,260
done with like a fishing kit or this was

135
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,340
done with like Kingfisher or social

136
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,800
engineer toolkit or some of those

137
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,539
solutions I mean they're good it's just

138
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,550
typically whatever I'm doing these types

139
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:22,500
of engagements I have far better success

140
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:24,690
with manual testing so there's always

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,290
other considerations it could vary based

142
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,350
on the organization or just the country

143
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,360
you're in for example if you're

144
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,010
targeting someone in the European Union

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,360
there's those for pesky letters that all

146
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,750
the salespeople are trying to cram down

147
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,400
our throats in gdpr so keep that kind of

148
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,850
stuff in mind so

149
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,409
looking at the offensive angle let's

150
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:51,630
take a look at the Oh scent of this and

151
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:55,229
things like the MX record it's necessary

152
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,139
within DNS for emails to actually be

153
00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:00,508
able to be sent and received SPF the

154
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,400
sender policy framework that is meant as

155
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,070
a mechanism that's supposed to help you

156
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,840
filter the emails so that you're only

157
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,360
getting a legitimate stuff and then who

158
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,020
is that's always out there to find out

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,110
who owns what but the beautiful thing is

160
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,150
just like tools like say in map or even

161
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,490
a hammer is it a weapon or is it a tool

162
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,250
and it all depends on intent there are

163
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,830
methods which I have a short demo at the

164
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,880
very end that we can actually go through

165
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,130
and exploit various things within who is

166
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,900
and other records to be able to get

167
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,180
information that's going to help us with

168
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,580
the phishing campaign specifically out

169
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,360
of recon ng but you should also probably

170
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,479
check the career of pages see if they're

171
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,360
hiring someone for an email security

172
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,130
appliance companies infamously tell too

173
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,880
much information about themselves on

174
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,949
social media on social media for one but

175
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,800
also on the careers page because I mean

176
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,889
most people don't just blindly apply to

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,289
a position if you like for example if

178
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:08,130
you're a database administrator you may

179
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,930
be good in MySQL and NS sequel but you

180
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,030
may only be good in one or the other so

181
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,159
to try to streamline the application

182
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,659
process companies typically say I'm

183
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:19,080
looking for one or the other

184
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:21,000
and then in from the ocean perspective

185
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,840
we're able to read and say hey well

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,010
there they say they have MS sequel so

187
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,109
chances are they're a Microsoft shop -

188
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,560
so it's time to break out those windows

189
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,419
exploits but then also there's a website

190
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,490
hunter audio we'll look at that later as

191
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,120
well and a tool that's now built into

192
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,940
Kali called in spy it's not installed by

193
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,770
default it's just apt-get install in spy

194
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,089
and it's right there the only thing you

195
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,880
need is an API key 200 is free and you

196
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,029
do that and it will query hunter dot IO

197
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,610
for the email syntax and then it will

198
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,010
query

199
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,329
LinkedIn for employees of said company

200
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:04,569
and build you a target list so pretty

201
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:08,050
awesome for that and then of course SPF

202
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,850
d km or d mark so to kind of set the

203
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:15,160
stage on that basically all three of

204
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:18,160
them are different frameworks of sorts

205
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,019
that are supposed to filter mail that's

206
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,029
supposed to ensure that it is coming

207
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,250
from who it's supposed to come from it's

208
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:26,170
not being spoofed and this person is

209
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,070
authorized to send emails into this

210
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,040
organization SPF has already had holes

211
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,860
shot in it like Swiss cheese so it's

212
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,490
really not that effective anymore there

213
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,140
are some vulnerabilities within D Kim

214
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,240
but not too many and that's domainkeys

215
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,120
identified mail and then the other one

216
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,110
which if you look back to late 2017 and

217
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:55,570
to 2018 was the entire crux of certain

218
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:57,490
vendors email pitch to sell solutions

219
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,760
the federal government through binding

220
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,779
offer binding operating directive 1801

221
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:07,029
mandated that all agencies implemented d

222
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,649
mark so of course the vendors did what

223
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:12,189
vendors do and that was like their whole

224
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:15,100
marketing thing thou shalt do this some

225
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,170
social engineering in itself if they are

226
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,910
configured correctly they can stop

227
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,399
spoofing in its tracks they don't really

228
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,189
work too much against squatting unless

229
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:27,699
you explicitly define that it has to

230
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:31,899
come from this domain but at the same

231
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:34,420
time it's it works sometimes but most of

232
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,070
the time it won't so I've mentioned

233
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,680
squatting let's let's think about how

234
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,420
the squatting would work so you want to

235
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,229
know the syntax of the email addresses

236
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,319
so do they use first last or first

237
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,570
initial last name last name first in

238
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,399
middle initial what and hunter IO is

239
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,079
going to help you with that you can go

240
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,380
and look you type into the domain it'll

241
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,790
tell you hey this is the syntax used you

242
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,390
want to find out what domains they own

243
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:04,149
so if they own something dotnet and

244
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,920
the.com is available buy it if that

245
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,040
doesn't work then you can always go with

246
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,300
like dot US which that one

247
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,310
I don't really care for because you

248
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,620
can't use who is guard you must say it

249
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,569
is you but you can do some other ones

250
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,250
like TK but that's a little bit sketchy

251
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,780
because a lot of malware uses that

252
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,380
because it's a free domain but you can

253
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,790
also buy others like dot info or dot

254
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,880
life or something like that they're like

255
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:30,130
99 cents but anyway you purchase a

256
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,210
similar similar domain you determine

257
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,920
what kind of mail client you're going to

258
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,660
use you can state it up yourself you

259
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,560
could put it through your hosting

260
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,180
provider if you want to use like

261
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,010
Bluehost or something like that I

262
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,760
personally like to use Google Apps and

263
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,920
I'll explain why on the next slide but

264
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,030
it's it's definitely worth it and then

265
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,740
of course you need to wait a week a

266
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,290
couple of weeks because a lot of

267
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,850
filtering solutions look for the age of

268
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,680
the domain if the age of the domain is

269
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,230
like less than two weeks it's going to

270
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,420
drop it and I mean that's a good

271
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,880
practice but what I do is I just buy a

272
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,550
bunch of domains and then wait sometimes

273
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,800
more than a year and then I finally use

274
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,660
them for something like uh I don't

275
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,439
remember the actual top-level domain but

276
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,910
when I have is like password - reset and

277
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,060
I've used that three times and I've

278
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,969
owned it for like four years so it's

279
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,670
it's fun for that and then of course

280
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:24,150
seek and destroy so what if I told you

281
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,280
you could do all this for under $25

282
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,130
pretty easy so you get you a VPS

283
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,780
interest instance I like digitalocean

284
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:38,080
you can use a $5 box so you're not doing

285
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,510
any like hardcore web traffic you don't

286
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,130
want the public Internet to be on this

287
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,370
you don't want the bots and scanners

288
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,330
looking at it so a $5 box will be more

289
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,390
than sufficient for what you're trying

290
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,880
to do so five dollars we're there right

291
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,670
now purchase your two domains you need

292
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,290
the cinder domain for your squatting and

293
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,520
that's going to be the more expensive of

294
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,890
the two that's gonna run you probably

295
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,110
about fifteen unless you go with like a

296
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,270
dot IO which it will be like maybe

297
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,040
thirty-two I think it is but

298
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,750
nevertheless you have that and then you

299
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,089
get your landing domain something like

300
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,850
CGI - ban or password reset or something

301
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,550
like that you get it and whenever you

302
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,140
stand us up what I've done in the past

303
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,270
is I have a perfect clone of

304
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,220
SurveyMonkey and I go to the company's

305
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,360
website I still a high res logo and I

306
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,910
slap it on there asking

307
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,680
or email address and password I pass it

308
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,010
via the get request so I don't have to

309
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,560
maintain a database so it's way faster

310
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,899
to stand up I have a vanilla instance

311
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,000
that doesn't have a logo in it and the

312
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,160
the server itself I've got an ISO for it

313
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,190
so every time I do this with a customer

314
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,719
I stand up a new one

315
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,420
finish the engagement close it and then

316
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,579
next time spin up off that ISO again so

317
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,439
it's clean in that sense and I don't

318
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,910
have to stand up any database instances

319
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,920
or any of that so that definitely makes

320
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,920
life a lot easier but anyway when you do

321
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,019
this and you configure the actual Apache

322
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,260
web server piece of it you give it a

323
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:05,670
really long sub domain if you can take

324
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,450
up the whole address bar more power -

325
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,189
sometimes people are going to open it on

326
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,290
their phone so that works out there as

327
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,000
well for example if I were going to do

328
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,170
one here I would do like no lacan

329
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,240
information security conference New

330
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,510
Orleans Louisiana

331
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,529
attendee satisfaction survey CGI - Ben

332
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:28,689
dot TK so people are going to catch on

333
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,949
to it but at the end of the day when

334
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,260
we're doing these types of engagements

335
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,729
were not necessarily targeting the

336
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,250
people in this room we're targeting more

337
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,130
of the people that we seek to protect so

338
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,310
that's something to keep in mind so then

339
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,439
we we get the two domains for that what

340
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,239
you have is set up I mean we all

341
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,070
remember the time that we were told that

342
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,079
if it has the green lock it's safe right

343
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:57,220
well let's encrypt allows you to do that

344
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:58,930
for free so no additional cost there do

345
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,380
euro sent and get everything together

346
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,849
for the email portion itself the Google

347
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,230
part that adds five dollars so at this

348
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,610
rate were five dollars for Google were

349
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,790
five dollars for digitalocean

350
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,740
we're about fourteen dollars for the

351
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,149
sending domain and were like ninety nine

352
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,440
cents for the landing domain so that

353
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,640
comes to like twenty five and some

354
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,660
change depending if you have sales tax

355
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,480
and all that fun stuff so it's

356
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,640
definitely under 30 so you do that you

357
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,040
do your ascent I like to steal direct

358
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,730
quotes from press releases to put in

359
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,230
there

360
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,699
if I can catch someone with an

361
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,949
out-of-office I will actually steal

362
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:31,810
their signature as well and then when it

363
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,969
comes in it's going to come from male

364
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,630
google.com even though it's a different

365
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,430
domain the

366
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,880
incoming mail servers only going to see

367
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,250
it as mail.google.com and while that

368
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,660
could be blocked for the most part who

369
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,550
in the right mind is gonna blog Google

370
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,139
from sending inbound emails I mean

371
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,810
that's gonna shut down HR that's gonna

372
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,639
shut down a lot of other things so it's

373
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,500
just not practical so it's like what

374
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,470
you're gonna do and then of course you

375
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,740
wait so wait for the results get your

376
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:03,440
phone and profit and then go go with it

377
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,480
from there so I'm gonna pass the floor

378
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,360
over to sue all right so as far as

379
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:13,100
defense what do we do when it comes to

380
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,860
protecting our users well some of the

381
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,649
things as far as mitigation as most of

382
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,970
you know one of the weakest links in

383
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:25,610
security has been the human so I'll

384
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:32,060
start by saying that user education is

385
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:34,670
number one new and pelea campaigns make

386
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,500
sure you have a monthly for every set of

387
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,519
employees that you get targeted

388
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,560
campaigns seem to be more efficient also

389
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,630
the things that your finest Department

390
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:50,000
will fall for are not the same as the

391
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:53,120
marketing department or your HR even how

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,920
many of you have had one of their

393
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,920
employees of the security team fall for

394
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,389
a phishing

395
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,779
yeah pretty funny

396
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:08,659
I had this employee who reported the

397
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:12,380
fish thank like the link so so and also

398
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:15,020
continuous training we bought by nature

399
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,110
we get too complacent too comfortable in

400
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,439
our environment we think we know it all

401
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:24,500
and before you know it we we forget to

402
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,449
be cautious we sometimes some of us rely

403
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,240
too much on the tools I think we're

404
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,260
fully protects it so continuous trading

405
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,419
is a must

406
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:38,690
monthly if necessary tagging emails

407
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:41,299
external emails having a banner that

408
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,679
clearly states that this is an email

409
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:46,840
coming from external source

410
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:48,380
I personally from experience have seen a

411
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,980
reduced

412
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,690
success rates to our simulated phishing

413
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,990
campaign just by adding the banner

414
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,420
itself now the number of reporting

415
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:03,290
phishing will go up even for legitimate

416
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:06,080
emails but nonetheless it protects from

417
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:09,340
those fishing was at least it brings

418
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:15,070
some caution to the whole process again

419
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:19,129
properly configured DNS has been a big

420
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:22,490
points for mitigation just like Joe

421
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,680
described and I know you know most of us

422
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,400
don't know or very familiar with these

423
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:32,060
frameworks but SPF basically relies on

424
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,790
IPs it tells the organization what ip's

425
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,139
come from what domain Deacon is

426
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:40,790
basically an encryption framework that

427
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,520
basically validates which email comes

428
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:47,510
from what domain right and then you have

429
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,379
the mark who combines the two the fourth

430
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:53,830
thing that can think of us basic

431
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,300
enforcing of separation of user accounts

432
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:03,770
hopefully you're not using your admin

433
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:07,190
credential to surf the web and simple

434
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:11,210
things that can be done to mitigate and

435
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:16,790
evading phishing attacks when it comes

436
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:19,280
to detection email security tools again

437
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,830
these are products Proofpoint mimic as

438
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,629
far far I those are just example of

439
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,720
tools that you may see through our your

440
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,300
organization we by no means supports or

441
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,620
endorse these tools these are just

442
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:36,790
example of tools that help with malware

443
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:41,780
protection attachments and boxing right

444
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:44,389
URL rewriting this one will record if

445
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,389
anybody clicked on the URL if you get

446
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:51,430
allowed if it was denied if an active

447
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:54,470
blog is in place if finally you to

448
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:57,800
detects that a URL is a credential

449
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,510
harvester so then you know that everyone

450
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,549
even if they click on it it will be

451
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,040
eventually blocked

452
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:06,200
rely and your threat Intel feat better

453
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,090
threat Intel feet to the tool which

454
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,429
hopefully will email will quarantine

455
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:18,169
some emails putting blocks or permit

456
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:21,140
sender's if you notice an email address

457
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:25,820
that's targeting your ELT you can go go

458
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:28,040
and put a block for that email address

459
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,700
so that it prevents further emails from

460
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,820
targeting your elts

461
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,740
they also have spam filtering so these

462
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,450
are basic things that come with this

463
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:44,210
security tools that can be easily

464
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:47,360
implemented in the company now next Joe

465
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,309
is gonna take a shot at attempt to that

466
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,030
tribution and we really want to enforce

467
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:55,970
to fewer than if we could have made the

468
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:58,370
font any bigger for it we probably would

469
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,610
have solely on the fact of just to make

470
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,709
it more obvious that we're not saying

471
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,540
you can always do attribution depending

472
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,660
on who the adversary is if it's a very

473
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,090
complex like say nation state those of

474
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,860
you are playing buzzword bingo go ahead

475
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,459
and hit your card take a drink whatever

476
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,939
you're doing

477
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,250
but anyway depending on the complexity

478
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,580
of the adversary you may have a hard

479
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:25,010
time performing attribution you may do

480
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,020
incorrect attribution even so it's

481
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,400
something to consider but there are

482
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,660
tools out there that could help and

483
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,340
basically your best bet is to see where

484
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,960
the things exist where the

485
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,510
characteristics of this specific

486
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,880
campaign exist otherwise and you might

487
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,860
not be able to say this was Dimitri in

488
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,660
Saint Petersburg Russia doing this but

489
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,750
you can say that this is associated with

490
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,970
lucky ransomware so that's something to

491
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,419
consider and a few tools I'm all about

492
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:56,600
free so alienvault has otx there's

493
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:59,780
threat minor threat crowd passive totals

494
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,030
another one iBM has the x-force threat

495
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,290
exchange and then of course sans has the

496
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,600
internet storm center to give

497
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:10,030
information about that so at this point

498
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,030
I'm going to do a few quick demos

499
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:29,010
so put it in the slideshow momentarily

500
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:36,210
I think this max like really new I'm not

501
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:42,870
used to it yet so just trying to get to

502
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:46,950
what I'm looking for here I have not

503
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,870
done any sacrifices so what I will do is

504
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:53,730
I'll just drag and drop so we'll start

505
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:57,030
this is what I'm about to drag over is a

506
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,970
snitch that I received claiming to be

507
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:02,610
from SunTrust

508
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:07,049
the beautiful thing is I never used

509
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:09,090
SunTrust so basically I just got it

510
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:14,179
saying that something had happened with

511
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:16,980
Amazon so I did what any curious person

512
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:19,500
with too much time on their hands yet

513
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,990
overcommitted would do I open it up in

514
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,559
Cali just to see what's going on beside

515
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:27,900
Cali running so it's just going to that

516
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,980
drag and drop it into virustotal see

517
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:35,059
what's going on see if anything

518
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:41,640
identifies it as being malicious so

519
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:43,790
nothing so so this is the SunTrust site

520
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,460
to go to

521
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:49,440
when I say central site I mean site as

522
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,660
we see it's going to like eldercare

523
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,910
weekly or something which is a an

524
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,890
australian nursing home so basically

525
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,010
their site had been compromised

526
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:03,570
and this was stood up so when we run

527
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:05,100
that domain it shows up some more so now

528
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,860
we're getting it in so it's asking for a

529
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,750
user ID and password so I've got all

530
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,040
this bogus information over here let me

531
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,210
see if I can move this over a little bit

532
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,210
more so we can actually see it

533
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,639
there we go so I've got all this fake

534
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:28,070
information so I'm just copying and

535
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:40,130
pasting things in here so there's the

536
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:42,950
fake password so I also ran all this

537
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,050
stuff through burp suite and took a look

538
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,360
at the actual code behind it and there's

539
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:51,050
actually a pretty well-written piece of

540
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,419
code so honestly whoever did it was very

541
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,940
talented there's a fake credit card

542
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,860
number if you want to use it it if you

543
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,050
want to take it down it's for eight six

544
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,949
seven five three oh nine nine zero three

545
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:11,180
five seven six eight four so I fed it

546
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:14,330
some garbage there for the pin of course

547
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:17,240
1337 and and this social is actually a

548
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,649
retired while a manufacturer it's a

549
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,080
retired social because a wallet

550
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,030
manufacturer took his Secretary's social

551
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:28,340
and made copies of it to put in all the

552
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:29,840
wallets to ship out in 1938 so got that

553
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,199
information just I'm just feeding it

554
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:51,679
garbage and trying to see what it's

555
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:55,250
doing and for the email address type of

556
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,050
security at SunTrust comm so in case

557
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:02,750
they try to fish them you can get to the

558
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:10,760
right location there's a bogus address

559
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:13,270
on Rodeo Drive now it's asking for email

560
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,270
password

561
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:37,950
just go ahead drop that in there too and

562
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:39,570
then it actually redirects so so it

563
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,409
actually takes you to legit SunTrust

564
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,399
which I don't want to hate on SunTrust

565
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,549
but they probably should have been

566
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:51,209
watching for redirections into their

567
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:53,519
page so I mean I don't know how long

568
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,960
this had been stood up I may have been

569
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,399
one of the first to catch it or it may

570
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,200
have been going on for ages the fact

571
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:59,580
that virustotal had already got some

572
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,690
stuff on it I'm gonna say it probably

573
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:06,449
wasn't new but as a byproduct like

574
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:12,299
that's the rest of the domain that was

575
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:13,500
compromised so they were using so if it

576
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,220
were on virus hello I'm gonna say was

577
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:21,320
probably around for a little while but

578
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:29,159
let that be a lesson to watch your Sims

579
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:33,960
so additionally I've got some stuff here

580
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:37,200
on the web Front usually we'll do this

581
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:43,470
one first so I'm just going to show you

582
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:48,000
the yep so I'm going to show some stuff

583
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:56,629
out of recon ng if I can get my window

584
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:00,289
to shrink here trying to see if I can

585
00:27:56,629 --> 00:28:00,289
convert this over but

586
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:16,350
there we go so I move this over and here

587
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:20,880
this is just a cally box I'm already in

588
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:25,469
recon ng I've already established the

589
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:29,370
initial information so this is the MX

590
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,930
SPF IP module so all you have to do with

591
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,209
it is have an internet connection and

592
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,040
set your source in this case I'm just

593
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,880
going after the fortune one because

594
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:43,860
they're huge and this is more or less

595
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:47,580
very just looking at it is rather safe

596
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:49,679
so just like Metasploit we say run so

597
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,540
we've got some stuff so here's some net

598
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,400
blocks there's a facebook domain

599
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,930
verification adobe's and now we know

600
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,510
they use Creative Cloud it's not a

601
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,480
surprise they have Facebook there's some

602
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:03,360
IP ranges that we've got to work with

603
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:07,530
SPF record Google site verification

604
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,719
oh there's DocuSign there's something we

605
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:14,250
can use for fishing and then right here

606
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:18,930
we see this MX a and M X B all that PP

607
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:20,820
hosted is actually proof point so if we

608
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,670
were going to attempt a fishing

609
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,100
expedition against Walmart we would know

610
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,680
that we could probably use DocuSign as a

611
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,830
pretext but at the same time we should

612
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:35,160
be prepared to do battle with proof

613
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,110
point so more than likely they're either

614
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,860
going to prepend or upend the word

615
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:46,080
external so I would like to think that

616
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:48,149
that works a lot more frequently than in

617
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,550
my experience I've seen organizations

618
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,460
that do it that you're able to blow

619
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,409
right past them so it's just something

620
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,030
to keep in mind because at the end of

621
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,170
the day it all goes back to the user

622
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:03,050
training if you train the users to do it

623
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:06,240
then

624
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:08,310
then they'll they'll be your champions

625
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,100
you just have to you have to let them

626
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:13,460
know that you trust them and

627
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,529
apparently the Sevilla is not

628
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,679
cooperating so I'm just gonna do

629
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:29,610
something here you're just gonna force

630
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:35,990
quit it okay so now once I find my

631
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:38,399
cursor here we go so this is just a a

632
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,580
pulse I created based on a phishing

633
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,729
campaign it has a lot of information

634
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,439
it's on a alienvault otx in my previous

635
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,149
position I was an alien vault instructor

636
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,440
so I had to create pulses for class all

637
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:50,879
the time so I got tired of just giving

638
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,289
dummy information and just sort of

639
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:54,928
creating real ones based on what my

640
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:57,750
honey pots were seeing so here we're

641
00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:01,110
able to see there's some hashes some IP

642
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,940
addresses some URLs domains host names

643
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,320
and then as we scroll down we can just

644
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,100
see there's some hashes and some IP

645
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,620
addresses and what have you so with this

646
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:14,299
I'm gonna copy and paste this IP address

647
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:20,549
into another utility that's fun to use

648
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:22,139
called threat minor so with this it's

649
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:25,350
just looking for the host and it's going

650
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:27,809
to query other things in addition to ot

651
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,090
X it's going to geolocate it so we have

652
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:31,889
that going on here it's giving us some

653
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:35,129
information about the ASN so we can drag

654
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:37,139
and drop that into say fish tank and see

655
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:40,889
if it's still alive and active that's

656
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:42,629
fish tank comm if I recall correctly but

657
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:46,769
this was actually Google so it's

658
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:49,850
probably wrong so we can click here get

659
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:54,899
ot X there's passive total virus total

660
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:57,840
census showed an robotex all the fun

661
00:31:54,899 --> 00:32:00,899
stuff here so you can definitely look

662
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,970
and see what it's tied to we can take a

663
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:08,189
hash here and do the same thing I think

664
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:13,250
they'd accept sha-256 so with this one

665
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,250
we'll just go back and search again

666
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:29,529
so we've got the sample and right there

667
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:31,779
but it's that's the the pulse that I was

668
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:33,730
referring to so you have other things

669
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:35,230
you can look at with it as well so it's

670
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,239
just a good place to pivot like if you

671
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,100
say for example you get an email you

672
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:42,039
think it's a fish you want to do some

673
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,199
further verification for it take the

674
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:47,499
email address the IP address whatever

675
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,299
and drop it in here and it's it's not a

676
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:51,039
it's not an absolute solution but

677
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:54,279
nothing is it's just going to give you a

678
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,129
starting point so and then the other

679
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,869
thing I mentioned was hunter IO so in

680
00:32:57,129 --> 00:33:01,988
this case we'll just take a look at

681
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:03,220
Walmart I'm logged in so you have to

682
00:33:01,989 --> 00:33:06,639
have an account but like I said it's

683
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,720
free well I have a free account so here

684
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:15,840
it's just going to query waiting and

685
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,039
waiting and waiting and we have

686
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,359
sometimes we have a job title but we at

687
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,820
least have a name and an email address

688
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,428
so I'm going to go ahead and close that

689
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,428
one quick just so that I don't know you

690
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,190
can find the link then exactly it's

691
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,869
pretty accurate with your fishing

692
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,999
exactly and the only reason I closed

693
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:35,470
that so quickly is just because I don't

694
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:39,970
like the idea of potentially doxing

695
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:45,100
people so so back to the actual

696
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:46,299
presentation really quickly I'm the

697
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,969
co-founder through the hack and glass

698
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:51,129
it's a mentoring platform basically it's

699
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,749
aiming to bridge the gap between what

700
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,879
you learn in academia and what you get

701
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:58,210
from certifications and what industry

702
00:33:54,879 --> 00:34:01,168
wants I can't guarantee that we'll give

703
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:04,029
you 14 years of aetherium experience but

704
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:05,489
we will certainly give you experience in

705
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:09,520
something we're working with vendors to

706
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:11,109
get NFR licenses so that you can

707
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,000
actually use things that you would use

708
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:14,679
in the field and we're not allowing the

709
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,929
salespeople to try to sell to you we're

710
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,679
just saying hey this is what you're up

711
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,700
to

712
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,609
so on twitter at hacking glass

713
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:28,239
facebook.com slash hacking glass the

714
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:29,830
link we are using a mil chimp mailing

715
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,060
list to

716
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,400
or everything right now in terms of

717
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:36,580
membership so the link is on both

718
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,190
Twitter and Facebook also we're in dire

719
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,299
need of mentors we've got about a 13 to

720
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:45,400
one mentee to mentor ratio right now so

721
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,560
we need people to be mentors you can be

722
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,710
a mentor and a mentee but we we

723
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:54,130
definitely need more mentors so that we

724
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,170
don't have to do it in cohorts my

725
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:59,170
upcoming speaking engagements I'm given

726
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:02,650
training the first of June at layer

727
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,540
eight and then also nearby we've got

728
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,510
hacker halted and I'll be at the Texas

729
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,250
cyber summit as well with hacker vaulted

730
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,750

731
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,870

733
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,950
note of it share it with whoever you

734
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,550
want keynotes actually in the audience

735
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:24,279
Jeff man will be speaking but keynotes

736
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:26,650

737

Coldwater and there's a couple more that

738
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,700
I just can't think of off the top of my

739
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,110
head so it's gonna be good and then

740
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,109
there's a coupon code for training as

741
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:37,980
well so the days leading into the event

742
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:43,570
they'll have all of their certifications

743
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:46,060
for training also with the training on

744
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:50,200
June 7th you will get admission to layer

745
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:54,279
eight the eights silent in the slide it

746
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,049
was taking a break but anyway the

747
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,490
training day is a June 7th it's an

748
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,890
eight-hour social engineering and open

749
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,080
source intelligence course the

750
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,240
information to do that is at the bottom

751
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,549
and I mean if there was just like this

752
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,990
I mean Northern Virginia is such a good

753
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,590
place for a conference I just can't

754
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,919
think of anything to go with it so

755
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,990
alright

756
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:22,300
these guys know our next conference is

757
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:24,160
next year mar 16 2015 8 to know CFP will

758
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:28,200

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,629
until January 6 will have submissions so

760
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,879

can also find us at besides Nevada org

762
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:41,080
and on Twitter with that we are opening

763
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:44,500
the floor to questions

764
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,259
and to jumpstart that I would like to

765
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,930
query the audience to tell me what are

766
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:56,430
some other good fish that they've seen

767
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:56,430
out there anyone should I call on things

768
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:08,680
hi-yah wah wah

769
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,940
those are definitely crafty and for

770
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,299
those who couldn't hear me was just

771
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:22,120
talking about reusing old emails as a

772
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:23,920
current fish anyone else a good one that

773
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,380
I've seen that been very efficient is

774
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,020
from the HR department saying they've

775
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,450
changed their rules on what you can and

776
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,130
cannot post on Twitter employees are so

777
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,350
freaked out they don't even think twice

778
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,570
they click on the link to see where the

779
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:40,230
rules yeah we've got a few people at

780
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:59,080
that point anyone has any fun stories

781
00:37:40,230 --> 00:38:03,160
judgment I'm calling on you yeah that is

782
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:20,440
I probably sent that one yeah most

783
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:22,899
likely spanked news so went one that

784
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,970
I've always wanted to do but I've never

785
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,980
got anyone to agree to actually let me

786
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,410
do it is I just want to spam people like

787
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,290
every day for like a month with like

788
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,879
this bogus newsletter and purposely not

789
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:36,340
have an unsubscribe button at the bottom

790
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,170
and then whenever I finally choose to do

791
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,970
it I'm going to send an email

792
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,010
apologizing for being in violation of

793
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:45,700
the USA can spam Act and say click here

794
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:47,380
to unsubscribe oh that is a good one

795
00:38:45,700 --> 00:39:04,180
then think about that

796
00:38:47,380 --> 00:39:06,700
yes something like that's just so over

797
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,779
the top it's like when like when I'm

798
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:13,870
planning something like that I'm like

799
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:14,860
their users can't be that naive right

800
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:21,810
exactly

801
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:24,100
well I mean I'm not saying I think so

802
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:26,920
like a story about a really good

803
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:29,950
campaign that I ran so according to the

804
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:33,070
semantics is tr the global average rate

805
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:37,140
is like 13% so with this campaign I got

806
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:40,570
42% and this is after I only got about

807
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,180
60% of the emails out and got blocked

808
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,280
three hours in so it was a grocery chain

809
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,319
it was not Walmart I'll tell you that

810
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,350
now it was a small grocery chain in a

811
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,400
regional area their CEO was retiring the

812
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:55,810
next week and the CEO was taking over so

813
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,520
basically I went out I found some press

814
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,130
releases I copied and pasted it in there

815
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,080
I bought the us to there.com

816
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,020
did all the infrastructure with what I

817
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,240
was talking about the $25 deal stood it

818
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,310
up sent the email out one thing that was

819
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,600
really notable similar to Walmart they

820
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,430
didn't call their employees employees it

821
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,220
was like it was like member owner or

822
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,509
something I don't remember well that for

823
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,919
Walmart its associates but for this

824
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,930
company it was like member owner or

825
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,660
something to that effect and basically I

826
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,089
just sent him low and slow like 10 to 15

827
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,609
at a time and I would wait a few minutes

828
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,410
in between each one I got it about 60%

829
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,870
of them out and then I started getting

830
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,629
bounced s blocks and I was like hmm so

831
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:37,270
then my security point of contact

832
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:40,420
forwards me what their network head had

833
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:42,100
sent out to everyone well then when they

834
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:46,540
they forwarded the email and said don't

835
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:49,270
click this look what is it that I'm not

836
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,370
supposed to click let me click in to see

837
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,840
what I don't need to click and what it

838
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,069
was is it had the MailChimp the first

839
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,020
page was what's your email address and

840
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,490
password and the next page was like

841
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,750
password reset questions like your

842
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,830
mother's maiden name your school but I

843
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,420
never asked the mother's maiden name

844
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,859
anyone who sees me on

845
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,450
Street you'll see me asking questions

846
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:06,190
like hey what was your mom's name before

847
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,919
she was married and like in the South

848
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,660
like I'm from Tennessee I'll just roll

849
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,220
up with some baby like who's your mama's

850
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:16,509
people works like a champ it might even

851
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:20,529
work out on Bourbon Street I might have

852
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:22,780
to try that tonight but anyway with that

853
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:24,760
I ask those questions on the third page

854
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,290
is originally a logic flaw it was like

855
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,970
an infinite loop on that third page that

856
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,079
said sorry the survey is closed and

857
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,490
originally I was like do I want to fix

858
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,079
this

859
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,540
maybe I was like no I want someone to

860
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,359
report me and I think that may have been

861
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,529
what saved him and then I waited a

862
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,660
couple of weeks and I was closing the

863
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,309
account out I had already taken down the

864
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,629
web server but I was closing out the

865
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:46,030
Google account before I got billed for a

866
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,000
second month I mean you know five

867
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:53,799
dollars is hard to come by sometimes but

868
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,579
anyway the now CEO of whom I had spooked

869
00:41:53,799 --> 00:42:00,790
well squatted was on seven internal

870
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:03,609
ultra-sensitive mailing lists and it was

871
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:05,710
going to the wrong account I had this

872
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:08,230
done this guy scheduled I saw like

873
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:10,780
confidential company information got

874
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:13,089
meeting invites I just forwarded it to

875
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,369
the the company that my point of contact

876
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:17,170
I'm not gonna say what he said but it

877
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:21,369
rhymes with something that might walk

878
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:24,990
and sound like a duck and he was rather

879
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:27,040
concerned about that so and then

880
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:29,680
basically after that they had everybody

881
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,569
reset their password and I stood

882
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,629
everything up for password reset dot

883
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:37,119
whatever it is and they're like okay in

884
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:40,270
60 days come pitch us a new fish okay

885
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,220
cool and I pitched it I wrote everything

886
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,049
up I sent it

887
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,140
I made my vice president aware cuz this

888
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:49,119
was a previous position and I had gotten

889
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,910
on his bad side somehow I'm not sure to

890
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,109
be honest he calls me by to come to his

891
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,240
office I was like oh boy I'm in trouble

892
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,670
again what have I done so I go there

893
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,279
he's like they're not going with your

894
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,960
fish

895
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,730
because what it was was I was going to

896
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,400
say something to the effect of as some

897
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:07,860
of you may know approximately 60 days

898
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,450
ago malicious adversary ran a phishing

899
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,460
campaign and compromised some some

900
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,859
credentials so we subscribe to a service

901
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,930
that watches the dark web for our

902
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,190
passwords and everyone in the

903
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:19,009
organization's passwords had been

904
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:22,200
compromised to click here to reset it

905
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:28,070
and that hence the password reset dot

906
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,069
whatever the TLD is so yeah they said no

907
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:35,370
but oh easily and I'm pretty sure the

908
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,780
network guy was actually one of them

909
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:38,640
that fell for the original fish so

910
00:43:36,780 --> 00:44:05,150
that's probably why he blocked me so

911
00:43:38,640 --> 00:44:05,150
quick yes Jeff whether sinister yes

912
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,359
[Music]

913
00:44:54,990 --> 00:45:11,649
we're removing all that money spent on a

914
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:13,120
PhD so I don't understand the whole

915
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,830
thing about the Apple gift card somebody

916
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,240
in the audience may actually know but

917
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,620
like what are these people do like just

918
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:25,870
get the gift cards and like run some

919
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:31,589
like fake app and my fishing game is

920
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:31,589
about to change right

921
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,910
I was like yeah cuz I was like Apple

922
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,680
musics 9 bucks a month and you can

923
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:41,890
listen to whatever why do you need like

924
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,540
do you have like you know 50 people who

925
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:47,830
want to listen to you know Lynyrd

926
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:51,120
Skynyrd all the time so I don't know we

927
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,120
got a little bit more time anyone else

928
00:45:51,450 --> 00:46:02,859
if not then that's all folks well we do

929
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:16,960
have a lot yes there definitely a

930
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:18,460
tempting okay so with within the email

931
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,750
if you're receiving the email there's a

932
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,320
good chance someone else is receiving

933
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,090
the email so by using things like otx

934
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,890
like threat minor like threat crowd I

935
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,510
would say start at threat minor and then

936
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,920
just use it to pivot out because it's

937
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,290
connected to everything else except for

938
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,990
I don't think it's tied into IBM's but

939
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,870
it's there to and there I mean there are

940
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,569
others out there as well but basically

941
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,890
you can take the source of the email

942
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:44,530
look at the email address that it

943
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:47,290
proposed the claims to be the where it

944
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:49,840
actually came from the IP address that

945
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:53,050
it came from all that fun stuff drop it

946
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:56,650
in there and then see what is this tied

947
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:58,570
to so things like like lucky the exploit

948
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,650
kid associated with lucky there was a

949
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:02,170
huge phishing campaign that actually

950
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,240
deployed that so there were a lot of

951
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:06,820
things that were very similar in the

952
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,509
deployments of that exploit kit so in

953
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:12,410
doing so by having that

954
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:14,750
or the like the hash of anything that

955
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:17,210
they try to get you to download then

956
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,710
you're able to say yes this is you're

957
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,730
basically looking for a signature to see

958
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,440
if someone else has already done the

959
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,880
analysis if you're the one

960
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,380
groundbreaking the analysis that might

961
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,609
be a little bit different but I mean if

962
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,840
you're groundbreaking you might even be

963
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:34,009
able to find some malware that's never

964
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:35,180
been seen before and name it so that's

965
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,369
basically that's what you're doing like

966
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,540
is operating under the idea of if I'm

967
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:40,070
having this problem someone else is

968
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,259
probably having this problem the same

969
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:45,440
reason why I love doing a Centon like

970
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:47,770
Stack Overflow or looking at like

971
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,869
mailing lists that have since been

972
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:54,410
archived into a website during the Derby

973
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:56,270
con SC CTF I found that my target

974
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,589
company was using a specific storage

975
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,990
array and they had been having problems

976
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:01,520
because the guy did not take his his

977
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:04,089
signature line out

978
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,600
he didn't even work there anymore but

979
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:13,790
