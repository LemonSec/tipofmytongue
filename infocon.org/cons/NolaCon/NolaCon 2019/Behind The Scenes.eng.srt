challenges some it starts easy but it

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:03,640
gets really hard for people who put

89
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,640
points on the board

90
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,190

I don't you ever seen them but Macy's

110
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,230
ideas to be unpickable because you can't

111
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,229
actually get to where the pins are

112
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,120
big stuff

113
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,799
[Music]

114
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:24,170
[Music]

115
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,230
okay it's Sunday and we're about to

116
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:49,630
start day three of no Lacan 2019 okay

117
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,940
well here at the registration desk at no

118
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,620
Lacan and the some weird white powdery

119
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,940
substance everyplace we're not quite

120
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,670
sure what it is we're doing

121
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:03,060
investigation and the vein is broken out

122
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,060
cleansing the streets

123
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,710
a good thunderstorm is like nature's

124
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,150
air-conditioning

125
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,420
we are now technically post no Lacan

126
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:33,199
2019 so made my annual trip to Lee pace

127
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,719
to get a chimichanga okay as I said

128
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,630
before no Lacan is officially over for

129
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,150
2019 but I'm still here hearing it out I

130
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,680
highly recommend you spend an extra day

131
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,480
leave or late on Monday if you can

132
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,420
because it's lab cool stuff to see

133
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,890
around the French Quarter which is what

134
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,760
I'm going to try to show you probably in

135
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,080
the next few segments since I plan on

136
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,390
doing more recording on Bourbon Street

137
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,050
tomorrow I figured I'd walk along the

138
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,000
waterfront here in New Orleans and give

139
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,750
you a little bit of a taste of that it

140
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,750
is awfully pretty

141
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,900
steamboat seemed like a lot of fun I've

142
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,510
been thinking about doing an a sides

143
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,939
Louisville well we essentially rent out

144
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,250
the Belle of Louisville and have an

145
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,930
eighth sides were essentially you have

146
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,400
to get at the boat at a certain time but

147
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,229
then just travel up and down the Ohio

148
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,439
River for a bit giving talks we all

149
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,440
think

150
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:39,219
this whole putting street names on the

151
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,930
ground here in New Orleans is a great

152
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,430
idea especially if someone happens to be

153
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,560
in New Orleans really drunk and crawling

154
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,900
back to the hotel it really helps them

155
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,890
to be at the right eye level view to be

156
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,709
able to figure out which way they're

157
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:53,949
going a little background history of the

158
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:56,920
city I'm in and here's the original

159
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,780
French market coffee stand cafe and you

160
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,849
do want if you want somethin a is this

161
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,770
the place to go plenty of powdered sugar

162
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,050
dough start you hack o types who are

163
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,699
black shirts everywhere you may work

164
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,439
change to something like in white Oh

165
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,330
gray before you come here to eat because

166
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,330
you will get powdered sugar all over you

167
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,920
[Music]

168
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,530
figured I'd give you all a little bit of

169
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,020
Jackson Square actions it's often nice

170
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,819
here there's a restaurant someplace

171
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,640
often huh

172
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,310
in this corner area that I went to last

173
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,880
year as well hung out with me and that

174
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:36,780
was some good stuff but looks like a

175
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,780
pretty place to hang out

176
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,200
what's up ever drat

177
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,280
they love the pralines here

178
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,870
if you ever wonder where mr. bot gets

179
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,360
all his little miniature hands control

180
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,400
people with it well at least at no lacan

181
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,670
freaky actually order some he gets in

182
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:28,280
here at rocket fizz plenty of eclectic

183
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:30,459
sodas and candies and other stuff like

184
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,459
those

185
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,740
some co-workers said I should bring back

186
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:51,000
some hot sauce here from New Orleans so

187
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,000
let's see we got inside of here

188
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,290
yeah I don't think I wanna go that high

189
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:19,488
thank you so much baby go home I have a

190
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:19,488
great night

191
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:41,930
Royal Street this is the place where a

192
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:43,130
lot of times you might want to heat just

193
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,719
recording it because it's real pretty

194
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:50,050
building I like this one a whole lot eat

195
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,050
also

196
00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:00,520
place always seems closed if you want to

197
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:06,130
come look at various uh cool historical

198
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,780
arms Royal Street 4:37 neat stuff I

199
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,480
think they put away some of the stuff at

200
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:13,360
night but you want to see old swords old

201
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,120
knives muzzle loaders and so forth this

202
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,540
is a pretty cool store to visit up ahead

203
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,030
of us

204
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,189
we got Britain's now Britain is the

205
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,250
original home of Bananas Foster as I

206
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,120
understand it I've ate to a few times

207
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,250
definitely want to call ahead for

208
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,740
reservations however to make sure you

209
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,380
can get a seat and I'll go ahead and

210
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,400
record some of that here in a second

211
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,510
world street is really pretty and it's

212
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,250
probably one of the better places to eat

213
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,250
when you're here at no lacan

214
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,780
still here on Royal Street as you can

215
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,310
see there's a whole lot of police

216
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,560
presence in the French Quarter they want

217
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,839
to make sure that the tourist money

218
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,399
keeps coming in so generally speaking it

219
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,169
seems the French Quarter is relatively

220
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,610
safe

221
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,610
everybody's Molitor a very I suppose

222
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:19,260
here we have old absinthe house

223
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,630
now if you like the whole absinthe

224
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,910
ritual where they put the sugar cube on

225
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,010
the knife and they pour anything over it

226
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:30,420
light it on fire all that stuff this is

227
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:35,040
a good place to come by okay this is my

228
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,510
anti myspace angles shot just got back

229
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,580
from walking around and I'm awfully glad

230
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,250
I modified my air conditioner to suppose

231
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,389
they go down to 50 degrees unfortunately

232
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,120
because of all the rooms around me I

233
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,549
suppose it's only coming down to about

234
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,840
65 but oh man it's so much nicer to be

235
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:53,309
here oh lovely in here and the rain

236
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,928
earlier in the day was nice for cooling

237
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:56,399
everything off but now it's a little bit

238
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:57,840
muggy outside so I think I'll stay

239
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,669
inside the hotel until it gets dark

240
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,668
outside catch you later

241
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,740
all right according to the trekkers

242
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,689
guide to New Orleans 204 Decatur Street

243
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,790
should be the closest to where Cisco's

244
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,380
dad's restaurant would be even though

245
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,800
the descriptions in the various episodes

246
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,630
make it to be in walking distance of

247
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,580
Audubon Park there is early innocent

248
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,280
places in modern-day New Orleans that's

249
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:43,428
that much in walking distance of Audubon

250
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:45,678
Park we found some bugs at no laqad but

251
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:48,110
do my annual walk all the way up and all

252
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,440
the way back down Bourbon Street see

253
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,439
what I see

254
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,470
what exactly is a biggie I'm confused

255
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,470
it this is very pretty courtyard enero

256
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:35,100
I do enjoy Bourbon Street keep in mind

257
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:39,030
that a large portion of the stores here

258
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,850
seem to be well selling slushies by the

259
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:44,430
slice pizza holdout of Voodoo shops and

260
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,939
so forth booths a very sorority and of

261
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:51,360
course strip clubs galore which are more

262
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,760
down that direction really love the

263
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,959
architecture though

264
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,129
don't let sarah silverman see all the

265
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,900
road signs who knows what you'll think

266
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,280
this is a cool little bar it's currently

267
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,220
closed I got up earlier enough to where

268
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,970
I didn't have to do it the worst of the

269
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:11,370
heat but supposedly this was a

270
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,630
blacksmith shop originally owned by one

271
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,629
of the famous pirates in the area

272
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:38,409
head across the street to get back in

273
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:38,408
the shade it's a cool looking building

274
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,189
as you get further down Bourbon Street

275
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,350
things become a lot more residential

276
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,940
most of the stuff that sort of stores is

277
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,500
concerned is sort of in like the first

278
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,500
half mile away from Canal Street

279
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,280
getting close to the end of Bourbon

280
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:06,950
Street not quite there yet gotten down

281
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:11,580
to about the end of Bourbon Street

282
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:22,260
splits up up here and it's about a mile

283
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:23,428
or so I guess grand total as you can see

284
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:32,370
by time you get to this end it's pretty

285
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:33,510
much all residential getting is more

286
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,070
video the building just cuz I really

287
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:41,280
like it

288
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:43,939
apparently there's a hotel also the

289
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,940
funky pirate

290
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,580
keep in mind Bourbon Street is almost

291
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,790
always under construction of some kind

292
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,790
or another

293
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,250
this is the fourth time I've been to New

294
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,409
Orleans and I've never been actually

295
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,000
inside of Armstrong Park so I think I'd

296
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,000
give it a shot and take a look

297
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,919
I'm not doing a portal right now I wish

298
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,010
they would cuz then you could see a

299
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:27,080
bunch of squirming crawfish in this tray

300
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,080
here but it does smell great

301
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,580
well the trip is essentially over just

302
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,690
waiting for my flight back hopefully see

303
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,689
y'all at know Lakan next year
