about how we can build empathy amongst

6
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,820
our product and our technology peers for

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,669
those that don't know me

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,800

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,169
nice to be here and I definitely chat

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,659
the opportunity to come and talk with

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,000
you about this so here's what we're

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,170
going to be covering today we're going

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,940
to start off with a little bit of my

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,100
favorite subject me I do like to joke

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,780
around and you know we'll talk a little

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,860
bit more about a day in my life and kind

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,380
of the things that I'm hearing from

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,119
developers that I work with next thing

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,460
we'll go into a little bit is is talk

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,229
about why is it that we're still seeing

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,029
the same and hearing the same issues

23
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,640
coming up from developer communities and

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,200
from our product communities 20 years

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,700
later right we're still seeing

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,429
cross-site scripting we're still seeing

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,560
you know sqli we're still seeing default

28
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:27,420
passwords everywhere it's not like we

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,979
haven't been saying don't do it so the

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,229
question becomes what's what are we not

31
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,250
saying that we should be saying and who

32
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,159
are the people that we should be talking

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,840
to instead and then I want to play a

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,939
little game with with y'all folks it's

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,220
Saturday at 3 o'clock I can't think of a

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,570
better way to spend spend the day and

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,579
then to play a little bit of dungeon and

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,710
Dungeon Dungeons & Dragons when we play

39
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,240
a game called dungeon master of

40
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,270
engineering if you if you've heard of

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,829
that and then finally we're going to go

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,089
through and talk to you what I learned

43
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,889
having gone through the same exercise

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,570
I'm going to put you all through this

45
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,890
afternoon and then finally we'll finish

46
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,820
up with just the recommendations hmm ok

47
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,469
so again my name is Yolanda Smith I

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,449
spent 8 years in the United States Air

49
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,630
Force where I learned on my leet cyber

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,459
skills I joined the Air Force because I

51
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,980
was interested in that frankly the Air

52
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,260
Force was the only service at the time

53
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,798
that was taking cyber warfare and cyber

54
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,510
operations seriously and they were nice

55
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,359
enough to actually let me do it for 8

56
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,858
years and I had the chance to work on

57
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:31,500
some pretty interesting projects and

58
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:34,379
programs on non-traditional platforms

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,160
including the predator weapon system but

60
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,890
what they say

61
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,720
in the airforce is that when you aren't

62
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,339
having any more fun than you should you

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,730
should stop doing it so that's exactly

64
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,940
what I did and I decided to take my

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,540
Texas self and move from San Antonio up

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,280
to Boston where I became a part of the

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,230
manager at a cyber security company

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,570
called Pony Express see some head nods

69
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,750
out there I see a couple alumni out

70
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:05,670
there too so it says recovering for a

71
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:08,370
reason that is a hard job y'all product

72
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,200
managers are responsible for listening

73
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,080
listening to the market listening to

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,149
data listening to our engineering team

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,360
listening to what the board wants our

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,640
job is to listen and take all of those

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,130
data feeds and that feedback and turn it

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,369
into something that can actually help a

79
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,440
customer solve a problem in doing that I

80
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,800
had the opportunity to talk with a lot

81
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,620
of larger companies one of those

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,620
companies happen to be Target and in

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,630
talking with target the CSO pulled me

84
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,510
aside and said hey what's your what's

85
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:46,950
your long-term game plan and I said well

86
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,480
I want your job sir and he was he was

87
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,070
like well if you want my job then you

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,649
got to come work where I work and so

89
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,600
that's how I landed in Minneapolis so I

90
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,160
took my my Boston accent I picked my

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,609
arse back up

92
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,560
threw them back into the chowder and

93
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,900
made my way over to a Minneapolis where

94
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,640
that's where I am today

95
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,590
so when my role as an info SEC analyst

96
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,760
at Target one of the things that I get

97
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,770
to do one of the many things I get to do

98
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,570
is work with developers specifically

99
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,540
looking at target.com

100
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,010
and our mobile platforms so when you log

101
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,730
in at Target calm you're gonna hit

102
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,890
something like 1.8 million webpages that

103
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,090
are generated over time so in a matter

104
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,110
of four seconds each of those web pages

105
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,789
is something that I have had a

106
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,860
conversation with a developer maybe not

107
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,810
1.8 million conversations but how they

108
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,390
happen I've had a conversation with a

109
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,550
developer a product manager a business

110
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,530
analyst somewhere somebody's asked me

111
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,840
about hey this is a site secure as a

112
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,099
site safe you might have heard about a

113
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,010
little thing that happened to target a

114
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,690
few years ago rest assure I was not

115
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,250
there when that happened

116
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,610
I was not there when that happened it

117
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,950
did not impact the the website and and

118
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,560
frankly I will say that target has

119
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,479
learned a quite a lesson and it's built

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,510
an elite team around making sure that

121
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,610
that doesn't ever happen again so that

122
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,039
being said you know we are a team made

123
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,740
up of people and one of the things that

124
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,050
I hear amongst our developer teams that

125
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,720
I work with is you know they get a

126
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,960
finding and that finding is something

127
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,390
along the lines of hey you you have you

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,020
have a bad cert right serving up your

129
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,210
your application and routinely I'll get

130
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,000
what I call the Narnian defense it's a

131
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,620
made-up place it's a made-up thing you

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
know you're just gonna tell me whatever

133
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,640
you have to tell me to get me out of

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,260
your face right so I get though that's

135
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,349
handled someplace else downstream

136
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,760
upstream someplace that I don't know but

137
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,420
it's not my fault and I don't want to

138
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,849
talk about it

139
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,250
right that's the Narnia defense the

140
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,470
other thing I hear a lot is where does

141
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,780
it say we have to do that right that's

142
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,370
the the willful ignorance defense right

143
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,719
where I know that you took your

144
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,510
information security awareness training

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,000
I know that you went through and and you

146
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,190
you saw that the CIO said thou shalt do

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,790
but because it's not written in front of

148
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,010
you right now

149
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,670
it somehow means that you don't have to

150
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:11,370
do that so I call that willful ignorance

151
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,560
the other one I hear quite a bit is the

152
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,290
what I call the complete abject denial

153
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,510
and delusion where we say is this really

154
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,130
that big of a problem what's the

155
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,320
likelihood that somebody's ever going to

156
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,090
figure out that if they type in that

157
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,250
exact string of characters on our guest

158
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,239
facing web page that is going to lead to

159
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,590
a domme side cross-site scripting attack

160
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,300
all of those things have happened they

161
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,590
happen fairly regularly and when I talk

162
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,170
to my peers who are looking at other

163
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,330
aspects of target's ecosystem are a

164
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:44,790
common feedback that we give to them is

165
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:46,349
okay sure Jan and it's because we all

166
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,570
know the folks in this room all know

167
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,160
that hackers don't care they don't care

168
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,300
if it's something small they don't care

169
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,340
if it's something big they don't care if

170
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,750
you can make a case of the business it's

171
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,890
going to get exploited and then it's

172
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,200
going to get pivoted and it's got to

173
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,719
admit to something else right put the

174
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,039
fact that 20 years later

175
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,430
I'm not going to date myself and say the

176
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,790
first time I heard that that the cross

177
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,960
side scripting was a bad thing but some

178
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,860
number of years ago we we started saying

179
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
hey stop doing

180
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,480
stop putting default passwords stop

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,240
using password one two three four five

182
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,800
six start stop running everything is

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,900
route and start using principle of least

184
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,680
privilege and yet we're still seeing

185
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,929
even today that in 2018 the most common

186
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,530
password was password one two three four

187
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,420
five six even today and we're still

188
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:43,119
seeing breaches where you know someone

189
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:45,700
has full plaintext passwords exposed is

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,230
sitting in s3 buckets right we haven't

191
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,060
necessarily changed the threat we've

192
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,390
changed where it lives now it was in the

193
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,460
cloud instead of on a desktop so we're

194
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,780
saying the same things it's the same

195
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,250
threats and the same issues are ending

196
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,830
up in different places which leads me to

197
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,540
ask the question are we've not saying it

198
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,099
right are we saying it's the wrong way

199
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,110
or he's not using the right language are

200
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,630
we not saying we're not talking to the

201
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,390
right folks are we the baddies and this

202
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:14,080
narrative are we the ones that are the

203
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,039
problem I think we might be part of the

204
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,099
problem and I think we're the whole

205
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,060
problem and just like I've already said

206
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,060
we've seen that we've gone from

207
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,650
waterfall to agile and and and we've

208
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,720
gone from local development server list

209
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,520
operations and yet we're still having

210
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,780
issues where people are how I have the

211
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,179
ability to very quickly do privilege

212
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,000
escalation and things like that but why

213
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:40,150
is that when you start to look at what's

214
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,820
actually happening to allow that to go

215
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,949
on and try and pull together well

216
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,630
security says this there's a plenty of

217
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,400
guidance where security says don't do it

218
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,110
this way but then when you look at the

219
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,699
developer communities and the dots and

220
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,290
things like that sometimes it's

221
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,600
contradictory sometimes it's vague

222
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,240
sometimes it's outdated or or

223
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,430
condescending and I don't know about you

224
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,200
but if you spent a long time working on

225
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,180
something and then somebody comes along

226
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,580
at the eleventh hour and tells you it

227
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,079
sucks it's wrong do it again you're

228
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,290
probably going to throw up some walls

229
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,589
right so I think that that defensiveness

230
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,430
that innate that desire just to get

231
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:16,750
something done

232
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,739
and and we'll figure out the security

233
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,750
later it comes from that that the basis

234
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,160
of not necessarily having a good

235
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,899
relationship to begin with and not

236
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,850
Caesarea speaking the same language to

237
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,960
begin with

238
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,300
the other thing that I find is that

239
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,430
because we're so busy and it's

240
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,399
particularly insecurity playing catch-up

241
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,829
that we that the security tools and

242
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,300
metrics and blinky boxes and and funny

243
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,520
lights and all these things that we have

244
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,290
end up being built around the products

245
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,209
because the products already out it's

246
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,310
already been fielded and now we have to

247
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:51,670
get it from prod and figure out how to

248
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,819
secure it you know while it's lie right

249
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:58,660
so now we've got all of the SAS products

250
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:02,080
and all of the antivirus and edy ours

251
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,420
and all these things and to add around

252
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,190
the product and report back out so RC so

253
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,439
but none of that stuff actually feeds

254
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,790
into the product none of nor does it

255
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,110
actually help the product become

256
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,490
successful or do what it's designed to

257
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:20,170
do so I think maybe we're still making

258
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,700
this too hard I think that we could

259
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,279
figure out ways to communicate

260
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,279
differently to our developer teammates

261
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,260
and to our product teammates and just to

262
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,050
give you an example of how we might be

263
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,480
making this too hard this is this

264
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,390
incident happened fairly recently we had

265
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,600
a developer that got a task to fix an

266
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,850
issue with method override so I'll just

267
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,040
read what he says if you can't see in

268
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,170
the back he said we got a finding about

269
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,000
method override but the recommendations

270
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,560
in the report weren't useful so I

271
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,500
decided to do some independent research

272
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,599
to see if I could figure it out I ended

273
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,950
up even more confused and I still don't

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,820
know how to prevent method override

275
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:03,190
abuse I feel like I wasted valuable time

276
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,140
so with my product manager hat on I can

277
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,810
tell you that the key the KPI therefore

278
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,720
for product managers is is revenue the

279
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,760
KPI for developers is time I want to go

280
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,829
faster I want to I want to have quality

281
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,209
code and I want to be able to deliver it

282
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,640
in a way that's going to be resilient

283
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,579
easy to service and maintain so when I

284
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,800
see I heard this person say I wasted

285
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,359
valuable time it was like he told me

286
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,699
that he was pushed out of a moving car

287
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,290
and then the car backed up at ran over

288
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,639
him and then

289
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,500
they spat on him a little bit though

290
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,810
that's that's a gut punch right that

291
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,550
that means that he was not able to do

292
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,569
the core thing that he's able to do and

293
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,430
that's maximize the use of his time so

294
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,070
and I'm gonna actually pick apart the

295
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,880
the the real finding that that he got

296
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,319
this came from an automated da scan what

297
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,139
he was looking for is a concise

298
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:55,149
explanation of why method overrides a

299
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,459
problem and what methods are considered

300
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:00,009
dangerous and really where he should be

301
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,599
looking to fix it right so if you don't

302
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:04,199
know what method override is it's just a

303
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,139
condition where you have the ability to

304
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:10,599
take verbs like put and poem patch and

305
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:12,069
delete and actually go beyond just to

306
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,060
get and post verbs that are that are

307
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:17,560
natively there in AC and AC TP there's a

308
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,439
really good valid reason why you might

309
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,439
want to use put and patch and potent and

310
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,180
delete right in our particular case we

311
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,149
needed to be able to give guests the

312
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,310
ability to modify their reviews and we

313
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,810
wanted to give us the ability to delete

314
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,388
reviews if they wanted to

315
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,779
however this showed up as a high finding

316
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:39,850
in his desk report for us at target a

317
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,220
high binding gets the gets the attention

318
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,470
of some very high-level senior leaders

319
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,240
right if it's not resolved it doesn't

320
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,760
look like anyone's taking action it's

321
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,329
actually going to get get up to the

322
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,939
CSO's attention so when he sees this he

323
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:56,529
wants to fix it and fix it now and get

324
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,079
it off of his plate move on to something

325
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,389
else in his backlog but when we look at

326
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,239
the actual and verbage in the finding it

327
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:06,490
said this so attackers may bypass server

328
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,649
protection against dangerous a CTP verbs

329
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,029
using override techniques that's not so

330
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,069
bad that's pretty straightforward I get

331
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,350
that but then the next piece that says

332
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:17,050
is the attack works by using trusted

333
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,959
HTTP verbs such as get or post but ads

334
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,779
request headers such as X a CTP method X

335
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,430
a CTP override or X over X method

336
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:27,160
override to provide a restricted verbs

337
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,229
such as put or delete doing so will

338
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,449
force the request to be interpreted by

339
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,310
the target application using the verb in

340
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:35,560
the request header instead of the actual

341
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,510
HTTP verb in certain cases the

342
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,279
restricted verb may also be used in

343
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,660
query or post parameters instead of a

344
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,660
request header now

345
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,839
what in the eff does that mean like I

346
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:51,089
mean let me just think about this is if

347
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,880
you hadn't already if you hadn't gotten

348
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:54,959
used to seeing gas reports and and this

349
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,910
was maybe the first time you're having

350
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,430
to deal with method override abuse where

351
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,839
would you know to fix that issue what

352
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,120
would be the first step you would take

353
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,950
do you fix it in the overwrite in the in

354
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,410
the headers does that solve it across

355
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:11,760
the board do you fix it at the at the

356
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,800
CDN do you fix it at your API gateway

357
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,420
where do you go about actually resolving

358
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,459
this issue and then if you do all of

359
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,719
that is that actually solved the problem

360
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,899
because now it looks like I have to look

361
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,820
at query parameters too so now I've

362
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,740
taken this developers time and I'm said

363
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,360
okay I want you to go off and actually

364
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,070
go do a research particle method

365
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,500
override so I will tell you that this

366
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,200
particular developer is now in his team

367
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,300
the method override expert he knows all

368
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,040
about method override but I would think

369
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,660
that we shouldn't have had to have him

370
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,219
do all of that you were to help him

371
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:46,860
solve his problem so I think that our

372
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,390
language insecurity is a little bit out

373
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,100
of sync with what's going on in the

374
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:54,060
business and with our technology

375
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,110
partners so when we talk about sort of

376
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,329
who should be involved in this

377
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,339
conversation it's I think it's important

378
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,829
to understand how our language is coded

379
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,959
right insecure do we talk about things

380
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:06,529
like attack in defense and

381
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,589
vulnerabilities and findings and right

382
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:12,209
Sun Zoo and and take a hill listen I was

383
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:14,279
in the military I know all about that I

384
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:17,369
can I can do acronyms with the best of

385
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,990
them but we don't do anything unless we

386
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,420
like what we do in cyber security with

387
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,040
all of the the sort of fake militarism

388
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,569
that we like to apply to things right

389
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,140
we're talking about computers here you

390
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,630
know it's it's it's serious it can have

391
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,640
it can have real impacts but let's let's

392
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,000
let's keep some perspective here all

393
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,910
right

394
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,740
on the other hand within the product

395
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,230
space they're obviously concerned about

396
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,790
revenue so the language that that you

397
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,940
hear a lot and the way it's code is

398
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:47,189
around competition and cost of goods and

399
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,680
the total addressable market I won't

400
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,209
understand if I built this product how

401
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,400
many people is it going to apply to

402
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:54,869
who's the likely buyer when are they

403
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,350
going to be able to actually make a

404
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,360
buying

405
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,000
decision what happens if if there's a

406
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,580
problem I want to understand who my

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,860
competition is in terms of service as

408
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,350
well so if another company has a better

409
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,030
service offering in terms of like

410
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,320
support and things like that I want to

411
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,030
make sure I get that as well

412
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,950
pricing I want to make sure that my

413
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,870
pricing is is comparable to what the

414
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,610
market can stand obviously I'm also

415
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,440
interested in the funnel and when I say

416
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,140
the funnel I'm talking about the actual

417
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,520
buying process that goes from how do I

418
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,650
know that I have a prospective customer

419
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,150
all the way down to how do I know that I

420
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,300
have a customer that's going to be with

421
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,160
me for 20 years right and that all feeds

422
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,900
into my customer acquisition cost if

423
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,640
you're in a traditional sales

424
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,930
organization one of the things that

425
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,400
you're going to be very concerned about

426
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,469
is your customer acquisition cost

427
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,959
because you're gonna you're gonna spend

428
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,460
a lot of time trying to get a lead and

429
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,400
turning that lead into something and

430
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,510
that's going to be very very expensive

431
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,340
oftentimes product managers are also

432
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,110
concerned about risk as well but not

433
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,540
risking the way that we describe it it's

434
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,490
usually risk in terms of cost benefit

435
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,870
analysis and I know a lot of times in

436
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,310
security we sort of we sort of glaze

437
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,110
over because we're like that doesn't

438
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,540
have nothing to do with anything that I

439
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:06,030
care about I just want you to stop using

440
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,250
password one two three four five six but

441
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,310
when I put my product manager hat on I

442
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,470
have to be able to determine what

443
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,480
exactly I'm gonna have a developer go up

444
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,339
and do and what actual impact is gonna

445
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,470
have on my products and my ability to

446
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,939
get and retain more customers that's

447
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,920
what I care about and that's not

448
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,750
something that a lot of security folks

449
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,440
that I've talked to are interested in

450
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,940
hearing that said speaking of developers

451
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,580
the relationship between developers and

452
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,620
and product teams tends to be very close

453
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,240
and part of it's because they're using

454
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,250
similar language but part of its also to

455
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,050
that there's an understanding a clearer

456
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,420
standing of roles responsibilities on

457
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,280
the product side we obviously know that

458
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,830
folks are concerned about the problem

459
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,300
space on the engineering side they're

460
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,370
much more concerned about the solution

461
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,760
space right I don't really care

462
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,050
necessarily that the from the product

463
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,010
perspective I don't really care how you

464
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,480
solve the problem

465
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,570
but the engineers have to care about

466
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,830
that they have to care exactly they have

467
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,850
to care about things like technical debt

468
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,010
they have to care about things like

469
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,899
getting to market fast making sure that

470
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,670
the thing that they make can be serviced

471
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,059
and maintained and that it's resilient

472
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,919
and that it

473
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,570
fails over correctly they have to care

474
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,269
about things like churn we have

475
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,240
developers that that are that have okay

476
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:21,679
ours built a rap okay are being outcomes

477
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,299
kinky results objective humans all sorry

478
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,190
we have developers that have okay ours

479
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,289
and built around their ability to

480
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,740
actually push out quality code and get

481
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:33,450
PRS accepted so when we have this sort

482
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,649
of sideline relationship with security

483
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,740
that's not part of that conversation

484
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:39,989
that has a direct impact on developers

485
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,700
ability to actually deliver on those

486
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:46,529
okay ours and those key results so now

487
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,330
what does an ideal relationship look

488
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:50,159
like now I don't know if this is the

489
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,499
actual thing I don't this is the actual

490
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,499
Venn diagram of what it's going to look

491
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:57,629
like but you could see the case where we

492
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:59,190
want everybody to be basically speaking

493
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:01,350
the same language and that could be that

494
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,330
you know everyone in product also knows

495
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,529
everything about security everyone a

496
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,269
security knows everything about product

497
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,009
whatever that ends up being we need to

498
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:10,950
have folks at least having a basic

499
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:13,230
understanding of what it is we're trying

500
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,830
to achieve and what a win looks like for

501
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,149
each of our communities I think what we

502
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,668
need to be aiming for is much more of a

503
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:23,279
compromise for me I don't necessarily

504
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:25,679
need to see the P&L as a security

505
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,720
perspective that's a security person but

506
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,549
I probably want to know what your

507
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,679
revenue goals are around your products

508
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,658
because I also want to make sure that I

509
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,179
have enough security built in to protect

510
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:37,740
that revenue over the long haul and we

511
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,070
might say you know what does a firewall

512
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,779
have to do with building a product guess

513
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,249
what that product probably has to be

514
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,269
delivered through your firewall and your

515
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,009
customers are probably gonna have to

516
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:49,499
access that products through your

517
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:51,869
firewall so we want to make sure that

518
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:53,940
the firewall is appropriately tuned and

519
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:56,129
we're not using Bob's firewall from down

520
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,629
the way that you got from you know that

521
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,580
was that was a roll you know at four

522
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:01,110
o'clock in the morning we want to make

523
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,908
sure that we're looking at really really

524
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,279
really good quality stuff to protect

525
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:07,110
that revenue stream

526
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:09,840
similarly engineers probably don't care

527
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,309
about about the total addressable market

528
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,439
but they obviously want to make sure

529
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,450
that they are building a product that's

530
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,129
going to serve the most use cases and

531
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,750
cover the most customer the largest

532
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,918
customer base possible so that way

533
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,060
they're not going off and having to

534
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,420
rebuild and rebuild and rebuild and we

535
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,669
- right she just saw this one beginning

536
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:32,410
feel free to you know raise your hand

537
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:34,660
participate it's it's Saturday off this

538
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,100
is gonna be long long it's just me

539
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,370
talking um

540
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,560
so hot take time hot take time alright

541
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,830
so here's what I think the reason why I

542
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,530
called this hot takes is because frankly

543
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,120
you may violently disagree you may flip

544
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,480
a table if we may throw a chair

545
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,770
do not throw a chair at me mmm-hmm do

546
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,040
not throw a chair me I will throw it

547
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,629
back but this is what I believe to be

548
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,550
true I believe that if we're going to

549
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,520
secure the business we have to know the

550
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,379
business that means it's not just saying

551
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,810
and paying lip service to the fact that

552
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,370
oh yeah yeah we should we should

553
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,040
participate and work with our business

554
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,719
pals and and you know high-five and go

555
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,250
to the the picnic at the end of the year

556
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,020
now I mean we actually have to change

557
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,480
the way we talk to each other it means

558
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,389
we have to change what we know about how

559
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,920
the business works I also think that you

560
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,960
shouldn't need to be a security expert

561
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,610
to build a secure product that method

562
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,560
override story broke my heart

563
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,709
it really did because that developer

564
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,570
lost an entire day trying to unpack what

565
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,130
was frankly something that should have

566
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,520
been very simple and straightforward

567
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:42,010
now he's is he better for it because he

568
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,300
learned something sure yeah but when

569
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,520
we're talking about being measured by

570
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,159
how much code you can push and how and

571
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,460
how injured velocity we stole a day from

572
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,940
him and ultimately hurt him in in terms

573
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,190
of his his performance I also believe

574
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,600
that security solutions should be part

575
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,910
of the product is should contribute to

576
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,889
the success of the product big picture

577
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,590
if we're if we're just making security

578
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:08,760
things for security people then what in

579
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:11,470
the heck is the products board like

580
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,910
security is meant to be part of the the

581
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,400
overarching business and it's meant to

582
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,590
be part of what makes the part of the go

583
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,380
I think that when we talk about

584
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,379
measuring a success in security it

585
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,120
should also be thinking about how that

586
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,790
fits into the overall business and

587
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,510
success Jason Street in his keynote

588
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:33,879
today talked about how we have we have

589
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,129
to start you know providing the pie

590
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,010
charts and the num

591
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,110
and the and the spreadsheets to senior

592
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,450
leaders that's part of the story that we

593
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,300
need to tell absolutely and security

594
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,670
metrics are one of the ways that we can

595
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,389
move forward and helping product teams

596
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:57,170
build really good strong products all

597
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:59,910
right enough of the pontificating I

598
00:22:57,170 --> 00:24:19,920
think it's time to play a game hmm

599
00:22:59,910 --> 00:24:22,680
so yes sir yes sir yes right absolutely

600
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,420
so for those I didn't hear what he said

601
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,600
he was violently agreement agreeing with

602
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,600
me

603
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,710
all right thank you for your comment I

604
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,959
appreciate that so let's let's talk

605
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:39,110
about what this actually looks like I'm

606
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,820
gonna actually show you a little bit

607
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,219
about what what a developer might do I

608
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,110
ran an experiment over the past six

609
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,650
months actually it was a 2-day

610
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,899
experiment that I that has started to

611
00:24:48,650 --> 00:25:03,620
evolve in terms of how I work with the

612
00:24:50,900 --> 00:25:05,480
folks that at my day job but I want to

613
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,100
expose you to what that experiment

614
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,390
looked like so we're gonna play dungeon

615
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,580
master of engineering mmm okay here's a

616
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,820
scenario you're a full-stack developer

617
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,679
at a game retailer the business wants to

618
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,480
drive more interest in some of their

619
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,250
less popular games and believes that

620
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,760
they can do it by running a flash sale

621
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,290
on both web and mobile platforms

622
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,290
existing customers will get 10% off

623
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:32,180
while new customers would get 30% off so

624
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,250
truly distinguish the offer it will be

625
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,620
run as a pop-up sale helped almost

626
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,280
entirely separately from the main sales

627
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:42,439
funnel now I'm hoping that with your

628
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,660
security hats on your hands are sweating

629
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,610
because mine certainly was when I when I

630
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,730
was starting to type this cuz you know

631
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,409
it I would be lying if I told you that

632
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,760
they didn't happen in real life

633
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,450
it didn't happen at the place that I

634
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,070
work right now where we see that things

635
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,840
just sort of pop up they come from a

636
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:04,250
hackathon and all of a sudden they're in

637
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,209
production oh crap now what do we do

638
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,970
right

639
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,830
somebody had a great idea on the the

640
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,630
Thursday right before Cyber Monday and

641
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,050
now we have to get it out the door and

642
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,760
it has to be secure oh crap

643
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,680
so let's talk about what full that full

644
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,020
stack developer is so that we were all

645
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,270
in the same page and what we expect from

646
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,210
these folks when we when we actually go

647
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,310
through this scenario so an engineer a

648
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:32,990
full site developer and I love that the

649
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:34,909
pronunciation is full stack a full stack

650
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,760
developer is an engineer who can handle

651
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:40,040
all the work of databases servers system

652
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,990
engineering and clients depending on the

653
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,970
product depending on

654
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,400
what customers need maybe a mobile stack

655
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:51,590
a web stack or native application stack

656
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,570
now in security we we shredded out our

657
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,520
disciplines fairly fairly granularly

658
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,200
right we have folks that are security

659
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,170
experts in databases we have folks that

660
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,750
are security experts in IOT and in web

661
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,840
applications and all these things we are

662
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:11,210
expecting developers to do all of it in

663
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:13,459
mobile and web in native and IOT in push

664
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,890
messages they have to know how to get it

665
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:20,540
from github all the way out to the to

666
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:23,930
GCP and beyond so here's our flat sale

667
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,700
requirement full-stack developers we

668
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:27,410
want to build an app that covers both

669
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,350
the web and mobile we're going to focus

670
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:32,420
on a web for the sake of time our

671
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,459
customers should be able to log into an

672
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:38,540
existing account or register for a new

673
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,770
account via our our app we need to be

674
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,690
able to track the customer movements

675
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,340
around the site and we want to be able

676
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,770
to suggest to promote new games and

677
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,970
platforms on sister sites but we're only

678
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,590
going to use the existing payment

679
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,510
pattern so when they go to actually hit

680
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,790
checkout they're going to get punted

681
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:57,260
back to our original site mmm

682
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:59,450
oh and it has to be secure so in terms

683
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,030
of timing time is 8 a.m. Thursday

684
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:09,350
morning this has to be live by 5 a.m.

685
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:11,870
Monday morning yes everybody's working

686
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,340
overtime but for the sake of this

687
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,629
experiment I want you to pretend for a

688
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,350
second you don't know all that you know

689
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,970
about security right we're gonna pick a

690
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,370
technology that is fairly easy to get

691
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,470
into we're going to use JavaScript and

692
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,320
it just so happens that JavaScript is is

693
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,390
quite ubiquitous in the web world and

694
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,560
we're gonna confront security questions

695
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,380
as they come up because that's basically

696
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,270
what developers have to do that's what's

697
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,500
happening for real we may say we won't

698
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,600
you got a design is secure from the

699
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,060
beginning what's happening in reality is

700
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,260
that folks are saying oh crap I've got

701
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,120
to figure out how long the password

702
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,530
should be this is already live I have

703
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,850
people they've already put three

704
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,690
character passwords out there already

705
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,520
crap and the application itself has to

706
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,990
be secure it can't be an add-on it can't

707
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,010
be some blinky bots and youth that you

708
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:00,020
throw on

709
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:03,860
that's the experiment okay so we're

710
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:10,190
gonna build this together right now now

711
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:16,820
I have put together I have put together

712
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:19,880
a quick little note app that hopefully

713
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,220
won't break on me all right so here's

714
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,530
our flash sale site it's a quick little

715
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,230
note app these are the games that we're

716
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,840
going to sell it's a very skeleton

717
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,270
skeleton site basically none of the

718
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,419
backend works but I want you to take a

719
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:37,040
look at this and from the front from the

720
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,250
perspective of the developer I'm ready

721
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,680
to go I'm ready to hit Send and now here

722
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:47,480
comes some of them security saying oh

723
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:50,390
hey what what what what is this what are

724
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,340
you doing here so throw out some

725
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:58,240
questions what are you concerned about

726
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:58,240
immediately security people yes sir

727
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:28,070
mm-hmm so you're gonna turn about the

728
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:32,510
database okay others well what input

729
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:38,560
validation okay what else for the record

730
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:38,560
and none of that's in here what else

731
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,080
cookies what about the cookies

732
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,040
okay so I'll tell you that this app this

733
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,190
is me if my dungeon master had on this

734
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,129
app has been built on top of firebase

735
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:02,330
firebase is controlling the the it's

736
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,630
running the underlying authentication

737
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:08,210
service with what it's not doing it's

738
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,540
not doing any input validation it's not

739
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,690
do

740
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,220
any database validation so it's the the

741
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,730
data that might go in there is not

742
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:19,030
pristine in terms of cookies and

743
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:23,480
sessions I haven't set any flags

744
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:25,820
whatsoever and in terms of the password

745
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,920
length it enforces a six character

746
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:34,780
password now what else are you concerned

747
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:41,930
about anything sequel injection okay

748
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:44,570
what else all right so I'm gonna I'm

749
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,670
gonna if those are the things that that

750
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,679
we are concerned about I'll tell you

751
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:55,760
what everyone else is gonna do they're

752
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:58,760
gonna google it right so I typed in like

753
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,160
what many developers have done no js'

754
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,260
security for authentication and here's

755
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,330
the first thing that pops up you're no

756
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,890
js' authentication tutorial is probably

757
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:11,389
wrong alright sweet awesome amazing so

758
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,910
basically what do I trust if the thing

759
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,440
that I'm looking at is is wrong all

760
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,110
right well how about learn how to handle

761
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,110
authentication with password passport

762
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:23,000
j/s all right sweet but it looks like

763
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:27,469
and hopefully my Wi-Fi works in here it

764
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,600
might not it looks like I'll just tell

765
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,280
you what it was there we go

766
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,100
one of the things that this thing

767
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,870
recommended that you turn on Jason web

768
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,490
tokens it doesn't tell you what to put

769
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,860
in the web tokens had invalid the web

770
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,500
tokens how to store the web tokens where

771
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,939
the web token what you go in there who

772
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,350
should get access to them what the role

773
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,150
should be those are the things that

774
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,879
started making my hand sweat when I

775
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:51,350
start seeing these tutorials so you know

776
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,820
what's not showing up in here when I

777
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,449
talk about password and security

778
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,860
authentication was-- that's that's the

779
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,480
one thing that we tell everybody to go

780
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,219
look at when they talk about you know

781
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,480
web application security oh wasps

782
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:08,150
doesn't show up really not even on top 5

783
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,680
so when we talk about why our developers

784
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,970
doing what they're doing and why and why

785
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,480
are we seeing the same issues that we're

786
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:17,090
seeing what we find is that we have a

787
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,750
bunch of tutorials out there that are

788
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:22,129
contradictory that may not necessarily

789
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:26,080
say the right thing that are flat

790
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:28,940
out wrong and oh by the way that the

791
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,530
guidance that is given doesn't overlap

792
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,810
really at all with the existing security

793
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:34,970
guidance that's out there from sources

794
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:38,080
that we in security trust like a wasp

795
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,080
like NIST

796
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:45,710
alright so I ran this experiment myself

797
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:49,879
I put together a quick little app just

798
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:51,950
like I showed you and one of the things

799
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,630
that that I had to really think through

800
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,560
is what trade-offs was I going to make

801
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:59,090
in terms of security so here's what I

802
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,100
ended up with this was my security

803
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,260
coverage map I was turned about login

804
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,530
and registration concerned about profile

805
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:11,210
management session management my api's

806
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:14,570
as well as delivery so when I went and I

807
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:18,139
looked for those specific things in on

808
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:20,120
Google for nodejs applications these

809
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,040
were my primary sources now these

810
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,589
numbers you're seeing here on the far

811
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,449
right is what the actual coverage is

812
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:29,240
with sources that we would trust in

813
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:31,310
security so this 25 percent is the

814
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,949
high-water mark of coverage between a

815
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:37,070
wasp so what I'm saying here is that of

816
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:39,290
all of the COAS recommendations there

817
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,530
was 25 percent coverage of those

818
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:45,020
recommendations in this source

819
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:47,510
similarly in in the profile management

820
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:51,139
one there was absolutely no coverage

821
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,639
meaning that wasps didn't then they'd

822
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,560
have a recommendation or the

823
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,290
recommendation wasn't covered at all in

824
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,630
this tutorial furthermore as we get down

825
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:02,180
the road you can see that Korres was

826
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,150
pretty good Oh Oz said everything that

827
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,970
my course a tutorial also said horse

828
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,080
being cross-origin resource sharing so

829
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,049
that was really really neat I

830
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,330
appreciated that and I trusted that but

831
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:17,060
I couldn't trust any of my other sources

832
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,200
so how do I know that what I built is

833
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,500
actually secure

834
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,359
that's what developers are asking this

835
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,600
wasn't easy it was not an easy exercise

836
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,030
I gave myself 48 hours to do exactly

837
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,390
what I asked you to do in in five

838
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,620
minutes my biggest concern was figuring

839
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,150
out whether or not I could trust my

840
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,839
sources and whether or not I had

841
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,840
implemented

842
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,150
my guidance sufficiently the other

843
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,430
pieces I saw was that very first link

844
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,840
that you saw what if what if it's wrong

845
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,060
how do I know if it's wrong how do I

846
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,410
know if I can trust it the other piece

847
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,690
that I had to deal with is the fact that

848
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,230
security is a spectrum and we know that

849
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:57,260
I think we inherently know that that

850
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,550
frankly an app is only as secure as the

851
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,690
time of day that you're looking at it in

852
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,720
who's looking at and who's asking

853
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:05,170
questions right I was making trade-offs

854
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,310
about about the apps performance

855
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,800
specifically because I needed to get it

856
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,090
out the door quickly and security was

857
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,460
one of the first things that I had to

858
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:16,160
make trade-offs about I was okay with

859
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,600
the six character password so long as as

860
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,440
long as it was hashed correctly in the

861
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:24,850
database I was okay with with making

862
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,790
sure that my session cookies were were

863
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:31,100
were being transmitted over HTTP but I

864
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,410
also had to make a trade-off in terms of

865
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,790
the the length of the session that was

866
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:40,279
those are the things that I was looking

867
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:42,800
at so in general one of the things that

868
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,500
I found after doing this experiment is

869
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,020
that the way that I communicate with

870
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,090
developers and my technology partners

871
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,880
has changed 100% this was a

872
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,620
transformative exercise for me to do and

873
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,110
I would say that if you're struggling

874
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,210
with feeling like you can't really you

875
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,940
know that the people aren't getting it I

876
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,740
would say try something like this you

877
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,260
don't have to code you don't have to go

878
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:09,350
off and and and build a thing like I

879
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:12,440
built but go write a story go write a

880
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,970
scenario and and maybe take someone a

881
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,130
lunch and say hey how did we work

882
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,779
through this to make it secure right for

883
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,550
me it worked out really well because I

884
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,290
was able to start talking to developers

885
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,600
and language and in terms that they

886
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:27,230
understand that resonate with them so I

887
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:29,810
talk to them more often and what we talk

888
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,270
about is of higher quality because of

889
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:34,850
that we've been able to actually create

890
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:37,190
I think a relationship a really trust

891
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,130
trust built relationship so that way

892
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,660
when I tell them that something is

893
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,400
really really bad and we need to fix it

894
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,170
and not do that and probably we need to

895
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,170
make sure that that we have a way to

896
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,770
check on whether or not someone is

897
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,990
modifying the controls

898
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:53,430
they trust me when I say it and when

899
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,839
it's a high finding it too high finding

900
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,580
they also know that I'm not gonna

901
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,779
 them and bring them garbage so

902
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,520
across the board the findings closure

903
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,940
rate that of the ones of the parts that

904
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:12,450
I consult on has certainly improved all

905
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:14,609
right so recommendations I've already

906
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:17,009
said this I think that we all sort of

907
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:18,500
inherently know it but to secure the

908
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,300
business you have to know the business

909
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,940
and I think inherently it comes down to

910
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,290
three things protect the customer and I

911
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,640
will tell you I say that the bigger at

912
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:32,700
the beginning target is is learned it's

913
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,049
lesson like a thousand fold with every

914
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,089
conversation that we have with

915
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,460
developers with product managers with

916
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:40,170
with business analysts our very first

917
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,800
question is how is this going to impact

918
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:46,010
our guests so our first priority is to

919
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,630
affect it so it's a protect not affect

920
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,580
protects the customer to the greatest

921
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,680
extent possible and that really if

922
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,450
you're getting pushed back from from

923
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,609
folks that you work with development

924
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,310
teams that's that's where I start with

925
00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:02,160
is is this gonna hurt our customer in

926
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,599
any way if it's not then let's talk

927
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,180
about how we can do what you want to do

928
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,640
in a way that's going to be safe our

929
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,649
next priority is to protect the roadmap

930
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,569
and what I mean by that is that I'd like

931
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,670
to see us and security start getting

932
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:16,920
more creative about how we can

933
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,869
contribute to the success of the product

934
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,530
and not just come in after the fact and

935
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:24,810
and throw on bolt-on things and and hope

936
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,190
that you know eventually a product

937
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,230
manager will care about it enough to

938
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,940
actually make it happen that doesn't

939
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,650
work that way as a product manager I'm

940
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,420
telling you I'm working on things that

941
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,599
are growing my customer base I'm not

942
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:42,380
necessarily have security front of mine

943
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,380
yes ma'am yep

944
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:38,410
yeah yeah yeah

945
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,000
it starts with asking questions even if

946
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,220
you think it's a silly question

947
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,470
ask ask a question because what I find a

948
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,899
lot of times is that somebody's made a

949
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,029
decision and in some room and some

950
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,849
meeting someplace and that may be that

951
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:54,369
or maybe sitting in somebody's email

952
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:56,259
somewhere and it's never made it out to

953
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,059
the larger audience that actually has to

954
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:59,799
enforce it that actually has to deal

955
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:02,259
with the the consequences from it and

956
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:04,599
actually has to understand what happens

957
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,549
with that data and how we destroy it how

958
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,319
we handle it all those things but it

959
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,329
starts with saying hey you're the

960
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,069
product manager on this product can you

961
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:15,880
tell me what your what your philosophy

962
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:18,460
is on on security and hey this is the

963
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,720
security person on this product what's

964
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,700
what decisions have been made what's

965
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,669
coming up and how can we make sure that

966
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,529
our customers are looking at security in

967
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,569
a way that's intuitive and native and

968
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:29,920
that it's not painful to them right

969
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,390
especially as we talk about things like

970
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,579
design and I'd be happy to talk with you

971
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,319
more about this and offline but you talk

972
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:36,279
about things like design we have to

973
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:38,349
figure out a way to make it intuitive

974
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:41,049
and native so being able to you can be

975
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:42,579
that bridge between your product owner

976
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:44,619
and your security person if it doesn't

977
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:46,450
seem like they're talking right that's

978
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:50,400
that's that's where that's where you can

979
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:50,399
actually be that relationship builder

980
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:16,489
mm-hmm yeah so so I would say one of the

981
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,229
things that I always have to make sure

982
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:21,019
that I understand and I reconcile is

983
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:22,879
that not everybody knows what I know as

984
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:26,598
a security person so the thing that's

985
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,269
obvious to me it to go do into and to go

986
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,099
turn on or turn off or not not flip that

987
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:33,468
button sometimes it's about saying the

988
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:34,999
thing that you think is obvious in front

989
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,959
of in front of everybody and even if

990
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:39,529
they roll their eyes no like oh yeah

991
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:41,538
okay Susan Thanks all right like say it

992
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:43,999
out loud and make sure everyone goes yes

993
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:46,369
we got it because eventually someone's

994
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:48,439
gonna be wait what why wait we did that

995
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:50,029
that was the plan what happens with that

996
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,589
part of it is just getting the

997
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:53,089
conversation going and saying hey this

998
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:55,519
is what I think is gonna make the best

999
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:57,078
user experience in order to not just

1000
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,729
protect our guests and not just protect

1001
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:01,549
our customers but also to grow our

1002
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:03,200
business right if you're in a company

1003
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:06,259
you're a stakeholder in that company you

1004
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,479
are and and you know I don't know where

1005
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:14,059
you work but I assume that you want to

1006
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:15,890
do a good job okay okay yeah so you

1007
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:18,109
wanna do a good job and so I they pay

1008
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:20,118
you for your opinion they pay all of us

1009
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:21,890
for our opinions so when you stand up

1010
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,170
and say whatever it is that we're about

1011
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,239
to do let's make sure that it's it's

1012
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,910
helping everybody and it's protecting

1013
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,469
our customers right that should not fall

1014
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,029
on deaf ears and if it does and there's

1015
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:34,579
there's something else going on there

1016
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:37,630
between security as well as as well as a

1017
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:37,630
product yes ma'am

1018
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:20,630
yeah thank you all right

1019
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,759
the last little bit I always protect the

1020
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,710
pipeline I will tell you that this is

1021
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,230
the part that I still find challenging

1022
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,420
today when I say protect the pipeline

1023
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,760
I'm talking about anything that touches

1024
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,610
the products generation process

1025
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,030
including design including developers

1026
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:40,190
including the supply chain including the

1027
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:43,160
laptops that you're working on including

1028
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:46,460
the GCP including fastly in your pops

1029
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,799
and your CD and everything that has that

1030
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,500
touches the process of building product

1031
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,170
from your business analyst to developer

1032
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:58,310
all the way out to the actual customer

1033
00:44:54,170 --> 00:45:01,520
that is that is that is using it they're

1034
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:03,730
part of the pipeline and what I tell my

1035
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,080
developers when I work with them is that

1036
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,820
build as much pipeline as you can afford

1037
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,940
to protect because that's what I'm gonna

1038
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,830
go look at that's what I when you tell

1039
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,690
me is it secure I'm gonna ask you how

1040
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:16,850
big is the pipeline and where is it that

1041
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,380
the data is coming from and how are we

1042
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:20,029
destroying that data how are we handling

1043
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,740
that data and how are we making sure

1044
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:24,110
that the right folks have access to that

1045
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,479
data only but as much pipeline as you

1046
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,040
can afford to protect the other piece of

1047
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,280
is that I find that and this is a

1048
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,380
security ISM is that we use the word

1049
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,480
just a lot just don't collect that data

1050
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,720
just turn that off just run this

1051
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,390
firewall rule that that that's that's

1052
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,399
not possible yeah I mean it I don't like

1053
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,279
to say the word never but when we use

1054
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:49,240
that word just what it does is that it

1055
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:53,660
alienates us further from from our

1056
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:58,759
technology and product team as well as

1057
00:45:53,660 --> 00:46:00,410
it minimizes it and sort of marginalizes

1058
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,820
the decisions that have been made from

1059
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:04,790
people that maybe didn't have all the

1060
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:08,450
information so when we say just turn off

1061
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:11,090
this thing just just have a 18 character

1062
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,250
password yeah we can say that but that

1063
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:15,080
someone has to go do that work and we

1064
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,610
can't minimize what that takes to do

1065
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:20,270
that

1066
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:24,070
all right so please assume that I'm also

1067
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:27,020
including UX in this conversation okay

1068
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:27,840
in terms of working with developers what

1069
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,270
I have found most

1070
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:36,080
that's what has helped me the most is

1071
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:40,259
avoiding the oogie-boogie dance dances

1072
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,910
Jason's partly doing it yeah okie-dokie

1073
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,980
dance is where you come and you make

1074
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,960
 up right in order to get somebody

1075
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,760
to do what you want the work there's a

1076
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,890
hacker he's gonna come and he's good

1077
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,810
he's good he's got a hoodie he's gonna

1078
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,490
step to your computer right that's the

1079
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,720
Oogie Boogie dance and I find that if

1080
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:57,390
you want to build credibility you have

1081
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,250
to talk about what's real and this is

1082
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,810
about building credibility and building

1083
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,790
relationships and building and making

1084
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:05,220
sure that people can trust you when you

1085
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:07,830
actually are saying that this is a

1086
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,930
problem right so avoid the oogie-boogie

1087
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:13,529
dance and talk about what matters to the

1088
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:15,509
product your your burp scanners and your

1089
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:18,690
zap proxies and all these things are

1090
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:20,490
gonna spit out a lot of scary things and

1091
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,320
say oh my god it's a critical finding oh

1092
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,720
holy drop everything to the

1093
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:29,480
five-alarm fire right and I'm sorry if

1094
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,890
I'm cursing it's Saturday but hmm

1095
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,020
remember that your tools don't have your

1096
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,430
context your tools don't know that you

1097
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,009
have a Web Application Firewall turned

1098
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:39,390
on they don't know that you have that

1099
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,310
you have antivirus they don't well they

1100
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,080
don't know that there's all these other

1101
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:45,779
things that might be in places so when

1102
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,759
you see that high finding before you go

1103
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,700
and run off and say hey you need to go

1104
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,340
drop this and fix it please keep that in

1105
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,259
keep in mind that it is in context with

1106
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:57,720
the entirety of your platform and of

1107
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,260
your ecosystem before you start

1108
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:06,259
characterizing risk in terms of working

1109
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:06,260
with business partners I would say

1110
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,740
designers out there because they're

1111
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,870
gonna decide what goes on the roadmap

1112
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,609
ultimately and we have to be able to

1113
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:17,910
define risk in terms of what matters to

1114
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:20,370
them all right so if you are interested

1115
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,899
in learning more and just getting just

1116
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,549
leveling up your skills and starting

1117
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,560
just you know build build a dictionary

1118
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:28,230
in a lexicon there's a couple of udemy

1119
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,200
courses I'd recommend one of them is

1120
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,160
specifically basically business 101

1121
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,419
where they talk about things like cost

1122
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,859
of goods they talk about things like

1123
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,140
customer acquisition and those things

1124
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,090
and they also there's another course if

1125
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,480
you're you know not so much on the on

1126
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,310
the product side

1127
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,500
on the engineering side but you want to

1128
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:49,480
be able talk about things like stories

1129
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:51,820
and requirements and themes and epics

1130
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,470
being able to talk the language of how

1131
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:58,810
product is built is also going to be

1132
00:48:53,470 --> 00:49:01,959
really helpful okay we got a couple

1133
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:04,690
minutes left if you want to reach out to

1134
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,859

anywhere but this has been really fun I

1138
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:16,529
enjoyed myself if there's any questions

1139
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:22,540
I'd be happy to take them on yes now

on speaker deck and I'll send a link to

1142
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:55,480
the new account books okay yes sir well

1143
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:57,760
yeah I think one way that you could do

1144
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,170
that so what I find is just honestly

1145
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,180
being in the room and you know this to

1146
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,109
me from from what what you work on all

1147
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,450
the time right

1148
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:06,790
sometimes just showing up gives you that

1149
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:08,290
level of credibility right you can't

1150
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,550
always walk in and be like oh hey I'm

1151
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,529
gonna be part of your scrum team now

1152
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:14,859
tell me all the things give me a story

1153
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:17,410
to work on but I will tell you the folks

1154
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:18,910
that I work with I started showing up

1155
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,230
and sitting in the in the break room and

1156
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,629
they finally turned and said hey what

1157
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,910
are you doing here

1158
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:26,170
and I was like oh I'm just listening in

1159
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,149
and hearing hearing what stories you're

1160
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,349
telling and I'm your security person if

1161
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,050
you have any questions I'd be happy to

1162
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:33,250
help out right and it's that evolved and

1163
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,599
evolved and they were like you know you

1164
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,859
don't have to sit in the break room we

1165
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:37,720
can get you a seat and now they've

1166
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:39,339
gotten you a permanent seat right and

1167
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,009
it's one of those things where for me I

1168
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:44,410
wear that as a badge of honor because

1169
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:45,640
you know when I would show up before it

1170
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:47,319
would be like Oh

1171
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,210
Security's here we're in trouble

1172
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:52,119
Security's here something we screwed up

1173
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:54,190
oh man right the other piece of it is is

1174
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:56,380
getting management buy-in so even your

1175
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:58,240
initial management's to say hey I like

1176
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,920
to go shadow the folks over in the

1177
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,899
business analyst world for a week or so

1178
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,609
right if you can make a good case for it

1179
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,400
you can identify how that's gonna

1180
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:07,538
ultimately make security better I think

1181
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:26,980
you have a really good chance of making

1182
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:28,390
that happen yes ma'am oh yeah yeah and

1183
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,950
at Target

1184
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:34,240
one of the things that we do is we have

1185
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:37,480
so security is built into has an okay

1186
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,950
are for our digital team so we have

1187
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,470
everybody that has to have what we call

1188
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:44,410
a product intelligence score above 700

1189
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:47,259
700 out of 850 and what that really

1190
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:50,618
measures is are we turning findings

1191
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,030
around on time are we seeing like things

1192
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:55,150
like cross side scripting are we seeing

1193
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:57,420
things like sqli are we seeing that that

1194
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:59,920
we have people that are competing there

1195
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,390
awareness training and that we're

1196
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,809
cutting down on fishing and things like

1197
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:05,980
that so being able to gamify it as jason

1198
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:12,900
said is it's another way that we could

1199
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:12,900
do it - yeah yes ma'am yeah

1200
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:58,250
yeah right right yeah one of the big

1201
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,230
things that you'll find in engineering

1202
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,240
and there's an article from IBM that was

1203
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:04,250
that was in about ten years ago about

1204
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,379
the idea of prevention versus cure right

1205
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:09,500
it costs more to fix something in

1206
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:13,690
production versus when it's when it's

1207
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,690
still on the developers laptop right

1208
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:21,770
right mm-hmm

1209
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,450
so yeah I'm happy to talk with you

1210
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:26,330
offline I do think that one of the

1211
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,830
things that that an action that you can

1212
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:30,020
immediately take is really in how you

1213
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,250
couch and how you phrase it right if it

1214
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,359
sounds like hey I need you to give me

1215
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,990
some money just in case something

1216
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,670
happens

1217
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,430
that's good that's probably not gonna go

1218
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:40,460
the way we want it to go right but being

1219
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:42,410
able to say hey your revenue goal is 10

1220
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,670

1224
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:55,880
