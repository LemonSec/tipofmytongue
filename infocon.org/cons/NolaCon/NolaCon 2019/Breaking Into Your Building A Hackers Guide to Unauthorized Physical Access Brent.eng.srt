1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,010
hello everyone welcome to breaking into

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,980
your building a hackers guide of

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,428
unauthorized access I'm your host Tim

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,570
Roberts I'm Brent white so who are these

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,400
guys again

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,590
we are pen testers senior security

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,198
consultants for inch D security and we

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,509
specialize in physical intrusion

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,109
physical side assessment thing things

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,449
like that so our whole thing is sort of

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,270
what Jason does with trying to gain

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,950
access to buildings but we also like to

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,340
bring some cool tools along with us as

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,960
well so we aren't as cool as Jason I

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,059
suppose because we require tools so yeah

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,950
so though we have people calm that's our

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,910
personal blog you can go there as some

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,399
of the things we'll talk about today

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,788
bypass methods things like that you can

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,140
see some of that information as well

21
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,149
something we just would like to always

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,910
say in our talks is not all hackers are

23
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,690
bad you know the term hacker is a little

24
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,220
subjective but we like to think of you

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,259
know we're all hackers right as long as

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,289
we can make something do something that

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,229
it wasn't intended to do you know for

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,000
our benefit I guess yeah and so the

29
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,210
media again I always ask this question

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,590
does anybody in here wear a ski mask and

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,169
gloves when you're working at your

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,720
computer hacking away no you don't put

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,860
your name right maybe you do if you're

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,600
the first person that's ever raise your

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,590
hand so yeah I mean you see all these

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,479
stupid images I mean what is this

37
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,950
yeah just Google hacker and these are

38
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,509
the things you come up with right yeah

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,939
just look in the image search this

40
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,860
ridiculous stuff and there's this image

41
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,869
to of like you know hear the word hacker

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,369
they think that you're going to rob them

43
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,079
in the parking lot and still their baby

44
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:52,500
or something you know it's like hey

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:54,570
we're people too so we're we're very

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,490
mature you'll see that in our slides and

47
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,398
things as we go and something else too

48
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,079
anybody that has questions just raise

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,600
your hand we'll answer those as we go we

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,189
don't have to wait until the end so yeah

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,878
or if you want to heckle that's cool too

52
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,880
so just really quick just unauthorized

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,859
this want to clarify that

54
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,590
this is when we are taking on the

55
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,320
security posture or taking on the role

56
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,600
of an attacker potential attacker

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,950
we don't just roll up somewhere and try

58
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,680
to break into a building because that's

59
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,619
illegal we have permission from that

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,800
client first obviously so that is what

61
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,480
we mean when we say unauthorized so

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
Brett was saying some of the things that

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
we do after we've established our rules

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,240
of engagement and the scope of the

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,650
assessment what's the goal where are we

66
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,390
trying to get into are we trying to get

67
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,490
into an executive suite into a data

68
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,320
center are we trying to steal a server

69
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,230
out of the room and you know things are

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,420
discussed during the kickoff call but

71
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,399
mostly what Brett and I focus on these

72
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,470
days are covert physical security

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,950
assessments what this means as we go in

74
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,540
try to covertly sneak into your building

75
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,179
and while we're in there we test your

76
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,799
physical security controls too so we

77
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,900
usually add social engineering in there

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,190
but it also it's very dynamic and it

79
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,610
depends on what the client is looking

80
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:13,760
for in kind of a situation from what we

81
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,350
choose to do right sometimes we do need

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,590
to interact with people and other times

83
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,299
we do what we can without you know being

84
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,730
noticed we try to stay as gray as

85
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,170
possible so I'm gonna talk about

86
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,609
surveillance you know there's so many

87
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,739
tools out there just wanted to show us

88
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,980
some of these really cheap things that

89
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,740
you can get like the spy cam pin or even

90
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:38,179
a cheap little lighter with a camera

91
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,670
inside of it I mean this stuff if you're

92
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,080
going to use things like this change the

93
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,420
housing of it because there are people

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,280
that are trained to spot these things so

95
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,660
if you just roll in there with you know

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,010
one of these spy pens or something

97
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,859
they're going to say oh that's not a

98
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,840
real ink pen come with me so be creative

99
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,080
with these things if you do need to

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,610
started working into more like artful

101
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,100
concealment with some of these tools

102
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,600
there are a lot of other resources and

103
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,220
we're happy to talk to you about that as

104
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,989
well this is something to I want to add

105
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,460
a little disclaimer whenever you do the

106
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,990
rules of engagement you're talking to

107
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,310
the clients make sure that you have

108
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,690
authorization to do any kind of

109
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,070
recording because some of our

110
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,840
assessments will record while we're on

111
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,579
site some of them you know of course we

112
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,079
take pictures of evidence and such but

113
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,870
you need to make sure that that's clear

114
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
cuz there are certain laws and stuff you

115
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,550
got a week

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,560
client was so addition to the

117
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,389
surveillance some of the things we do we

118
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,380
just we like the Matic pro just because

119
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:34,880
it's fun but we just put like a Wi-Fi

120
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,009
like a nano on the top you know that's

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,360
really simple and it was a quick thing

122
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,639
to do we got some industrial-strength

123
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,340
velcro tape taped it on there and didn't

124
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,680
it could still fly yeah really well a

125
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,138
lot of advanced engineering went into

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,509
that setup yes very much so very highly

127
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,449
technical we put some gaffers tape to

128
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:54,620
keep the antennas from flopping around

129
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,729
but one of the things we do is we'll

130
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,199
just fly it over there and land on the

131
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,690
building you know there are ways to

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,270
prevent this there are Faraday things

133
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,280
you can put on top of your roof damage

134
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,620
signal jammers and such but this is an

135
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,690
easy way to just go and put it up an

136
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,810
evil ap or sniff something or if you

137
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,849
want to put even a RFID Kohner you can

138
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,780
get close enough or something but the

139
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:19,219
noise of these things is too loud to fly

140
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,859
around people yeah it's it's definitely

141
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,419
not something you want to do as your

142
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,680
first step nearing reconnaissance

143
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,169
because you're going to call attention

144
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,580
that something is going on truthfully

145
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,599
the only time we ever use a drone is

146
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,800
just at night when we do some

147
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,900
reconnaissance just to see where the

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,389
access points are and like outside the

149
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,469
entry points and the roof to get a good

150
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,449
look at the roof just do a physical

151
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,830
assessment of that without climbing up

152
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:44,630
there yeah so if if the certain location

153
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,740
if it's hard to see you know with

154
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,169
cameras if it's hard to get good

155
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,039
photographs of what the access controls

156
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,630
are from on the door or we're there

157
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,820
through our guard stations are things

158
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,680
like that and maybe the the images on

159
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,110
Google Maps I've have been sanitized in

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,580
a way that they aren't helpful then

161
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,300
that's when we might you know throw the

162
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:08,990
drone up there so so what is Tim and bit

163
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:12,620
or are Tim and Britt doing up here that

164
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:15,710
is a plane yeah software-defined radio

165
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,479
it's awesome it's useful for places

166
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,270
where you might go where you can perhaps

167
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,340
snoop on security teams if they are

168
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,250
using unencrypted radios there are also

169
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,419
ways to decrypt those signals as well in

170
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,330
order just want to listen to the radio

171
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,190
yeah yeah one night when I was playing

172
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,289
around learning to use this it's kind of

173
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,270
embarrassing in funny stores in Dallas I

174
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,909
was laying in my hotel

175
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,229
so about bed and I started hearing

176
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,090
something and it was this lady and she

177
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,680
was like these diamonds are amazing you

178
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,210
have to buy these diamonds because

179
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,300
they're not going to be around for long

180
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,758
it was like awesome what is this so I

181
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:54,259
start tuning it in even more and it

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,750
ended up just being a QVC broadcast and

183
00:06:54,259 --> 00:07:00,830
so close so yeah

184
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,349
I'm still learning SDR again going under

185
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,849
surveillance you can use these things

186
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,560
there's a lot of good places that you

187
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:09,830
can use them but if you're going into

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,539
more higher security areas again change

189
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,400
the housing there are some really really

190
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:18,169
good versions of these things but just

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,479
that the cheapo off-the-shelf things

192
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,159
they can work but you can also burn

193
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,400
yourself pretty I bought this leg it was

194
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:27,139
like a 1080p it's called cop cam it was

195
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,090
like a little little square it looked

196
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,120
like a miniature visit one of the

197
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,429
fidgets boxes or whatever battery had a

198
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,930
micro SD on it and I mean it works great

199
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,250
it's just a little tiny square you can

200
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,389
just kind of carry around and put

201
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,849
wherever he wants it yep

202
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,990
so just real quick we're kind of go

203
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,310
through some of this stuff really quick

204
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,469
because we have a lot of content but

205
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,789
there are some cases where if you're

206
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:48,169
doing certain reconnaissance

207
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,150
surveillance you don't necessarily want

208
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,448
to burn yourself especially if it's a

209
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,789
smaller team and they are you know they

210
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:58,639
they actually are pretty legitimate with

211
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,159
their with their coverage for security

212
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,110
cameras things like that there might be

213
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,280
some cases where you need to change your

214
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,409
appearance just for some quick

215
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,080
surveillance yeah we don't do a whole

216
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,280
lot of this because we just kind of

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,020
depending on whatever guys we come up

218
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,960
with if we want to be a contractor or a

219
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,340
vendor maintenance worker you know Evan

220
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,919
ease and screws and go sit right there

221
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,780
yeah Oh Joe Dirt you know with that we

222
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,818
do a lot of we do a lot of acting too

223
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,679
outside of this so the improv exercises

224
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:28,099
and things help you to blend in in a

225
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,219
quick sidenote the picture of me as a

226
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,450
land surveyor you can set that up as

227
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,000
long as you have like a high-vis vest

228
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,560
and something and something people will

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,349
not pay attention to you in most areas

230
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,228
so you can even have that in that tripod

231
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:45,199
and have a huge camera lens on there

232
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,630
that is obviously not land surveying

233
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,109
equipment at all taking photographs of

234
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,870
things but

235
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,810
because you are positioning yourself in

236
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,190
a certain area with a certain look

237
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,890
people like you're basically invisible

238
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,360
so and then blending into like this just

239
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,040
reminded me of it but carrying around

240
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,600
the ladder I mean you guys see people do

241
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,459
this online a lot they just carry a

242
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,220
stepladder but one of the guys on our

243
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,689
team I was the project manager and so I

244
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,760
had a knife ache number on there we

245
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,950
found out who the the property manager

246
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,170
was for this building that the client

247
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,850
was renting from I wrote up a fake

248
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,529
letter saying that we need to you know

249
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,240
inspection because there was a recall on

250
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:23,360
the sprinkler head model blah blah blah

251
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,700
and then I gave them this letter and he

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,870
pretended to be with the property

253
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,149
manager and he was able to just walk

254
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,320
around in with a stepladder and when

255
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,269
they asked him they looked at the letter

256
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,370
and they called me and everything was

257
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,930
fine and he installed a rogue access

258
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,800
point and they're sitting in the

259
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,329
conference room with his ladder so so

260
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,829
just quick on this I was doing an

261
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,989
assessment a physical assessment against

262
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:46,370
the hospital was my first time at the

263
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,100
hospital wasn't really sure what to

264
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,800
expect and the longer I was there which

265
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:55,070
was quite a few hours learned that

266
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,170
different different roles have different

267
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,990
color scrubs so like sanitation crew for

268
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,550
example would wear the maroon scrubs so

269
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,949
I didn't have any and it have any scrubs

270
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,290
with me but after walking around the

271
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:08,180
gift shop at the hospital had every type

272
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,910
of scrub for sale this is this is

273
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,560
actually from that place so one of them

274
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,120
one of the best ones to use too is the

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,979
black because the phlebotomist use the

276
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,019
black scrubs and they come and go and

277
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,339
there's such a turnover from these guys

278
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,500
because there's several of them taking

279
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,410
blood from different locations and stuff

280
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,360
so yeah that's pretty handy yeah and

281
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,490
again if you're trying to blend in

282
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,980
having that gigantic lens trying to hide

283
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,620
it with something like that nope

284
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,930
you know just just use use common sense

285
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,420
now if you're somewhere and it makes

286
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,640
sense to say you're your back story

287
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,339
would be taking pictures of a sporting

288
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,649
event or national landmarks or something

289
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,480
like that and your yeah make yourself

290
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,399
look more like a tourist than some shady

291
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,850
dude trying to you know act like he's

292
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,380
not doing something so so there's just a

293
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,209
couple of the things that we carry

294
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,250
around in our bags but not all the time

295
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,920
do you need block picks or fancy tools

296
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,510
or bypass tools

297
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,880
sometimes it's just a matter of having a

298
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,540
piece of plastic or you know like json

299
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,930
saying it's friendly or dopey face

300
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,209
trying to encourage people trying to you

301
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,430
know talk to people and so these it's

302
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,899
not always hey I need to learn I gotta

303
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,760
be awesome I got to be great at Loch

304
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,920
sport and I got to be a fantastic

305
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,800
lock-picker to forget anything yeah and

306
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,240
and that that talent does help I were

307
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,649
definitely not knocking that there have

308
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,320
been instances where we have needed to

309
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,980
pick locks yeah but it we don't use it

310
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,740
very much and then you know these are

311
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,230
pretty big kits so we actually do a lot

312
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,019
of research and work into dumbing these

313
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,350
things down so this is my wallet I keep

314
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:46,269
several things in this very small

315
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,800
traveler's wallet I've got a few

316
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:49,870
different bypass methods and other

317
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,279
things that I keep in here and if you

318
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,820
just look at it just looks like a flat

319
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,949
wallet so also this is a neat little

320
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:01,050
tool that Billy Boatwright had made

321
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:03,729
himself and yeah he just kind of got a

322
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,829
couple picks in there yeah the tensioner

323
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,380
is bent but it's very easy to conceal

324
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:10,779
and it was easy to use and I keep

325
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,519
gaffers tape on a lot of things there's

326
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,730
so many uses for gaffers tape and I'll

327
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,120
show you a sort of a way to maintain

328
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,290
access with some gaffers tape in a bit

329
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,899
again I'm just talking about we like to

330
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,990
take our kits and sort of dumb them down

331
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:29,290
so that we can have tools that we need

332
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:32,620
that we can conceal and so this is a

333
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,099
mini laptop it's the GPD Pro it's about

334
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,990
this big but it's a full working laptop

335
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,100
and of course the Wi-Fi pineapple and

336
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,490
some other tools that you see there

337
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,620
Milky Way

338
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,180
that's a real Milky Way that's when you

339
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,069
get access to a place especially if

340
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,079
there are armed guards sometimes your

341
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:51,370
adrenaline can can be you know going as

342
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,589
you might expect

343
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,839
so I tell people this all the time to

344
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:58,240
like when I first get into a building I

345
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,730
usually go to the bathroom yeah and I

346
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,250
said no high for a bit just to get my

347
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,319
adrenaline and stuff down and I'm not as

348
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,899
sweaty and yeah like I just broke down

349
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:09,760
or snuck in so so the Milky Way or any

350
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,899
type of food when you eat that it helps

351
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,000
to naturally suppress the

352
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,750
fight-or-flight response so it helps you

353
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,670
to serve

354
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,500
chill out and you know get your mindset

355
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,660
it's Tim mentioned plastic door shims

356
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,180
this is this is the tool that I

357
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,000
personally use more than any other tool

358
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,489
to get into places so you can see how

359
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,610
quick this is

360
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:36,070
so this is an office this office is to

361
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,930
one of the executives there and we were

362
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,670
showing them afterwards because we've

363
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,079
got into the facility and then they were

364
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,819
like how did you get in there we're like

365
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,380
well I mean there's a couple different

366
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,490
ways to do it you have a nice window

367
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,560
there so we could have used the under

368
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,700
the door tool and just you know or we

369
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,280
could have just used a piece of paper

370
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:55,810
you know so there's just it's ridiculous

371
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,870
so the cure people think things are

372
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,760
without right so this is a quick war

373
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,900
story and I know I'm actually going to

374
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,390
come back to this to make sure we have

375
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,420
time for other things but this is

376
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:11,069
another video similar to the the bypass

377
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:14,469
with the plastic this is a shove knife

378
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:18,510
so you can see Tim on the other side of

379
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,510
the door so we're going to lock the door

380
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,710
so we'll share this as a double crash

381
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,390
door there's several different ways we

382
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,060
could have bypassed this but this

383
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,140
particular one you'll see here in a

384
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,500
second

385
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,120
I use if you look right here you'll see

386
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,520
it just real quick it'll lat it'll

387
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,930
unlatch the door and then pop open so

388
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,520
what's really funny about this too

389
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,530
though is that they had a PTZ camera

390
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,300
there and it was all scratched up I mean

391
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,160
the dome was all it was a mess it's

392
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,530
really when it was weathered you know

393
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,329
there's moisture in there it's they

394
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,579
would come see us anyway even if we were

395
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,890
trying to stay under the radar even more

396
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,600
yeah and then some more things just sort

397
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,850
of building off of the piece of plastic

398
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,310
or the shove knife you have these

399
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,740
travelers hooks or schrum tools and

400
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,739
they're super useful they have a very

401
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,190
slim profile so it's a lot easier to get

402
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,760
those in in between door frames to avoid

403
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:15,100
doors a lot easier when something like

404
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:20,530
the hall pass or something is too thick

405
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:23,500
to go in there another thing too so talk

406
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,300
about strike plates and it's supposed to

407
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,740
help prevent people from loading the

408
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,339
doors you know because it's supposed to

409
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,530
block

410
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,320
the latch well it's really easy to

411
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:35,020
bypass those two simply by going over

412
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,170
the top of it and pressing down and now

413
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,120
you're loading that door this tool it's

414
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,819
actually about this long and it's metal

415
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,110
so it looks like a weapon so you have a

416
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,460
deeper range yeah

417
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,140
if you're walking around with that in

418
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,030
your bag somewhere like New York or

419
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,199
something and someone questions you it's

420
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,280
not going to be a good day for you so

421
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:56,950
you can do something like that or a coat

422
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,050
hanger so if you just take the bottom

423
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,090
part of the coat hanger down here and

424
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,490
cut that off then you can just put a

425
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,800
slight bend in it and you can put it in

426
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,470
over the top of the striker plate and

427
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,870
just still do the same thing with a coat

428
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:15,700
hanger so the last bolt how do you

429
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,230
prevent this so a good way to do it is

430
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,730
just having your watch bolts that

431
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,580
property so if you look at the security

432
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,070
pin here on the left just making sure

433
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,710
that's set incorrectly a lot of times to

434
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,720
people that install whether their

435
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,640
proximity like badge readers or they're

436
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,620
installing these physical security

437
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,030
controls they're the same guys that

438
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,030
their maintenance guys are wearing

439
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,770
multiple hats so making sure these guys

440
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,689
understand how to implement this this

441
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,670
stuff the hardware and install it

442
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,410
correctly and then securely is very

443
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,130
important yeah and what I mentioned -

444
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,300
this fixes and prevents all those

445
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,410
attacks that we just showed with the

446
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,870
plastic the shrum tools the shove knife

447
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,300
all that stuff those will no longer work

448
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,810
if this pin is correctly set that's all

449
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,729
it takes

450
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,979
so there's a couple different other

451
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,530
tools out there the double door crack or

452
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,140
a double door tool or the crash bar tool

453
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,089
you can get this you can make them in

454
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,000
fact we'll show you the next slide one

455
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,740
that we made but this is really easy

456
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,150
when there's a gap so if there's a gap

457
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,650
there's no a stable or anything like

458
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,420
that protecting you can just shove it in

459
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,760
the middle of the doors turn it and then

460
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,350
just open the doors in the back there

461
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,970
like those this double crash bars

462
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,560
there's a big enough gap where you can

463
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,490
actually put it through the air turn it

464
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:34,500
and open the doors so that's that's

465
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,500
perfect example those doors right there

466
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,820
so

467
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:41,800
this is one that that I made I put

468
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,929
heat-shrink on each side to just try to

469
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,389
prevent scratching for wooden doors

470
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,980
things like that they you just get the

471
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,440
right dimensions you bend it make sure

472
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,860
that it's it's strong enough and there

473
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,330
you go

474
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,120
and it's small enough that you can put

475
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,510
it in the small of your back or

476
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,489
basically in a pocket or something so so

477
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,110
another thing is a deadbolt on Turner

478
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,600
the same thing if you have a gap there

479
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,310
and you can get to the deadbolt that's a

480
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,610
neat little tool that you can turn and

481
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,010
it spins on the tip so it turns the the

482
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,240
deadbolt knob yes if you look at the

483
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,340
slides here I just kind of went through

484
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,660
those but so you put it and these are

485
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,870
really really popular for retail

486
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,970
locations so you just put it there you

487
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,649
insert now you actually put it on the

488
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,630
thumb turn the thumb turn on the other

489
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,230
side and now the doors open and again

490
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:33,550
the windows are super handy yes windows

491
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:36,400
are helpful any hotel you stay in you

492
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:39,190
know we talked I wrote a couple blogs on

493
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,950
hotel rooms security but this is always

494
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,080
an issue but outside of that corporate

495
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,790
offices federal buildings I mean

496
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,550
anywhere you go there's you find these

497
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,649
lever handles they're easily bypassed or

498
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,970
open with under the door tool I'm sure

499
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,370
several you guys are familiar with this

500
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,740
pretty easy to make it looks like this

501
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:59,350
on the right here it's a video of me

502
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,930
doing it in my hotel room a little while

503
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,610
back and this this video creeps a lot of

504
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,620
people out because obviously we're all

505
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,840
staying at a hotel this hotel actually

506
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,909
has these handles in your room yeah

507
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,010
saysay goes under the tool under the

508
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,410
door and then you just find the handle

509
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:18,580
you pull down on the string and voila

510
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:21,880
you bypassed their biometric two-factor

511
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,639
multi-factor pin and fingerprint reader

512
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,200
and badge reader and just by putting a

513
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,880
piece of wire with piano string under

514
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,090
there so how do you fix that

515
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,010
super simple grab a hand towel roll it

516
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,100
up really really tight and this is from

517
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:38,770
my roommate from Def Con last year yeah

518
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,260
for reason for reason stuff so just

519
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,440
shove it in that now that wire cannot

520
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,350
get under there if you want a long-term

521
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,750
solution just get something that you can

522
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,669
put two on the door that blocks

523
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,810
from going over there because some

524
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,120
people have to have these love handles

525
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,679
right there's some that are beveled the

526
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,070
little slide off so it doesn't get a

527
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,180
good latch on but yeah I think the guy

528
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,129
on the right there's usually what we

529
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,680
recommend to some of our clients yeah

530
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,810
and then Tim using the window just

531
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:12,280
watching it go right on the handle so

532
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:14,440
that's helpful too and then request for

533
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,889
exit sensors we love to bypass these

534
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,720
things because if I were to make up some

535
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,460
sort of a really good percentage like

536
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,170
99% of the time

537
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,690
that'd probably be pretty accurate with

538
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,660
with the amount of sensors that we

539
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:31,120
bypass I would say tailgating and then

540
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,940
bypassing wreck sensors that are too

541
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,000
taught to always infiltrate a building

542
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,580
yep so they're they're usually too close

543
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,050
to the door and their angle is is too

544
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,740
far down

545
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:47,080
so just by inserting canned air spraying

546
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,420
it it trips the sensor because you have

547
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,800
motion from the air and then that canned

548
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,200
air is colder so there's your

549
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,780
temperature variance yes so the rank

550
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,370
sensors aren't MP of the temperature

551
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,960
fluctuations and what signals it along

552
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:04,899
with the movement it's not just movement

553
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,190
yes yeah you do a lot of stuff like that

554
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,150
if they give you at all them did it with

555
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,110
a with some scotch

556
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:13,930
so yeah yeah I think Dave Kennedy did it

557
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,429
with a bait yeah but yeah yeah but the

558
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,170
thing with the canned air is that it is

559
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,760
cold enough so and some of the water

560
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,320
could be colder water to it just needs

561
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,450
to have that different temperature

562
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,980
variance to trip the ones that read

563
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,980
temperature fluctuations yep

564
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,380
so here's a quick video this shows Tim

565
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,890
and I getting access from an external

566
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:35,350
door through two internal doors into the

567
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,990
target area that we were tasked with

568
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,840
with trying to access you'll see a few

569
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,250
things here Tim you know we'll see well

570
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,340
let me go ahead and say this this is a

571
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,770
this is after we did it because the

572
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,870
client said hey how did you guys do that

573
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,430
and we were like oh well quarter video

574
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:58,310
for you that way you can show your guys

575
00:21:51,430 --> 00:22:02,450
and now you know how yes I go back so

576
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:07,250
this so this is where with a paper clip

577
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,350
so the magnetic the magnetic locks like

578
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,750
flawed things like that you can

579
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,340
completely basically disable those by

580
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,570
putting something up there like a

581
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:20,090
paperclip now I will caution

582
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,740
obviously that looks awful so if

583
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,629
anyone's doing door checks or paying

584
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,670
attention

585
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,190
why is a paperclip stuck to the door

586
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:31,280
with tape that's one good way to check

587
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,990
incident response so you can see I just

588
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:41,120
pull the door right open there's there's

589
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:45,170
no resistance on that at all so yeah

590
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,149
we'll watch the rest of this video can

591
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,980
you hear that out there ttle okay that's

592
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,440
alright so just basically on the other

593
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,660
side of that door is another door with a

594
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,670
fingerprint reader and a badge reader at

595
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,710
this door like you have to you have to

596
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,270
badge in to get to this door too bad you

597
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,390
and to get to a fingerprint reader to

598
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,190
badge in and then you're into the target

599
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,550
zone so this is the fingerprint reader

600
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,050
here I do want to say make sure you

601
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,139
carry two straws with you with the

602
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,690
canned air at least at least two straws

603
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,200
this is pretty places I'm doing it and I

604
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,960
shoot the straw off like oh now he's

605
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,960
trying to house dry hits he's like he's

606
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:29,600
like yeah the straw came off see it

607
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,710
struck him up so we round to positive

608
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,060
put it on there and that's just full

609
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,560
disclosure you know we're not trying to

610
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,179
go through and look like we do

611
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,260
everything perfect if we mess up we're

612
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:41,300
gonna tell you we messed up so yeah and

613
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,170
they're actually the video of a coat

614
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:47,800
hanger and hand warmer there under the

615
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:50,990
door tool and a hand warmer as well oh

616
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,940
just to grab petroi oh yeah yeah when we

617
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,880
when we actually open this door the

618
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,220
straw was probably a good sesh I mean it

619
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,270
was it was gone but also be aware of

620
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,760
chemical burns

621
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,920
yeah um when you use canned air

622
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,980
especially turning that upside down snow

623
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,630
fun when you get it on your skin so in

624
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,090
and there just talked about that so this

625
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,110
was this is one of my favorite

626
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,480
assessments today

627
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,760
when they they're like oh we've just

628
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,000
spent we've spent so much money on all

629
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,500
new access controls on this brand-new

630
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,090
data center and we'll call it we'll call

631
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,720
it the super secure data center in

632
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:28,250
Washington and and so after we were told

633
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,620
that we will not be able to get into

634
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:34,460
there this is us doing a video of me

635
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:36,139
getting into a cage so so we didn't have

636
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,390
canned air this time but we needed other

637
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,610
temperature variants and then

638
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,200
we also needed motion so we use the end

639
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,689
of the door tool that was in my bag and

640
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,179
Brent had a hand warmer in his bag and a

641
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,580
hack the planet bracelet yep and if you

642
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:52,399
watch the badge reader right about there

643
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:55,820
there turned green and thank you yeah

644
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:57,500
we're inside so super easy yeah so your

645
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,029
gates and your fences if you have

646
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,789
requests for exit or anything like that

647
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:03,470
don't don't use those it's defeats the

648
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:10,158
purpose yeah at least into such a small

649
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:11,929
cage yep so we're talking about like the

650
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,019
shove bar so if you're trying to attack

651
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,700
these crash bars or put canned air in to

652
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:19,159
trip the wreck sensor how do you stop

653
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,360
those things well the the reason you're

654
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,340
able to do that is because there's a

655
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,469
physical gap in the door if you remove

656
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,049
that gap or you cover that gap with an

657
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,840
astragal there's no way for those

658
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:31,879
attacks to work anymore unless somehow

659
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,250
there's enough room to go under the door

660
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,230
but you can also put weather stripping

661
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,309
and other things there that will help

662
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,080
close those gaps

663
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:44,510
now all those attacks you've just seen

664
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:47,750
they don't work except for this so again

665
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:49,960
back to the magnetic locks you can see

666
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,429
that paperclip sticking out looks awful

667
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,289
one of the things one of the reasons I

668
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:55,970
carry gaffers tape you remember the the

669
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:58,309
ink pen earlier where I had gaffers tape

670
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,620
wrapped around the top of it so if you

671
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:04,010
take a strip of gaffers tape just maybe

672
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,989
three four inches and as long as it's at

673
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,658
least an inch wide you can take that off

674
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,450
you can stick it up there and it

675
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:13,190
actually blends in really well and the

676
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,320
best thing about that is there still

677
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,880
resistance on the door so when they come

678
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,220
around and they do door checks and they

679
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,159
pull on it it's going to seem normal but

680
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,900
when you need access again you just give

681
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,300
it a good strong tug and

682
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,910
you're in so also some of the sensors to

683
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,830
won't trip that that door is open

684
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,450
because it's so thin and there's they're

685
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,580
still receiving that signal that the

686
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:38,960
door is closed on some of the monitoring

687
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:40,790
devices yep so again tailgating

688
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:49,400
piggybacking free entry that's the thing

689
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:50,960
we do all the time yes question right

690
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,240
yeah you do need request for accident

691
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,280
it's just the way

692
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,990
well the request for exit to is also

693
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,240
just where you position it but yeah the

694
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,500
mag lots I think it's just making sure

695
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,270
you're actually checking the doors

696
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,800
because what happens is people just some

697
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,120
people don't even check doors at all I

698
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,590
know their guards will just walk around

699
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,449
and they'll badge in and then they'll go

700
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,709
back in or out of the building so it's

701
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,090
important that if you have guards that

702
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,930
you're actually checking these doors

703
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:17,000
pull on them make sure there's no tape

704
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,890
on the the latching mechanisms or the

705
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,140
magnetic lock yeah there are

706
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,870
alternatives to the the exposed mag

707
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:27,020
locks like that where they actually lock

708
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:29,120
inside of the door frame so once you

709
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,070
open it you there's not really a way to

710
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,260
disable the mag lock because it isn't

711
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,450
exposed that like that so there are

712
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,030
there are alternatives that are a bit

713
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:45,560
more secure there another hand another

714
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:47,780
question yes that's a good question but

715
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,330
it's gonna take a really well I didn't I

716
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,580
didn't I didn't want to eat too much so

717
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,340
yeah so yeah it's all getting

718
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,040
piggybacking you know just a friendly

719
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,350
facing you know you sure your charisma

720
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,850
or I look busy I mean we're not gonna

721
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,290
get into this too much cuz a lot of our

722
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,209
talks we talk about social engineering

723
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:08,060
and you know Jason did a good job

724
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:10,640
covering that but tailgating again it's

725
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:13,220
one of the top ways with any of us get

726
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,290
into buildings yeah and that's just to

727
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,420
you know to add on to what Jason was

728
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:20,540
saying earlier it's such an easy way to

729
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,790
get in a very common way it's a natural

730
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,310
human for humans to want to help each

731
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,780
other and so unfortunately when we have

732
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,610
to think like bad guys we have to

733
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,530
exploit that exploit people's kindness

734
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,159
which is an awful thing to say but

735
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:35,450
that's what that's what bad guys do so

736
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,250
nice purse

737
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,840
stupid bad guys ways to prevent this you

738
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,790
know Jason I mentioned too like this is

739
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,590
a big open floor plan that's monitored

740
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,570
it's pretty intimidating when you walk

741
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,520
in right and then having a guard there

742
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,260
that's actually doing their job but

743
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,800
there are mantrap security doors there's

744
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:55,429
other man traps out there that help to

745
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,860
reduce piggybacking so some of the best

746
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:01,470
best tailgating prevention systems that

747
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,419
I've seen I'm not going to

748
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,130
vendor-specific but I do want to mention

749
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,559
one boo Needham

750
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,809
they make a really really high secure

751
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,730
mechanism like this one you see it's a

752
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:14,428
turnstile and it has this cool thing

753
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,860
called stereo vision in it and so when

754
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,750
someone is walking in it will sense if

755
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,100
there is more than one person trying to

756
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,320
go in at once and so it will

757
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,449
automatically walk you in that area it

758
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,178
also has detection that you can set to

759
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,590
where if an individual is walking

760
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,690
through this area and they've badged in

761
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,750
and they have an item that's in the

762
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,890
shape of a weapon it will also alert so

763
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,200
there's a lot of cool things that you

764
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:40,980
can tweak pressure Floor Mats things

765
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,040
like that so there are ways to to work

766
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,610
towards mitigating tale piggybacking

767
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,500
tailgating whatever you want to call it

768
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,449
earlier Jason mentioned seeing the the

769
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,120
pin like where there rubbed off it's

770
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,309
been used a lot you can tell which code

771
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,260
you can kind of let narrow it down this

772
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,020
is a way that Bret and I like to do it

773
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,080
sometimes just using a sharp or

774
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:06,179
highlighter to highlight the numbers and

775
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,010
then before someone comes in before gets

776
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,780
really busy and then you can just go

777
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:13,410
back and you can use the UV light to see

778
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,970
which pens or numbers they're pushing

779
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,130
that way you can kind of reduce the

780
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:20,429
amount of guesses that you're aiming for

781
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:22,679
yeah so I've put a lot of time sort of

782
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:24,300
researching this now there are certain

783
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,910
confess like rubber pin pads and things

784
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,970
where Sharpie is not the best medium to

785
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,800
use however common it's pretty common

786
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,020
that I've seen four garages things like

787
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,840
that to have more weather resistant

788
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,639
buttons such as plastic or metal so if

789
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,010
you use the sharpies and they have to be

790
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,040
the older sharpies that don't say smudge

791
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,770
free so if it's just an old school are

792
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,730
really cheap sharpie then it gives you a

793
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,520
good

794
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,550
six to maybe eight nine minutes before

795
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:56,700
it dries but it's plenty enough time to

796
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:59,250
run up and paint the pad clone someone's

797
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,560
badge and then go see what buttons they

798
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:04,080
push again as Jason mentioned now we

799
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,690
know at least the four buttons that were

800
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,139
pushed to bring it down to a 21 now we

801
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:13,070
have 21 guesses for that so it's just a

802
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,150
quick quick cheap way to try to to

803
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:20,310
decrease the amount of guesses you have

804
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:21,870
to take with a PIN pad real quick shot

805
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,970
out devian olam he's done a lot of

806
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:28,860
research for things that are keyed the

807
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:31,320
same and so this is a sample key kit

808
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,179
that we used thanks to his

809
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,060
recommendations and so when you find

810
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:39,000
things like Dorking access controls you

811
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,790
can buy the master key off of Amazon or

812
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,830
any other place so when you see a common

813
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,960
door King access control you just unlock

814
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,870
it you open it and there's a postal

815
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,490
service button that you push and

816
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:55,020
whatever door they have assigned to that

817
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,850
will open so yeah police getting you

818
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,940
through the first layer of physical

819
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,830
right that barrier so what to look for

820
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,000
when you get inside you know one of the

821
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,639
things we like to look for service

822
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,100
elevators I usually have unrestricted

823
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,780
access you can get to you can use fire

824
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,929
keys there are keys out there that you

825
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,610
can use to bypass badge restricted

826
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,130
floors but you know some of the newer

827
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,169
elevators have different keys you know

828
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,520
there's different sets out there but

829
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,860
it's just easier to find a service

830
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,600
elevator and and use that all them times

831
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,810
- they don't have cameras for some

832
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,480
reason I don't know why that is but it

833
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,790
is a common case yeah my favorite thing

834
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,220
about finding service elevators is that

835
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,230
they're they're often used by you know

836
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,570
if there's some sort of a food crew or

837
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,130
cleaning crew or something it the reason

838
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,290
they use that other than the full access

839
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,800
to all floors is that they are often

840
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:48,300
back out of view of the public so when

841
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,100
you're using this you're not right

842
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,690
you're not in the main lobby most of the

843
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,030
time where it's easier to be noticed

844
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,920
you're back out of the way

845
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:58,920
so that you're not getting in the way

846
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,450
and so it's just it's a good find also

847
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,400
if you're wearing like maintenance

848
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,290
outfit or something like that and you

849
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,430
know you're it's more appropriate for

850
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,290
you to fit in and no one's really going

851
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,000
to question while you're entering the

852
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,639
loading dock area and going to the

853
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,840
service area or a hive is vast right

854
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,590
there's so many things padlocks there's

855
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,120
a lot of really bad ones there's some

856
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,010
master lock is not the master of much

857
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,100
yeah does anybody notice the theme with

858
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,810
our pictures up there yeah so there's

859
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,969
several ways to bypass these you know

860
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,639
shims things like that we usually carry

861
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,670
a handful of of shims on us in case we

862
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,410
can't pick the lock or or something or

863
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:39,720
have a harder time if it's a combination

864
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:42,330
lock it's easy to bypass combination

865
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,280
locks with the shim if they've got the

866
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,750
hook on both sides teeth on both sides

867
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,030
you can use two shims

868
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,800
Jong on some of them you know there's a

869
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,629
lot of good locks out there too so just

870
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,240
make sure that when you're when you're

871
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:57,120
getting padlocks don't don't go to

872
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,740
Walmart and just buy the master locks in

873
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,629
the hardware section yeah if you really

874
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,840
want to protect it and you know don't do

875
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,920
that and there's even one you can google

876
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,449
I'm not going to point it out but

877
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,429
there's one on here that you can open

878
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,770
simply by hitting it in the right spot

879
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,300
with a hammer yeah see yeah if you guys

880
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,370
go to any lock picking village at any

881
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,350
hacker con you're gonna see a bunch of

882
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,638
these locks why are they there it's

883
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,110
because they're they're pretty easy to

884
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,200
pick and that's usually where you can

885
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,330
get star hits yeah beginner locks and

886
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:28,918
they if you whisper gently to one that

887
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:32,129
will open as well so we like to look for

888
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,859
hinge pins a lot of times in commercial

889
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:36,418
settings with the proper doors this

890
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:40,919
isn't really something you see a lot

891
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:43,440
however there are times where we've been

892
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,330
on commercial style sites like

893
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,090
warehouses things like that or they just

894
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:50,340
want a quick entry door and they expose

895
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,780
the hinge pins externally so you don't

896
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,179
need to unlock the door when you can

897
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,010
just take the door off it's amazing -

898
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,230
when the client does you're in something

899
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,730
like that property management it's

900
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,950
that's when I did some of their doors

901
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,900
they had the hinge pins outside but they

902
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:08,100
had

903
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:09,870
they had a retinal scanners yes so it's

904
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,630
like man you just made a lot of money to

905
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:15,960
put that fancy eyeball reader there yeah

906
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:18,810
let me use my pen dollar tool yeah so

907
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,740
the banget is a handy little tool that

908
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:24,660
just you know you can just black it real

909
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,799
real hard with a hammer or whatever

910
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,210
you're not gonna carry a hammer on you

911
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,310
but you can pick a lot of different

912
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,320
things to just like a bump hammer bump

913
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,180
hammer we invite these that actually

914
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,780
works with it so it just knocks the pin

915
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,460
up pretty easily a quick fix for that if

916
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,280
your hinge pins are exposed and there's

917
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,810
not really a way to mitigate that what

918
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,870
you can do is buy these really cheap

919
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,279
things called

920
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,029
security pins like the door hinge

921
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,620
security pins

922
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,870
so you take one screw out on one side

923
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,819
one screw out on the other side

924
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:56,310
leave that hole open and on the other

925
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,710
side you put this guy in so now when the

926
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,960
doors closed this actually goes into

927
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,210
that so even if I take those those hinge

928
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,310
pins off I can't lift that door up now

929
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,660
because it's stuck into place so and

930
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:13,170
they're pretty cheap too that's it's a

931
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:15,569
cheap remediation so keys fun story

932
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:18,690
Brett and I got into a security control

933
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:21,270
room picked their they had a like a

934
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:24,240
wafer style lock on an aluminum box that

935
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,340
housed their keys so we were able to

936
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,020
pick that really quick we got in there

937
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,180
and then we were doing an assessment at

938
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,790
a different data center

939
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:36,120
a couple days after it's same client

940
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:38,700
different location when I ran there were

941
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,930
like holy crap look at this key and they

942
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:45,450
marked it and it said XYZ data center

943
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:47,850
huh and so we took a picture of it we

944
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,649
went to Lowe's we bought a file key

945
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,870
blank key and we played arts and crafts

946
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,710
in our hotel room lobby for for a while

947
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,560
and it worked

948
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,140
yeah drew Culbertson help with that too

949
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,520
you know so don't take don't take

950
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,470
pictures of your keys either and put

951
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,090
them on lines because of stuff like this

952
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,160
because that's exactly what we do they

953
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:07,220
just took different angles got clothes

954
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,339
we measured it all this stuff very

955
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:13,230
highly technical arts and crafts but

956
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,940
there are also on-site field duplicator

957
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,079
kits out there too or you can actually

958
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,910
duplicate

959
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,749
while you're there yep badge emulation

960
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,308
sometimes you don't have to clone a

961
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:25,379
badge there's been several times where

962
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:27,809
we've just seen what they look like go

963
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,940
back to the hotel craft something up in

964
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:33,569
Photoshop or your image editor of choice

965
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,119
and print it off we've even had a guy

966
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:38,369
that we know that you got access to a

967
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,859
pretty secure area with just a piece of

968
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,749
paper that he drew on with some random

969
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:45,450
thing with a red crayon yeah I got him

970
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:47,129
random marks I got access to a health it

971
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,229
was like a health processing place and

972
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:52,319
got inside I found one of their letter

973
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:54,029
heads and I had a sleeve for a badge an

974
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:56,038
H ID badge if I want their letter heads

975
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:58,049
like their envelope that had their logo

976
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:00,509
on it cut that up and I cut another

977
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:02,970
thing and I made a made a badge just by

978
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:05,069
cutting and putting layers of other

979
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,169
stuff you did that while you were inside

980
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:08,759
of this yeah I did it inside I did it in

981
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,410
a conference room while I was setting up

982
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:11,819
a access point to make sure they could

983
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,828
read it from the parking lot and I was

984
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:15,930
just super cutting it out I locked the

985
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:17,789
door to make my own office so it's

986
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,009
pretty fun yeah it's fun yeah if you can

987
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:22,559
find a conference center or a conference

988
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:24,059
room or an office you can get into it's

989
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,499
pretty cool go in there and you just

990
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,210
lock the door you plug into the network

991
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:29,339
and you do whatever and then when

992
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,349
someone starts knocking they're like one

993
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,729
second I'm changing or something like

994
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:34,769
that you know just to okay

995
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:38,489
come back there's a lot of different

996
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:39,959
ways you can you can do that bad

997
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:42,210
clothing we do a lot of batch cloning as

998
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,710
well some clients like to know hey is

999
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,019
our badge easy the clone or it

1000
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,119
replicates and most of the times it is

1001
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:50,430
because people go with the stock hid

1002
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,410
badges you can use several different

1003
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,969
things to do this our favorite is just

1004
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,529
the proxmark there's a couple there's

1005
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:57,960
newer versions of this but the proxmark

1006
00:38:55,529 --> 00:39:00,569
3 and the proxmark very easy that's kind

1007
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,219
of our defaults we usually set ones low

1008
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:03,930
frequency and one to high frequency

1009
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:05,609
there's different ways to do this

1010
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:10,200
there's toggle pins you could have the

1011
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:12,180
same the same or a beat reader replay

1012
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,788
and stuff you can set it to low or high

1013
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,069
and just toggle that but this is just

1014
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:18,900
kind of our setup in one appoint go back

1015
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:21,569
real quick so this this is from

1016
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:25,319
dangerous things calm it's a little

1017
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:27,299
wallet size RFID checker and so when we

1018
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:29,550
are not sure if someone's badge reader

1019
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:31,410
is in set to low or high frequency

1020
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,450
you can walk up to it with this and it

1021
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,160
will flash and tell you if it's low or

1022
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,930
high frequency just fisting your wallet

1023
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,549
too and it's a little powered thing and

1024
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:42,629
it will glow whether it's low frequency

1025
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:44,550
or high frequency yeah cool so one of

1026
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,360
the things we love to do with clipboards

1027
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:50,700
we like to I guess weaponize them that's

1028
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,440
still the cool terms that I use but we

1029
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,080
basically put a bad corners in there

1030
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,470
this is my cheap quick setup you can

1031
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,750
tell I took the proxmark I just used

1032
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:03,230
some gaffers tape to fix the antennas

1033
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:05,880
and the device and then a battery inside

1034
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,350
of course on the top all the way papers

1035
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,480
on top of it like you know some

1036
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,950
printouts to make it look like it's

1037
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,650
something legitimate for whatever the

1038
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,689
case is one of the things I like to do

1039
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,430
is inventory so I'm doing an inventory

1040
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,710
of I'm getting the serial numbers off of

1041
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,210
the servers for different things I

1042
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,740
walked up to a security guard and I was

1043
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,900
like went over to the security system

1044
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,129
and I started writing stuff down he

1045
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,060
didn't really he was like we do it I'm

1046
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,610
like oh we're just taking inventory

1047
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,870
because we're gonna replace these later

1048
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,370
just need to get the serial number and

1049
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,810
then we had a conversation established

1050
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:37,770
for core and he let me in a bit a Center

1051
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:41,040
later but using the clipboard is a handy

1052
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:44,090
prop this is a fancier older version

1053
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,700
this is Tim's of my covert clipboard

1054
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:48,750
fancy-shmancy you know so I've just got

1055
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,370
a PI in there I've got a few different

1056
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,930
antennas on the top there and I've also

1057
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:54,710
got the proxmark there he can watch

1058
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:57,899
Netflix with it - yeah I got a wireless

1059
00:40:54,710 --> 00:41:00,270
wireless USB that you can SSH into so

1060
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,250
you can as somebody else can just as

1061
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,170
you're sitting there reading badges they

1062
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:11,760
can clone them from the car or something

1063
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:13,590
I like the wave at the end so this is

1064
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,570
actually one of my favorites yeah love

1065
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:18,540
this one is a great favorite stories

1066
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:21,720
Brett and I it was a really highly

1067
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,860
secured facility and we knew it was

1068
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,089
gonna be hard to get into there because

1069
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,670
we did an assessment there a couple

1070
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:28,170
years before we also knew that some of

1071
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,480
the people there watch our Def Con talks

1072
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,640
and such and we found that out Deering

1073
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,650
yeah Deering which is funny because they

1074
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,730
let us in we tailgate it and we're going

1075
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,920
through like they turn it around they're

1076
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,280
like wait a minute like aren't you Kevin

1077
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,310
branch away

1078
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,930
like wise like I saw your talk at Def

1079
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,180
Con it was like are you social

1080
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:48,370
engineering yeah I know and they say are

1081
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,169
you are you doing an assessment against

1082
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,250
us right now and we're like no man we're

1083
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,140

1084
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,840
everything I was like okay I'm going to

1085
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,700
keep my own we're like all right all

1086
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,960
right while you're keeping your eye on

1087
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,160
this we're gonna go sitting here in this

1088
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,790
conference room while we're waiting for

1089
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,549
so-and-so so it was like his desk is

1090
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:09,160
right on top I start running yeah we

1091
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,440
both like the phone so I get that

1092
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,940
Network tax that's ten plugs directly in

1093
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,640
the wall so we're both sitting there

1094
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,290
with our laptops that both have these

1095
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,180
this is a laptop it's got hacker

1096
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,040
stickers all over it and we're facing

1097
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,600
the dude so he sees the back of the

1098
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,520
laptop and he's just sitting there

1099
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,710
looking at us and talking like whatever

1100
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,930
he's talking about to his coworkers so I

1101
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,340
you know make a fake phone call it's

1102
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,440
like oh that sucks you're not gonna be

1103
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,790
able to make it all right all right

1104
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,230
we'll meet you at the other place and

1105
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,029
like a man's phone so I can't make it

1106
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:39,040
sorry to bother guys we'll see you later

1107
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:41,260
and then we yeah because the garage goes

1108
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,020
straight so yeah yeah we walk out of

1109
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,420
there with some information yeah it was

1110
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,920
fun all right so but real quick on this

1111
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,910
this guy here how do we get into the

1112
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,060
building

1113
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:54,490
Brett and I had set those badge readers

1114
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,950
we shoved them in a coffee cup and we

1115
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,270
shoved them in a muffin bag and then we

1116
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:02,439
went out where actually people were

1117
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:04,270
smoking we hung out pretend to be

1118
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,890
smokers as well which you know there are

1119
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,200
still some smoking areas some places

1120
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,910
there's not anymore but this place

1121
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,220
fortunately had one and we went over the

1122
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,480
guy had a lanyard and it was the same

1123
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,029
color as mine it looked like from a

1124
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,770
conference and I had my coffee cup I was

1125
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,900
like hey man you got that same same

1126
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:23,680
lanyard yeah and I had my muffin bag and

1127
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,450
I was like oh we both cloned his badge

1128
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,649
and then we waited for her to go and we

1129
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,120
just went to the front door and I'm

1130
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,530
using his badge to go through the front

1131
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,839
door as he went into the back door but

1132
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:33,910
the funniest part about that was as you

1133
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,560
go in the main door there was the guard

1134
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,899
station right there and with the glass

1135
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,660
and there they can be conscious of who's

1136
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,060
coming and going so the employee uses

1137
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,220
his badge ten badges in with his coffee

1138
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:49,540
cup and then I badge them with my muffin

1139
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:51,730
bag you know the female name right

1140
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,520
there's a dude here and there's a female

1141
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,620
name

1142
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,360
just popped up using that badge it's the

1143
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,799
same thing if the guys badging in three

1144
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,970
times in a row that's probably uh

1145
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,890
there's something going on there right

1146
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,509
something's like we used that same badge

1147
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,400
to badge in across the facility and he

1148
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,840
went upstairs we went downstairs we

1149
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,200
gotta have a data center using his badge

1150
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,900
yeah so this is one of my toys that I

1151
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,020
like this is kind of a long long range

1152
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,940
low frequency cloner kind of a big

1153
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,250
footprint seen at a decent size backpack

1154
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,050
for it but it's cool I can set it up

1155
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,960
somewhere clone badges connect to it

1156
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:26,420
wirelessly and see what I have and then

1157
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:30,080
use a smaller proxmark to write that

1158
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:31,490
badge if you've seen a mr. robot -

1159
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,540
that's that's what they use in the

1160
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:38,140
coffee shop there so this is a I

1161
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,370
actually got this from a security guard

1162
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,259
walk up to the security guard was just

1163
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,029
making friendly conversation Brent was

1164
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,540
talking to him distracting him and I

1165
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:49,460
cloned his badge and then I got through

1166
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,750
through the okay last man trap using the

1167
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,540
security cards match which is handy

1168
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:55,820
security guard badges are great to

1169
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:58,820
replicate because they have access of

1170
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,650
everything so so Tim is holding the bad

1171
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,850
cloner his hand like this and he's

1172
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,290
talking to the security guard early

1173
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,850
career and they said this is the guards

1174
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,620
badge and he's like you thought yeah man

1175
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,670
he's and he's getting it sets in there

1176
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,560
like pushing the button doesn't know

1177
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,630
what I'm doing I was just consumer tried

1178
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,750
it this one to get caught and we're like

1179
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:18,130
yeah and while he's talking to the guy

1180
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:20,690
looking at him he just does that

1181
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:22,940
clueless he didn't even I don't think he

1182
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:25,280
even noticed Tim just put his hand up to

1183
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,620
him yeah it was amazing it's awesome

1184
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,930
there's different little things you can

1185
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:33,109
do too for example the garage readers

1186
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,299
this is what actually built his his

1187
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,520
proxmark into to get that heart that

1188
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,160
bigger antenna but the garage readers

1189
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,230
here you can use a blinky you can use

1190
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,560
ESP key these are things that you just

1191
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:47,390
plug in a little vampire clips plug in

1192
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,920
there any can bluetooth into it and you

1193
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,900
can replay

1194
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,300
ask people badge in and out you can

1195
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,920
replay their badges via bluetooth yeah

1196
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,290
and they have a mobile app too which is

1197
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,940
super handy so just as you walk up to it

1198
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,640
you just pick what badge you want to

1199
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,320
replay and you're you're in so we're

1200
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,368
gonna speed through the rest of this

1201
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,509
here running

1202
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,309
sometimes so yeah USB attacks don't

1203
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:11,930
expose these things where anybody can

1204
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:15,229
walk up and just plug something into it

1205
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:18,649
this was from a pretty large place they

1206
00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:20,089
were remodeling so excuse our mess I'm

1207
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,180
just like okay thanks for the free be

1208
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:26,390
there don't do this if you don't need

1209
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,729
USB ports on your systems disable them

1210
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,279
physically block them or just disable

1211
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:34,549
them here's some of the you know attacks

1212
00:46:31,279 --> 00:46:36,979
you can use you know whatever hack five

1213
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:38,479
comes up with their verbage name in

1214
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:40,609
there we gave them some name options

1215
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:46,968
there at the bottom if if Darren wants

1216
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:49,098
to use any of those so one of my

1217
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:51,799
favorite tools too it's it's basically

1218
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:54,319
the rubber ducky but it has a wireless

1219
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:56,479
access point into it built into it so

1220
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,099
when you plug that in and there's a

1221
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:59,749
really cool mobile app and these things

1222
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:01,519
are super cheap so once you plug it in I

1223
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:03,738
connect to the access point on this

1224
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,629
thing and I inject whatever commands I

1225
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:07,779
want directly into that system it's

1226
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:11,630
really cool

1227
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:13,430
disguising your USBs to like this go my

1228
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,469
internal putting tape on it says do not

1229
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:17,419
remove yeah do you notice a theme there

1230
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:18,979
so you see that and then on this next

1231
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,680
one speed test you know I'm gonna remove

1232
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:24,200
all of my all of my devices that I drop

1233
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,368
I put that on there big yellow tape

1234
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,149
because I don't want somebody saying oh

1235
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:30,680
I'm not totally even that old-school a

1236
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:33,380
capo employ years ago have you know we

1237
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,879
still use that case like sometimes

1238
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,890
because it's a people don't really

1239
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,140
question it you know unless you've got

1240
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:41,089
your don't don't use what I'm saying is

1241
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,710
don't use a Raspberry Pi with a clear

1242
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:47,328
case and all your hacker stickers and

1243
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:52,039
antennas sticking all over it well oops

1244
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:53,930
oops so another thing to look forward

1245
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,839
that's the top of my head cuz Tim's a

1246
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:59,058
lot taller than I am taking a picture

1247
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:01,489
that way yeah we're here in the we're in

1248
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:04,489
the server room and they had their

1249
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:06,950
camera system there so why not you know

1250
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:08,869
disable the cameras for a bit or

1251
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,848
whatever else we wanted to do with that

1252
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:13,130
particular system and this other side is

1253
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:14,839
funny I got into a human resource like a

1254
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:17,359
dimple lock I was able to pick it and

1255
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:19,339
get into where they store employee

1256
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,960
records and they kept the Social

1257
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:23,630
Security numbers on the top of the

1258
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,390
things with the names so it would be

1259
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:32,269
like like Street Jason and then it's so

1260
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:34,190
that's how they organized everything so

1261
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:35,930
I took a picture of that and then I had

1262
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:39,650
like I don't know how many identities in

1263
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:41,210
one picture yeah is that the one or is

1264
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,829
it a different one where you are point

1265
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:46,369
of contact you actually pulled it it was

1266
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:49,730
his yeah I found the Donskoy record and

1267
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:51,739
I stole it and then I went to his office

1268
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,710
where he wasn't there we got into his

1269
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:56,900
office and our latest his employee

1270
00:48:54,710 --> 00:49:00,079
record on his desk with a post-it that

1271
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:09,440
said here you go in our card which later

1272
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:12,079
on he said man I can't see that this is

1273
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,999
a funny one too they so we had been in

1274
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,769
this place for a while and this is Tim

1275
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:17,598
on top of a vending machine with his

1276
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:20,839
head in the ceiling or to the right

1277
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:23,239
right here was the entrance for the

1278
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,160
cafeteria this was at lunchtime people

1279
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:27,259
weren't going in and out for lunch no

1280
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,730
one stopped and said hey why is that guy

1281
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:30,440
on top of the vending machine with his

1282
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:31,700
head in the roof and why was I doing

1283
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,890
because in front of me is the data

1284
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,868
center and they didn't have a firewall

1285
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:38,749
or floor-to-ceiling yeah and so I was

1286
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:40,430
able to write all over it you know again

1287
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:42,470
your shredder bins don't have crappy

1288
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,759
shoulder bins yeah we had this game we

1289
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,709
play where we stick our hands in there

1290
00:49:43,759 --> 00:49:46,549
and pull it out and it's called shredder

1291
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,710
bin bingo

1292
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:50,480
so whoever whoever gets the coolest

1293
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,970
document wins and the other person buys

1294
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,410
them a beer or something later so

1295
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,700
unlocked workstations we always look for

1296
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,109
this stuff you know if it's already

1297
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,538
unlocked and you know thanks for the

1298
00:49:57,109 --> 00:50:01,430
help you guys have done us a solid it's

1299
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:04,009
kind of hard to see this but this was

1300
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:07,489
this was left unlocked and it was on

1301
00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:09,049
product price management so that that

1302
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:10,640
could have been leaving keys in your

1303
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:13,069
server racks that you're trying to

1304
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,598
restrict and keeping ladders in there

1305
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:15,650
for us because this is funny because if

1306
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,170
you look at the top where they run the

1307
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:21,349
cable this is segmented because it's two

1308
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:24,039
different companies I fit through there

1309
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:24,039
just not why I

1310
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:31,058
stay out yeah if you want somebody to

1311
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:32,529
stay out of something don't put that on

1312
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:34,509
there because then they're going to go

1313
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:38,019
in there yeah so what was in there was a

1314
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:39,549
bunch of keys to desk yeah in an

1315
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:42,098
unmarked that I was like well I have to

1316
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:43,509
take a picture of this so Jason

1317
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:44,710
mentioned this to post-its and then

1318
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:47,200
writing your password underneath the

1319
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:49,089
keyboards you know yeah it we'd see this

1320
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,049
all the time I'm home all the time all

1321
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:54,609
the time and it's ridiculous we also see

1322
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:58,839
yeah but wait there's more

1323
00:50:54,609 --> 00:51:00,788
these yes I have I have seen probably I

1324
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:02,410
don't know I've seen probably ten of

1325
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:04,750
these and burned the last few years

1326
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:06,519
because you know targets and stuff they

1327
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:09,339
sell these things and and it's actually

1328
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:12,189
litter like titled you know your

1329
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:14,200
password log book yeah password yeah

1330
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,130
don't use those just to speed through

1331
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,140
this because I know we're kind of

1332
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:18,730
running over a little bit you know a

1333
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,078
couple different assessments where you

1334
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,880
just establish that rapport you get

1335
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,589
close to them you get nice with them

1336
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,269
even tell them that you're like this

1337
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:27,640
security guard that I'm making laughs

1338
00:51:25,269 --> 00:51:29,740
Brent and I went up there that I reckon

1339
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,328
them to be an auditor Brent was one of

1340
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:34,390
the guys from another office who was a

1341
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:36,549
manager and he was escorting me as a

1342
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,170
contractor they're doing a NIST

1343
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:39,788
assessment he's wearing and I was

1344
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,920
wondering how they handled their badges

1345
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:44,200
there one day badges and such and she

1346
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,849
began to explain to me and I said oh do

1347
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,279
you have these badges are these badges

1348
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:50,079
active yes here's a whole binder full

1349
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:51,609
and then they give me like a binder full

1350
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,920
of badges and I've got that board there

1351
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,299
and we'd like this like Tim once you go

1352
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,369
around there and sit it looks like it's

1353
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:58,930
gonna take you a while so he's sitting

1354
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:02,019
behind the desk next to the guard

1355
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:05,828
putting these on top of his clipboard

1356
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:08,439
cloner yeah she didn't say anything he

1357
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:10,690
would pull one out and it's plastic and

1358
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,579
so the cards plastic ins to read it he

1359
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,049
would lay it on there and like kind of

1360
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:16,390
go everybody knows like reading you know

1361
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:18,579
making it always like and she never

1362
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,960
thought okay why is this guy rubbing all

1363
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:22,359
the cars on his clipboard and then

1364
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,220
putting him back in just to like this

1365
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:26,500
lady was super nice so she had a picture

1366
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:28,269
of her daughter or granddaughter playing

1367
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,220
soccer and Brett began to talk to her

1368
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:31,779
about you know the soccer game and their

1369
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,058
kids and stuff and while they did I said

1370
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:37,240
hey I'm doing a network assessment test

1371
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:38,890
I just need to get access to your system

1372
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,419
to the locker system I plugged in a key

1373
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,830
logger then I said actually you know I

1374
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,330
need to check one thing could you log

1375
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:44,799
back in and then she logged back in

1376
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,569
that's okay thanks I'm Brent the

1377
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,490
continues talking to her and now I've

1378
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:50,530
got her domain username password and

1379
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,910
then I was like all right I think we're

1380
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:54,340
wrapped up I need to get your name first

1381
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,810
cuz your name if your name spelt weird I

1382
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,340
was like can I see your badge so I can

1383
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,960
write it down because it was a long name

1384
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,700
it was a mouthful she was a girl sure

1385
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,480
gave me her badge and we cloned your

1386
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:06,220
badge and wrote it down I felt so awful

1387
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,500
because he said he felt so bad after

1388
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:12,089
that he was like man I feel like I got a

1389
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:15,270
fun girl voice I apologized to her so I

1390
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,270
don't care

1391
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:21,550
Tim's a jerk yeah clean desk policy

1392
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,270
again into some things Jason talked

1393
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:27,600
about earlier you don't very high

1394
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:29,530
password management is not a post-it so

1395
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,270
well you do the security awareness

1396
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:35,470
training if you do if you lead your

1397
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:37,930
security by checkbox you're doing it

1398
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:39,129
wrong stop just because you want to be

1399
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,440
compliant doesn't mean that you're

1400
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,000
secure just because you've met some

1401
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,430
standards doesn't mean you're secure

1402
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,190
just because you do a annual security

1403
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:50,859
awareness training with a few questions

1404
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:53,020
at the end of your fancy slideshow

1405
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:54,220
doesn't mean you're secure and it

1406
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,509
certainly doesn't mean that the

1407
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,950
employees that are taking that are going

1408
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,510
to retain that information and apply it

1409
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:01,390
so this is where security culture needs

1410
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,619
to take place and it needs to over take

1411
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:05,618
precedence over security we're answering

1412
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:06,940
now check check box security that's a

1413
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:09,640
good baseline to get start

1414
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:12,609
you obviously need that but consider

1415
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,299
real-world scenarios actually push it to

1416
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:18,250
the limits put more budget to that so

1417
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,630
this is this is from Google but you'd be

1418
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:23,590
surprised how many times we've seen

1419
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:25,840
really stupid stuff like this you know

1420
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:27,100
