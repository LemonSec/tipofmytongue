1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
started welcomes they'd be enjoying no

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:12,509
Lacan so far I am to thank you for

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,420
coming this afternoon to hear more tales

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,520
from the crypt analysts my name is jeff

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,170
man I am a senior information security

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,330
consultant at a company called online

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,820
business systems there's my contact info

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,400
feel free to reach out to me Twitter

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,869
email somebody did actually call me a

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,538
couple weeks ago which was weird because

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,969
people don't do that anymore so I feel

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,000
safe putting my number up there very

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,590
briefly because my company like pays my

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,120
way to come speak at conferences just

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,530
want to give a quick shout out to them

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,870
its company called online business

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,070
systems which nobody's ever heard of

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,690
it's a 30 year old company mostly doing

19
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,550
consulting IT services but we have a

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,890
security practice that started about six

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,809
years ago and it's ashli two people that

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,149
I used to work with a long time ago and

23
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,129
I'm back back with them again and

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,260
because they know me they let me come

25
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,500
out and do this speaking so thanks a lot

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,850
to my company online business systems

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:10,110
I've been in the information security

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,030
business for about I 35 36 37 years it

29
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,460
depends when you count it as it started

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,220
my first job in the government was in

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,830
1984 so technically it's been about 35

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,770
years but I used to have a job doing

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,080
loans skip-tracing in college which kind

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,470
of taught me Osen skills so I kind of go

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,780
back 37 years I do want to apologize

36
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,579
right off the bat in putting together

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,470
this presentation which is really a

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,809
story about the last couple years that I

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,329
was at the National Security Agency I

40
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,220
very quickly realized that you know

41
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,960
finding screenshots was going to be a

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,750
little bit problematic because that's

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,320
how we did screenshots back 25 26 years

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,810
ago so I tried my best to find

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,479
meaningful graphics to you know work

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,659
with the talk but you know bear with me

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,689
the technology's come a long way I'm

48
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,030
going to try to infuse throughout the

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,339
talk and especially to get you guys to

50
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,810
interact with me a little bit every once

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,598
in a while there's going to be dates pop

52
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,360
up and when the day pops up what I am

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,130
hoping to do is ask people

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,900
you know what is the significance of the

55
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,359
date so let's do a trial run real quick

56
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,570
does anybody know the significance of

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,480
this date in history you know shout it

58
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:33,600
out if you want to guess shout it out

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:35,670
anyone give up if you don't know what

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,380
that means you're just gonna have to

61
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,010
wonder for a while or google it while

62
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,850
you're listening to me talk so anyway I

63
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:49,049
was at NSA from 1986 to 1996 for about

64
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:52,920
10 years in that time I did a number of

65
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,090
different things primarily or the most

66
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,160
of the time I was there as a

67
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,500
cryptologist and I worked on both sides

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,200
both both the defensive side which we

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,060
called InfoSec back in those days as

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,489
well as on the operations of the

71
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,700
offensive side so I technically was a

72
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,010
Crypt analyst and a cryptologist or a

73
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,170
cryptographer which means I designed

74
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,170
codes and ciphers and I also tried to

75
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,600
break codes and ciphers and I also then

76
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,390
later on got into the things that we're

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,209
going to talk about today a couple years

78
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,600
ago I had I had met somebody at a

79
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,100
conference and at a speaker dinner night

80
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,450
before the conference went to his taught

81
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,549
the next day and it turned out he was

82
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,429
giving a talk on sort of the history of

83
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,900
cryptography or cryptography 101 and the

84
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,310
thought occurred to me is like wow I

85
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,040
know everything he's talking about

86
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,400
I used to do that stuff so I thought I

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,049
would put together a talk and turned it

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,880
into a talk originally that was called

89
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,830
Tales from the Crypt analyst which I

90
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,359
have stickers if you haven't gotten a

91
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,610
sticker already there's some up here

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,350
because I worked for a company at the

93
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,670
time that had a graphics department and

94
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,739
I talked them into making this cool

95
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,609
graphic that's supposed to look like the

96
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,260
old comic book in that I spoke mostly

97
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,450
about the first six or seven years that

98
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,459
I was at NSA and I always promised the

99
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,530
sequel which was what we're going to be

100
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,650
doing today you know so more of Tales

101
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,420
from the Crypt analysts just very

102
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,579
briefly I don't know if you've heard my

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,459
original talk or not that I wanted to

104
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,140
share just a couple things that sort of

105
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,739
fit into the the topic of our discussion

106
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,039
today

107
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,960
I was sort of started out in what was

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,200
called the manual cryptosystems branch

109
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,940
on the InfoSec side of NSA we produce

110
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,039
things like one-time pads which is

111
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,480
what's up there on the left the one-time

112
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,970
pad is the most secure system available

113
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,280
for protecting secrets that has ever

114
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,530
been invented because it's not breakable

115
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,869
if you use it correctly which you know

116
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,539
as the name implies use the key one time

117
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,400
it simply can't be broken unlike

118
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,230
everything we use today even though it

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
might take tens of thousands or millions

120
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,500
of years there's still the possibility

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,010
of brute forcing and getting to that

122
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,980
solution not so with the one-time pad

123
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,599
one of the first assignments I had was I

124
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,100
had a customer that came to me and said

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,330
we're using these one-time pads and

126
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,950
they're a real pain in the ass because

127
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,140
it takes us hours to write out the

128
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,960
messages and do the encryption but we

129
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,300
got this thing on our desk called a PC

130
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,770
is there any way we could use that to do

131
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,110
the encryption I thought well yeah that

132
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,580
makes sense it's not a complicated

133
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,310
algorithm it's just a matter of getting

134
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,070
the key in electronic form so I ended up

135
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,810
you know designing a system where on one

136
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,030
end it was still paper on the other end

137
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,030
it was the one time pad key on a floppy

138
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,460
disk and we produced this system that

139
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,900
was semi automated one-time pad to my

140
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,090
knowledge and I haven't found anybody

141
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,440
that has come up with anything else this

142
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,299
was the first software based

143
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,610
cryptographic system that NSA ever

144
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,360
produced might have been the last but it

145
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,730
was certainly the first in doing that

146
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,210
and this sort of ties into some of the

147
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,130
hacker methodology or hacker mentality

148
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,039
that I didn't realize at the time that I

149
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,810
had but I basically was working for an

150
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,840
engineering organization that built

151
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,810
little black boxes and in fact that I

152
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,460
had a chief scientist back at the time

153
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,020
say something about well you know

154
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,030
there's really no such thing as software

155
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,419
it's all hardware because that's all

156
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,400
that we did and so I had design specs

157
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,140
and there was a process that you had to

158
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,260
go through in order to produce a new

159
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,550
system you had to come up you had to

160
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,380
follow all these specs that were written

161
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,180
for hardware so I sort of had to hack

162
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,419
the specs and rewrite them to make them

163
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,279
make sense for software and I had to

164
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,929
sort of present the the concept to

165
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,869
you know essentially the Board of

166
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:44,808
Directors all the senior management

167
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:47,569
within the InfoSec side of NSA I was a

168
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:48,529
young guy in my early 20s let's say

169
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,829
mid-20s

170
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:54,019
you know months on the job and meeting a

171
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:56,059
bunch of old guys that were in suits and

172
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:58,429
they were all scientists and engineers

173
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,859
and they spoke a different language and

174
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:02,359
they were very serious and I had to

175
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:04,998
basically convince them to do something

176
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:07,998
that had never been done before and this

177
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:10,759
is actually a obviously it's a Calvin

178
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:13,519
and Hobbes cartoon that I redrew using

179
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,919
some basically what would be considered

180
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,319
today paint so I just kind of hand drew

181
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,899
this copying a Calvin and Hobbes which

182
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,179
is no big deal other than it just sort

183
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,639
of talks about the fact that I I had to

184
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:27,888
rewrite the specs and in doing that I I

185
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,079
sort of broke a lot of rules when I

186
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,429
actually got the system fielded the the

187
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,049
management said well you met all the

188
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:37,429
requirements you did what she asked us

189
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:40,308
to do but please don't do this again one

190
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:42,619
of the other things I did one of my

191
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:45,529
customers was the US Special Forces and

192
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:47,839
in working with them they used one-time

193
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,689
pads the algorithm that they used was

194
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,159
based on this table on the left which is

195
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:53,929
called a Visionnaire square or

196
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,449
Visionnaire table which is an offset of

197
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:58,188
the alphabet 26 different offsets so

198
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:01,610
you're familiar with Caesar cipher which

199
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:04,699
is a single offset this is a combination

200
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,939
of 26 different offsets in working with

201
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,919
that it basically produces unique

202
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,289
three-letter combinations and that was

203
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,329
essentially the algorithm the Special

204
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,188
Forces would memorize it I was working

205
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:18,679
with them and didn't have it memorized

206
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,029
so I was fumbling with the table but I'd

207
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,828
just been through a bunch of a history

208
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,209
of cryptography classes and learned

209
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:24,349
about cipher wheels and I thought you

210
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,539
know there ought to be a way to come up

211
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,399
with a cipher wheel that does the

212
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,789
Visionaire square so I came up with it

213
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,490
and I was just using it for myself to

214
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,129
make a long story short they liked it so

215
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,990
much that we ended up producing like

216
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:41,750
15,000 of them and distributed to US

217
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,579
Special Forces I bring this up and just

218
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,809
sort of this isn't the main topic but

219
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:47,359
it's kind of a neat thing that just

220
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:49,459
happened a month or so ago I was at

221
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,520
cipher County Milwaukee and a buddy of

222
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,770
mine came up to me

223
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,480
he knows I was a crypto guy at NSA and

224
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,720
he asked me if I'd ever heard of this

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,580
thing called the Diana crypto system

226
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,020
that was used by Special Forces I said

227
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,120
well that doesn't sound familiar so I

228
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,310
googled it and I came up with this page

229
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,700
some guys making him out of wood and

230
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,170
when the guy when I saw this I asked my

231
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,080
friend I said does that look like this

232
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,060
other do you know go back does it look

233
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,050
like that thing and he said yeah I said

234
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,319
well that's because you're talking to

235
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,150
the inventor but the guy that made these

236
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,890
things he was approached by an

237
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,860
instructor who was apparently ex-special

238
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:28,319
forces at the military War College and I

239
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,030
think it's Carlisle Pennsylvania and had

240
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,380
given him a bunch of information on the

241
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,230
history because he wanted to preserve

242
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,610
the history there was an email on there

243
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,770
and I got in touch with the guy and I

244
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,900
just said that Diana cryptosystem I

245
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,760
invented it wanna chat by the next

246
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,770
morning I had an email back from the guy

247
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,700
so we've exchanged a couple emails long

248
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,130
in the short of it

249
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,420
he sent me one of them so if you want to

250
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,480
see it afterwards you can come up and

251
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,250
look at it the reason and he was calling

252
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
it Diana cryptosystem and it took me a

253
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,780
little while to remember it's because

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
all the crypto that we produced at NSA

255
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,430
had a had a sort of a serial number it

256
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,830
had a registration you know sort of code

257
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,689
of what it technically was but there was

258
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,620
also a code name just for short and

259
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,090
paper systems were traditionally named

260
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,160
according to Greek mythology and I

261
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,570
remembered after you know looking at

262
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,400
this that the one-time Bad's that

263
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,560
special forces used were actually called

264
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,060
diana one-time pads that's where the

265
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,189
diana came from that was like the first

266
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,560
question that the guy had is why he call

267
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,450
it Diana well that's why he actually

268
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,560
sent me a whole bunch of puzzles this

269
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:34,350
guy makes crypto puzzles and and he

270
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,329
tries to replicate crypto cryptographic

271
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,180
items and he does it in wood it's kind

272
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,010
of cool if you google Diana cryptosystem

273
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,209
you'll find this guy if you want to pick

274
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,890
up some of these things they're kind of

275
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:48,300
neat my goal and that this is actually a

276
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,610
picture that I found actually the guy

277
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,339
that had approached me had found on

278
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,840
Pinterest of all things and that's

279
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,690
actually a production model of this

280
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,510
thing that I learned that Special Forces

281
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:04,660
came to call the whizz wheel anyway I

282
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:06,939
got a cache Ward for it and my boss

283
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,790
who considered me a loose cannon because

284
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,430
I did that other thing when I was

285
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,339
written up for this the the abstract of

286
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:18,370
my award it was titled man reinvents

287
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,810
wheel I've actually had submitted a FOIA

288
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,460
request because I would love to get a

289
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,430
copy of that I don't know if it exists

290
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,830
or not second part of my NSA career

291
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,750
which would be much quicker I was on the

292
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,490
ops side so I was breaking codes I was

293
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,830
there during Desert Shield Desert Storm

294
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,120
and I was down in the buildings that

295
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,810
you're more familiar with if you have

296
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,210
ever seen an aerial photograph my one

297
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,630
certification is I'm certified as a

298
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:46,390
Crypt analyst from the NSA and that

299
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,970
leads us up into what I call chapter

300
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,819
three or part three of the NSA career

301
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,650
which is when I went back to the InfoSec

302
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,000
side which was actually technically my

303
00:11:53,650 --> 00:12:00,069
last tour as a crypt analysis intern I

304
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,280
went to work for this group that was

305
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:07,570
called fielded systems evaluations and

306
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,990
the idea was simply NSA sort of made its

307
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:14,260
living taking advantage of our

308
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,030
adversaries sort of misusing the systems

309
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,290
they would do things like not change

310
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,560
default settings

311
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,270
they wouldn't change keys as frequently

312
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,209
as they were supposed to you're like the

313
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,880
one time one time key the one-time pads

314
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:30,160
I guess to try to save paper sometimes

315
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,500
they might use it for a week or maybe

316
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,300
thirty days or something like that when

317
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,690
you do that you introduce cryptographic

318
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:41,229
vulnerabilities to make the messages

319
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:43,450
breakable so somebody have the great

320
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,070
ideas you know we we produced the best

321
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,960
little boxes and the best cryptographic

322
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,270
systems in the world but how do we know

323
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,670
our own people use them correctly so we

324
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,780
had this office that did fielded systems

325
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,610
evaluations of our own systems this is

326
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,380
one of the devices that I worked on this

327
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,640
is a I don't know if anybody's in the

328
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,080
military's ever use this but this was a

329
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,660
device that would take a voice and

330
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,390
digitize it and then encrypt the digital

331
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,610
stream send it to the other end decrypt

332
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,610
it and hopefully take the digital back

333
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,780
to analog so you could hear the voice

334
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,580
usually it made you sound like Donald

335
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,050
Duck

336
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,580
if anybody's ever used one of these it

337
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,020
was it wasn't perfect but you usually

338
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:27,720
got the messages so here's another date

339
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:31,050
anybody know what this date is this date

340
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,250
really changed history and this date is

341
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:38,069
really why we're all here

342
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:40,320
anybody ever guess not a clue this is

343
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,200
the date that not the first web browser

344
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,090
but the basically the first commercially

345
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
available web browser was released to

346
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,570
the public

347
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,370
it was a browser called mosaic and like

348
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,790
I said rudimentary but this is what it

349
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,920
looked like this is what got everybody

350
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,780
interested in the internet and doing

351
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,610
everything on the Internet it got it's

352
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,420
what got us all online the internet

353
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,720
existed before that but this is what

354
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:12,150
changed thing a combination of this and

355
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:14,400
this back in those days and I'm talking

356
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,850
you know obviously 1993 and I was in

357
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,209
this office at the time we had reference

358
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,860
materials and if you notice back then

359
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,930
everything was all internet security

360
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,030
because it was all about how do we take

361
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:31,260
our existing computers and networks and

362
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:33,870
tap into this global bat backbone that's

363
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,400
called the Internet so these are some of

364
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,440
the books that I use this sort of

365
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,439
reference materials back in the day

366
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:45,600
within the fielded systems evaluation

367
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,480
branch I was in a little subgroup that

368
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,300
was focused on network systems and back

369
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,810
before the internet was a thing at least

370
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,420
you know in terms of web browsing what

371
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,300
was mostly connected to each other on

372
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,339
the internet was universities and

373
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:06,000
research organizations mostly with

374
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,830
mainframes and and most of the

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,100
information that was available was on

376
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:13,290
databases and it was it was very

377
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,610
rudimentary and it wasn't very easy to

378
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:19,770
get to you but hacking was a thing

379
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:24,150
anybody ever read this book or heard of

380
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,740
this book this is actually a very

381
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,780
inspirational book and it was a book

382
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,110
that was inspirational to us back in our

383
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,390
office and I bring this up because I

384
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,130
had few fanboy moments but about a month

385
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,990
ago I was at a conference where there's

386
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,860
gentleman that wrote this book named

387
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,120
cliff Stoll he was actually the keynote

388
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,000
basically what happened to him was and

389
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:49,829
this was back and I think 1986 he was an

390
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,589
astronomer astronomer and I think it was

391
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:54,689
at Berkeley I might get the the details

392
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:56,610
wrong but basically back in those days

393
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,160
you had to pay for your time

394
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,450
on the mainframe and so his group you

395
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,769
know he was going through the bill that

396
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,630
he had gotten for like the monthly

397
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,850
charges for doing work on the mainframe

398
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,100
and he noticed something like a 70 cent

399
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,410
discrepancy something really small and

400
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,230
in digging up why is there this

401
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,300
discrepancy he slowly realized that

402
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,300
their mainframe had been a attacked

403
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,370
there was somebody on it and you know

404
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,740
nothing like forensics existed back then

405
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,630
there was very little known about

406
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,490
computer hacking in any way shape or

407
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,189
form and he kind of took it upon itself

408
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,970
to figure out you know what had happened

409
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,140
long story short it was tied back to

410
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,720
back in those days it was the Soviet

411
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,399
Union and it was spies it was breaking

412
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,870
into the university computers because

413
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
what's a lot of the research they did at

414
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,690
that time government stuff DoD stuff

415
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,130
military stuff anyway I bring this up

416
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,750
because I got a chance to meet the guy

417
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,990
so that's me getting the picture a

418
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:58,110
picture with cliff Stoll just about a

419
00:16:51,990 --> 00:17:00,000
month ago anyway so our branch the this

420
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,300
the couple group guys that I worked with

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,750
we started learning about hacking what

422
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,589
what little there was and and we started

423
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:13,230
applying that to the network systems and

424
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,000
of course you know hacking started to

425
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,599
become sort of popular more well-known

426
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,400
and management as it were they decided

427
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,010
to take over you know if anybody's ever

428
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,350
worked for a bureaucracy but you know

429
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,319
management has a way of reorganizing

430
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:31,469
especially in the DoD so they in a short

431
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,480
amount of time reorganized us into what

432
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,380
was called a Center of Excellence known

433
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,330
as the systems and network attack center

434
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,250
the purpose of the system and network

435
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,330
attack center as I said was to be the

436
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,550
center of excellence and

437
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,990
the group that I was involved with you

438
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,610
know focused on networks we were

439
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,530
essentially learning how to hack

440
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,530
computers learning how to hack networks

441
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,910
and that's kind of what we focused on we

442
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,190
didn't have a lot to work with there

443
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,080
there wasn't lots of conferences to go

444
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,370
to there weren't training courses there

445
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,379
weren't certifications there weren't

446
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,510
even really documented methodologies we

447
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:10,910
were just kind of coming up with it as

448
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:13,220
we went along we put a team together the

449
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,840
the deputy director at the time his

450
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,150
vision was we need as a bunch of those

451
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,470
long hair you know really smart kids and

452
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,330
we'll get a bunch of that and we'll beat

453
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,220
the world and of course as you know

454
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,379
hopefully you know when there's

455
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,790
thousands if not millions of people that

456
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,240
are out there doing the same kind of

457
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,770
thing know one small set of people no

458
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,150
matter how good they are is going to be

459
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:36,889
able to compete against the world so

460
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,100
even in the very early stages we were

461
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,420
sort of running into the the political

462
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,010
bureaucratic well this is what we want

463
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,220
you to do versus what we were learning

464
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,270
about in terms of hacking and and and

465
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,550
what we thought was the hacker

466
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,889
methodology or the hacker mentality and

467
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,870
how do you do this thing called we

468
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:57,310
called it ethical hacking back then we

469
00:18:53,870 --> 00:19:01,669
called it pentesting penetration testing

470
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:03,560
at the time the Air Force basically

471
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,120
owned the network yeah I don't know if

472
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,980
they still do or not but back then they

473
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,709
did at least and they were sort of ahead

474
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,960
of the of everybody else in terms of

475
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,090
they had a Network Operations Center and

476
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,770
they were the first at least DoD

477
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,230
organization to set up a security

478
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,150
operation center so they they knew what

479
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,760
they were doing so we went on a field

480
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,220
trip to learn about what they were doing

481
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,590
because you know resources were scarce

482
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,090
there wasn't a lot of there wasn't a lot

483
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,240
to go to but we knew that they were

484
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,800
doing stuff so we went to visit them we

485
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,180
met a couple guys that were Air Force

486
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,800
captains gentleman on the left captain's

487
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,950
eyes gentleman on the right right

488
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,690
captain Liddell captain's eyes on the

489
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,270
left he unfortunately passed away about

490
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,890
two years ago now I think the guy on the

491
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,930
right captain Waddell I actually found

492
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,310
him on LinkedIn and actually as I was

493
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,440
putting this talk together had a chance

494
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,960
to get on the phone with

495
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,730
you know reminisce cuz we went to visit

496
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,280
them and then later on they came to

497
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,600
visit us if you're older you may

498
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,330
remember one of the first security

499
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,340
companies that was formed was a company

500
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,280
called Wheel group and like any good

501
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,939
security company after about 1215 months

502
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,680
that got acquired by Cisco Cisco has

503
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,360
been acquiring security companies ever

504
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,280
since and people still don't think of

505
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,120
Cisco as a security company but that's

506
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,830
another talk for another day we we took

507
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,620
a trip they were located in San Antonio

508
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,199
and one of the cool things about being

509
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:32,530
in San Antonio is they had this sort of

510
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,110
Air Force Museum as it were that was the

511
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,570
YouTube spy plane it had only recently

512
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,919
been sort of declassified so that you

513
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,300
could actually go out and look at one

514
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:45,640
the a-10 warthog that was a plan that

515
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,530
was instrumental in in winning the the

516
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,290
first skirmish in the desert Desert

517
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,940
Storm those guys in the picture there

518
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,590
are actually people that I used to work

519
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,170
with its small enough hopefully that

520
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,959
they're not identifiable plus it was

521
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,940
about 24 years ago so we've changed a

522
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,680
little bit of course we did all the cool

523
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,350
stuff at the alla' you know in San

524
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,570
Antonio like visit the Alamo we done to

525
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,860
the river Riverwalk and that's where we

526
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,530
discovered which is probably one of the

527
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:16,899
most important aspects of hacking trust

528
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:18,520
me the 46 ounce margarita we only had

529
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,280
one drink that night so you can't say we

530
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,300
didn't over over drink but it did most

531
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,190
of us in our biggest takeaway really

532
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,120
from San Antonio was sort of the way

533
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,800
that they operated in terms of the team

534
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,179
back in those days it was very common to

535
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,250
have cubicles and have everybody

536
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,500
isolated in their physical office space

537
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,000
but what they had done they had pushed

538
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,640
all the desks to the corners of the

539
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,920
space and literally put a round table in

540
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,300
the middle of their space and if

541
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,220
somebody was working on a research

542
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,240
project or somebody had a question or

543
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,550
somebody would just wanted to bounce

544
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,500
ideas off of everybody else they would

545
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,669
call round tables spin the chairs and

546
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,970
everybody would come to the middle and

547
00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:00,250
huddle up so we adopted that so in

548
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,860
forming this thing called the snack they

549
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,780
moved us to a new building and they put

550
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,729
us in an office and we designed our

551
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,639
office much like this so we had we

552
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,890
a bigger roundtable like I said was hard

553
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,200
to find graphics that fit this talk but

554
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:18,760
it's best I could do our office we

555
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,370
nickname because we were trying to be

556
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,240
cool hacker kids we nicknamed it the pit

557
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,100
and the pit is a is an office that

558
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,040
exists this is buildings that are

559
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,649
outside of the BWI Airport in Maryland

560
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,750
and the pit was actually an office that

561
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,340
was in this building here and pretty

562
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,309
much in that corner of the building I

563
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,809
bring that up because a couple years ago

564
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:42,639
there's a book came out called dark

565
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,820
territories anybody seen this book read

566
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,520
this book a couple people in this book

567
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,950
in the fourth chapter which is titled

568
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,870
eligible receiver there's this following

569
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,410
paragraph and and I like to read

570
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,120
dramatically to you if you allow me in

571
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,070
the middle of kinda it says during its

572
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,590
most sensitive drills the red team

573
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,320
worked out of a chamber called the pit

574
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,299
which was so secret that few people at

575
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,610
NSA knew it existed and even they

576
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:13,230
couldn't enter without first passing

577
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:16,299
through to combination lock doors so

578
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:19,210
somehow the first group of people that

579
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:21,879
were doing pen testing and and learning

580
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,130
how to do red teaming at NSA and we were

581
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,650
just a bunch of guys working together

582
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:30,040
trying to learn this this this hacker

583
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,900
craft and we called our office the pit

584
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,730
somehow that transcended in the folklore

585
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:38,380
they made it into a book so we've got

586
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:41,320
our little 15 minutes of fame there go

587
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,000
hooah now at that point it was exciting

588
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,159
because the when the book came out one

589
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,510
of the members of the pit got a copy of

590
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,549
the book and when he read that paragraph

591
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,110
he took pictures of it and emailed it to

592
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,668
all of us and said guys we're in a book

593
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,540
we're in a book was very exciting for us

594
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:57,520
but to move on because methodologies

595
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:02,290
didn't exist we worked on developing a

596
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,660
methodology we we had to sort of work

597
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,210
within we were basically an unchartered

598
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,610
territory the the existing rules of

599
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,440
engagement didn't really apply so we

600
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,928
were sort of pressing the envelope as a

601
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,960
good hacker would you wouldn't stay

602
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:19,399
within the boundaries one of the most

603
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,359
important rules was that we

604
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:27,738
came to learn later on sort of twofold

605
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:30,949
one was there's this thing called the

606
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:32,570
NSA Charter and the NSS NSA Charter

607
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,039
which is still classified so I can't

608
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:37,759
kind of quote it to you but it basically

609
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:40,070
says NSA should only do what NSA does to

610
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,979
our two foreign entities and as they

611
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:47,408
should not do what NSA does to u.s.

612
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:51,080
citizens we can talk about Snowden later

613
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:53,539
but in combination with that what we

614
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,428
were really really were encountering

615
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,259
more on a day to day basis was the

616
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:59,210
bureaucracy of well if you're gonna do

617
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,710
all these attacks and everything you

618
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,679
need to have permission to do it and

619
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,989
permission in a bureaucracy means lots

620
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,789
and lots of levels of Management having

621
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:09,349
a say which means you know it was paper

622
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,359
back in those days we'd have to write up

623
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:13,428
what we were going to do and it had to

624
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,249
be signed off by all sorts of levels of

625
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,799
Management and all the way up to the

626
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:20,899
Deputy Director and which man had had to

627
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,849
be passed from desk to desk to DES and

628
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:25,728
would sit on the desks for days if not

629
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:27,649
weeks where very often it might be a

630
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:29,059
month before we got permission to do

631
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:30,619
what we wanted to do of course where

632
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,999
hackers we knew what we were going to do

633
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:34,009
we knew it was going to work and we

634
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:38,960
wanted to do it right away so that was

635
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:41,179
very frustrating but you know we

636
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,769
gradually came up with a methodology and

637
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,960
it shouldn't come as a surprise to you

638
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:47,330
it's it's fairly similar to what we use

639
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,759
today in terms of methodology we call

640
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,978
things different things these days but

641
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,749
you know essentially we started out by

642
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:55,999
doing what we call the reconnaissance or

643
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:58,489
recon because there's a military term or

644
00:25:55,999 --> 00:26:00,229
a military organization you know find

645
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:02,179
your target determine what your target

646
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:04,999
environment is you know which was a

647
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,799
network segment or a you know a Class C

648
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:08,779
Network or something like that and

649
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,908
figure out what was on it you know doing

650
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:13,519
things that we now know of in terms of

651
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:17,359
you know we use nmap these days and map

652
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,279
didn't actually exist back then you know

653
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,049
identify our targets find out what

654
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,059
they're talking and what what ports and

655
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:25,849
services are open figure out our attack

656
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:28,039
strategies do the attacks write it up

657
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:29,779
not a whole lot different from what we

658
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,210
do today except for we had to figure

659
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:32,740
this out because nobody

660
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:36,640
never done it before at least not within

661
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:39,220
our organization I want to show you yeah

662
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,380
I mentioned nmap we didn't have I tried

663
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,970
to write down some of the things that I

664
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,010
know of that are common tools these days

665
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,630
just to sort of you know help to

666
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,908
illustrate what we were working with

667
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:52,000
back then you know basically we had to

668
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:54,429
hack you know uphill ten miles both

669
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,529
directions and the snow type of thing a

670
00:26:54,429 --> 00:27:00,010
lot of the things that are taken for

671
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:01,720
granted these days in terms of tools we

672
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,179
just didn't have or we had very

673
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,590
rudimentary versions of what now are

674
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:10,059
these tools I even put that in the slide

675
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,820
about going uphill in the snow look at

676
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:14,590
that so what did we have I want to talk

677
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,120
a little bit about the tradecraft and

678
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,908
and this is where it gets a little bit

679
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,549
tricky so I sort of tongue-in-cheek

680
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:23,500
I gave this this talk at besides

681
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:25,149
Baltimore a couple weeks ago there's a

682
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,890
kid in the audience that got freaked out

683
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:28,629
because he thought I was about to you

684
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,990
know divulge a bunch of secrets but bear

685
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,450
with me the the problem we had was when

686
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:37,450
we as NSA were targeting a system

687
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,120
anything that we did to try to target

688
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,429
that system had to be classified at the

689
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,189
level of the system that we were

690
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:47,320
targeting which kind of makes sense sort

691
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,899
of but if we were going after a

692
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,620
top-secret Network anything we did was

693
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:53,620
top-secret

694
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,830
so in sharing with you what some of the

695
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,239
things that were available back then

696
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,070
might have been what would be might have

697
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,440
been what we were using I'm not saying

698
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,360
we did use it I'm just saying this is

699
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,510
what was available at the time there's

700
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,379
no wink wink your with okay so we had

701
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:14,140
network sniffers they were devices they

702
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,940
weighed 30 or 40 pounds and we had them

703
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,490
on carts and would wheel them around to

704
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,279
plug him into the network equipment in

705
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,799
big machine rooms and data data centers

706
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,190
so those are the things that we had in

707
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:30,190
terms of network sniffers we did have

708
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,020
access to you know what now would be

709
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,120
considered a vulnerability assessment

710
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,250
tools and I remember Satan anybody ever

711
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,559
heard of Satan this is one of the first

712
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,870
tools this and another tool called ISS

713
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,789
internet security scanner were sort of

714
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,510
the first vulnerability scanning tools

715
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,610
that were made

716
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:50,800
available open source tools even back

717
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:53,649
then I'll mention it later but I do a

718
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,659
security webcast called Paul security

719
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,930
weekly and we actually had a chance to

720
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,150
interview the authors of Satan last

721
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,790
November I think it was feats of enema

722
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:07,570
and Dan farmer I actually coincidentally

723
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:09,100
met Dan farmer for the first time don't

724
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,840
even ask me what year it was but it was

725
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,780
here in New Orleans I spent an evening

726
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,810
with man farmer on Bourbon Street that's

727
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,550
a story for a bar sometime Dan way I got

728
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,460
a chance to meet these so another fanboy

729
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:24,669
moment I've had in the last year so

730
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:27,270
another date anyone I'm gonna go quickly

731
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:30,220
because nobody's guessing at all

732
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:32,680
November 5th 1993 is word and something

733
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,790
called bug Trac came out bug track back

734
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,770
in the day was sort of a digest I think

735
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,480
essentially was an email list where

736
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,860
people would talk about vulnerabilities

737
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,390
that they discovered so when you were

738
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,790
trying to track vulnerabilities back

739
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,200
then one of the best sources was to go

740
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,840
to bug track and search to see if

741
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,280
anybody's talking about XYZ that you're

742
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,139
using and have had they had have they

743
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,270
had any problems with it how have they

744
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,130
fixed the problems and a lot of it was

745
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,540
just more focused on troubleshooting and

746
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,290
trying to make things work but it was a

747
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,490
wealth of information for learning about

748
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:05,139
targets and what they might be using

749
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,140
what they might be having difficulties

750
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,170
with and so on so forth so bug track was

751
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,930
one of those cool tools that we had this

752
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,730
is an example of what a bug track

753
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,220
write-up was if somebody would basically

754
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,720
write an email and it was organized in

755
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,700
such a way that if you replied to the

756
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,550
email it would sort of keep a digest so

757
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,130
in very rudimentary but you can kind of

758
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:29,200
sort of search it there were several

759
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,590
many people over the years that took bug

760
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,320
track and put it into a more digestible

761
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,810
searchable form but this is what we had

762
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,399
to work with back then there was

763
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,500
organizations like cert

764
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,380
computer emergency response teams there

765
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,690
was various ones they would put out

766
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,100
notifications of incidents and you know

767
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,900
either vulnerabilities that were

768
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,750
discovered most of the time it was

769
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:55,420
hackers doing their thing that was that

770
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,400
was being discovered

771
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,200
you probably couldn't read it's because

772
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,760
it's the small print this was a real

773
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,150
certain visor II that was put out on

774
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,400
July 4th 19 1996 which was the release

775
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,920
of a movie called Independence Day that

776
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,980
talked about the the vulnerabilities

777
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,660
associated with alien operating systems

778
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,360
so it was kind of a tongue-in-cheek

779
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,900
thing but we you know we had senses of

780
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,270
humor back then we did things what's

781
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,610
called ascent these days we call it kind

782
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:27,450
of open source again we mostly call it a

783
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:30,939
recon there are rudimentary searchable

784
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:33,520
databases or rudimental rudimentary

785
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,049
search tools that were used to tap into

786
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,530
what was mostly these mainframe

787
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:42,429
databases things like archie things like

788
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:45,879
gopher if you wanted to look up you know

789
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:48,190
what at IP addresses or network spaces

790
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,990
of organizations of your target you

791
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,549
could go to places and look them up back

792
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,799
in those days we didn't have private

793
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:56,379
address and everything had a publicly

794
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,970
addressable address so you you'd buy a

795
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,540
chunk you buy a class-c

796
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:04,059
buy a piece of a Class C which is 256

797
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,220
255 addresses and you have to register

798
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:09,389
your domain so a lot of information was

799
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,390
sort of out there freely available

800
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,910
gopher is another search engine before

801
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,809
Google there was a kickass search engine

802
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,210
called Alta Vista

803
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:23,700
I remember Alta Vista lots of thing is

804
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:27,490
there that was our go-to search engine

805
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,500
and of course there was Netscape you

806
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:33,370
know just the regular type of web

807
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,020
browsing the original Yahoo they may

808
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,899
remember the original Yahoo I should

809
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:40,210
have found a screenshot when you when yo

810
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,309
who first came out one of the features

811
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,200
on the first page of Yahoo was sort of

812
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,910
what they called roulette you could

813
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,590
click on it and would just take you to a

814
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,880
random website because back in those

815
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,250
days there was only like a hundred

816
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,990
websites and you know they wanted you to

817
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,830
experience the Internet so they would

818
00:32:52,990 --> 00:33:00,700
just let you go out to random place we

819
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:04,149
did target acquisition before nmap there

820
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:08,090
was a program called strobe strobe did

821
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:10,100
TCP port scanning primarily as I

822
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,480
doing this talk and I was looking up you

823
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,158
know when did things come out because I

824
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,520
wanted to make sure I was being accurate

825
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:18,260
I I had the interesting discovery and

826
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,809
I'll ask it in the form of a trivia

827
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:25,340
question

828
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:27,350
anybody know who wrote stroke Assange

829
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,658
Julian Assange I looked at I was like

830
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,059
that's why I know the guys name when you

831
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:34,070
used to launch straw Stroeve it would it

832
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:35,928
would come up in a shell it would scroll

833
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,730
up and say this is stro version whatever

834
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:42,350
written by Julian Assange like I always

835
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:44,059
knew his name sounded familiar I can't

836
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,789
read what that was it's another search

837
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:49,370
engine nslookup it was a way to look up

838
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:52,820
addresses the names of systems the IP

839
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:56,539
addresses of systems we had rudimentary

840
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:59,270
network mapping tools open another date

841
00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:02,559
anyone I got a speeded-up here I think

842
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:06,799
I'm blathering too much I'm doing okay

843
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:11,839
crack one of the first password cracking

844
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,550
tools actually I found not too long ago

845
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,659
on YouTube like in the last week or two

846
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:19,609
apparently Alec Moffat did a

847
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,770
presentation somewhere where he kind of

848
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:23,659
talked about the history of an evolution

849
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,929
of crack very interesting if you if you

850
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:29,179
search I should update this and get the

851
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:31,099
link but Alec mafia talking about the

852
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,099
history of crack it's like a 45 minute

853
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:37,159
presentation really cool back in those

854
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:39,649
days it was all UNIX systems passwords

855
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,270
were contained as hashes and what was

856
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:42,770
called the Etsy password file they

857
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,500
weren't hidden they weren't protected in

858
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:47,629
other files they were pretty much and

859
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,369
this was a world readable file so

860
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:51,080
anybody that was on the system could

861
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:53,179
look at this file and of course you

862
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,220
could grab the hashes and try to break

863
00:34:53,179 --> 00:35:00,530
them one of the common techniques of how

864
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:03,080
we would get root on UNIX systems was

865
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:06,680
using something called set UID set yeah

866
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,660
I set UID basically was a flag that was

867
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,180
set on the on the on the profile

868
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,299
information of a file that would execute

869
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:17,930
the file as the owner or the creator of

870
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,270
the file so if it was written by root it

871
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,419
would run as root and the trick was if

872
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,059
you

873
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:26,089
you get a program to hiccup and and and

874
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:27,980
halt execution very often it would just

875
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:29,540
kind of dump out into a shell but

876
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,609
because the state it was running in

877
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,950
route when it launched the shell and say

878
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:36,319
who we just crashed the shell would be a

879
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:39,859
route very common method for getting

880
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:41,930
Route back in those days I mentioned

881
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:44,598
earlier we had the bureaucratic problems

882
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,730
we had that charter problem this is sort

883
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,619
of a summary of the Charter but again

884
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,250
and you know the actual Charter is so

885
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:54,559
classified so I couldn't show it to you

886
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:58,849
but you know we were having the issues

887
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:02,420
of you know not only the bureaucracy but

888
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:04,280
also you know it came later and I'll get

889
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,490
to it but also this issue of why is the

890
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,500
NSA doing this stuff quickly another

891
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,618
date anybody remember pretty good

892
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,020
privacy do we still use PGP another

893
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:17,839
fanboy a moment I'm gonna skip this

894
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:21,319
story we had we had a we had a crisis

895
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,619
within our office at one point that had

896
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:27,049
to do with PGP but I don't think I have

897
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,490
time to tell that story buy me a drink

898
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:31,430
later and I'll tell the story for you

899
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:33,439
but again last fall last October I got

900
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,779
to meet Phil Zimmerman at a conference

901
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,490
so I've had a lot of fambly movements

902
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,410
meeting a lot of my idols in this

903
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:42,680
industry just in the last year it's been

904
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:46,730
kind of cool I am going to reveal one

905
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,859
top secret tradecraft attack method that

906
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,440
we used and please don't let it leave

907
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:55,369
this room you don't have to pause the

908
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,720
tape this was our primary attack tool

909
00:36:55,369 --> 00:37:03,589
when we were doing our reconnaissance

910
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:06,259
you ready for it you laughed but quite

911
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:08,420
literally if we wanted to follow the

912
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,160
rules in issue a ping command just to

913
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,559
see if there was a target out there not

914
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,680
yet alone whether it was responding it

915
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,750
would take us having to write it up and

916
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,230
wait 30 days to get permission to do it

917
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:23,510
and the reason was as we were we ended

918
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,819
up talking to the lawyers we called a

919
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,670
general counsel and their belief was

920
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:31,040
well you know if you're going to attack

921
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,299
a system you got to follow all these

922
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,630
rules you got to get all these

923
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:36,600
permissions and they

924
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:39,630
interpreted ping because it elicited a

925
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,640
response from the target they classified

926
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,800
it based on the definitions of the day

927
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,020
as an active attack and if it was an

928
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,490
active attack it had to go through the

929
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:54,210
30-day approval process that wasn't

930
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:55,770
working for us so we decided we were

931
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,840
going to try to educate the lawyers the

932
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,820
general counsel and for some reason I

933
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,220
took it upon myself to sort of lead this

934
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,080
spearhead this effort I think I was a

935
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,959
business major so I kind of knew how to

936
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,540
talk plain English to people I didn't

937
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,950
always do the technical stuff and I

938
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,130
actually have a brother that's a lawyer

939
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:16,560
so I think for better for worse I took

940
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,930
it upon myself to to try to talk to the

941
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,450
lawyers to explain our methodologies to

942
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,940
explain that was an imprecise science to

943
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,069
explain that a lot of what we did was

944
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,570
dependent on what we saw we didn't know

945
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,910
going into it without looking at

946
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:33,120
anything exactly what our attack

947
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,770
methodology was going to be so I set out

948
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,049
to try to teach them more of the

949
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,610
methodologies and more the concepts and

950
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:41,850
in the way of thinking about things

951
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:44,310
their thought was well just demonstrate

952
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:46,770
all the 50 hundred attack tools that you

953
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,420
have techniques that you have and you

954
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,610
know let us understand them so when a

955
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,040
new job comes in who's kind of like in

956
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,390
this this ala carte mentality just tell

957
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,490
us you're gonna do a little of this one

958
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:58,200
and a few of these and a couple of those

959
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,089
and we know what they are will

960
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,759
streamline streamline the process and

961
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,350
improve it rather quickly so I would

962
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,060
meet with them once a week there was a

963
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,339
popular show on at the time called home

964
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,080
improvement so I call it a tool time and

965
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,580
we spent once a week I'd spend like an

966
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,770
hour hour and a half with the general

967
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:17,040
counsel just trying to go through and

968
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,200
teach them what it meant to do hacking

969
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,330
what it meant to do and how you did

970
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,160
reconnaissance and how you did discovery

971
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:28,500
and the whole nine yards we were so good

972
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,779
at what we were doing that word got out

973
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,910
I mean we started out kind of doing you

974
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,070
know our own internal networks and and

975
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,990
obviously you know DoD and military

976
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:40,920
which is all secret and top secret

977
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:43,080
networks but somehow and I don't really

978
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,810
honestly know how it happened but you

979
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,270
know word got out in other military or

980
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:50,490
other government organizations

981
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:52,290
non-military this is sort of a summary

982
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:55,439
of an article that actually was written

983
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,790
a few years after I left I'll make these

984
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,320
slides available so you can read the

985
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,050
small print but essentially we were

986
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,360
approached by the Department of Justice

987
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,160
and the Department of Justice wanted to

988
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,030
have their website their internet

989
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,950
presence assessed by us we what we ended

990
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,320
up doing we called vulnerability and

991
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,060
threat assessment vta and so we had a

992
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,250
vulnerability and threat assessment

993
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,980
methodology vtm you got to have acronyms

994
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,810
in the military and of course the

995
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,270
lawyers got involved in this and the

996
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:26,670
problem was NSA was responsible for

997
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,740
classified networks who was responsible

998
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:31,260
for unclassified networks at the time

999
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,120
was NIST NIST at the time didn't really

1000
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,370
have any capability so NIST very

1001
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,920
routinely would sort of you know passed

1002
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:41,160
the pass that pass it along back to NSA

1003
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,410
with this convoluted bureaucratic

1004
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,170
political process we had to embark on

1005
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,120
this convoluted bureaucratic political

1006
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,560
process to be able to do what we weren't

1007
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,940
supposed to be doing but it was kind of

1008
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,490
understood that we could do it if we

1009
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:57,140
followed the rules you with me so far

1010
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:59,819
what we had to do is we had to get the

1011
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,670
the Attorney General who at the time was

1012
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:06,150
Janet Reno she had to write a letter to

1013
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:08,330
the basically was to the person that was

1014
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,610
responsible for this InfoSec stuff

1015
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:13,770
asking basically asking a favor saying

1016
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,570
hey can you do this for us we know it's

1017
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,730
not really you that's supposed to do it

1018
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,860
but we'd really like you to do it

1019
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:21,240
so there's the the letter it's in two

1020
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,810
parts but it was actually signed by

1021
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,750
Janet Reno we came up with a response

1022
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:34,710
and the response came from the director

1023
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:38,820
back to the DDI I'm sorry to the guy on

1024
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:40,830
the previous letter to go back to the

1025
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,420
Attorney General if you can read the

1026
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,549
small print you know it's from the

1027
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,410
director at the time the very last line

1028
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,570
there I was actually named as the point

1029
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:50,430
of contact so we're again this was a

1030
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,800
couple months process to try to get

1031
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,359
going to be able to go do a

1032
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,970
vulnerability and threat assessment of

1033
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,910
the DOJ web presence we're all up to

1034
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:01,828
21 August the letter had been signed it

1035
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,509
just hadn't been delivered and right

1036
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:06,150
before it was supposed to get delivered

1037
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:08,430
this happened we got it I got a call on

1038
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:11,040
a Monday morning from my contact at the

1039
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:13,440
DOJ saying oh my gosh our website was

1040
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,359
hacked help please help us

1041
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,990
does anybody remember this this was like

1042
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,980
the first hack of a government DoD web

1043
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:24,720
site so it was kind of a big deal and

1044
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,520
not only was there no methodologies back

1045
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,259
then on doing vulnerability threat

1046
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,030
assessment pen testing there was also no

1047
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,160
methodologies or procedures back then

1048
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,050
for doing forensics and back in those

1049
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,700
days if you had a website you are

1050
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,440
hosting it on your own server and your

1051
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,689
own network hopefully outside of

1052
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,460
firewall so it was internet facing and

1053
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,230
when they realized that they were

1054
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,510
breached the first thing they did was

1055
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:48,000
pull the plug and then what was the

1056
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:50,910
second thing they did rebuilt the system

1057
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,040
so whatever forensic evidence might have

1058
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,980
been there wasn't there but we didn't

1059
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,200
know that at the time I assembled a team

1060
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,329
mostly people from our little office in

1061
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,379
the pit and we went down to the DOJ for

1062
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:06,380
a couple days and set out to try to

1063
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,910
figure out what we could do to help them

1064
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,579
three or four days into it we actually

1065
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,950
got a phone call from the Home Office

1066
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:16,140
and the message I got from one of the

1067
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,669
guys that was left behind was the shit's

1068
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,089
hit the fan you guys got to drop what

1069
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:23,460
you're doing now and come back no drop

1070
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:25,078
what you're doing and come back so to

1071
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,839
make a long story short somebody

1072
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,760
somewhere in in in the bureaucracy had

1073
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,119
gotten wind of the fact that NSA was at

1074
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,800
a non secret top secret site doing

1075
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,109
things that are outside of the Charter

1076
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,329
which was when I became very familiar

1077
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:41,040
with the Charter because I was the

1078
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:44,310
ringleader they put me under

1079
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,759
investigation they essentially tried to

1080
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:50,578
fire me if not prosecute me a long story

1081
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,720
short I was absolved because I had to be

1082
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:53,730
interviewed by all sorts of security

1083
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,470
people and I said you know we just were

1084
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,380
trying to help I like it what's the big

1085
00:43:55,470 --> 00:44:00,180
deal it was a political mess we did

1086
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,400
learn a few things about forensics

1087
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,089
I actually was one of the contributing

1088
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,339
editors to I think was the first

1089
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:09,160
document that the SANS Institute put out

1090
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:11,828
about incident

1091
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,049
like you know preserve evidence don't

1092
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:15,730
wipe everything immediately try to start

1093
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:17,950
doing logging and put the log stuff

1094
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:22,329
stuff that we now understand it wasn't

1095
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:23,759
written down back then we were basically

1096
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:26,619
just you know slapped on the wrist

1097
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,599
reprimanded and told look you know we

1098
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:30,220
like what you guys do but if you're

1099
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,500
gonna do what you do here you got to do

1100
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,078
by you got to play by our rules and we

1101
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,730
kind of said most of us said okay it's a

1102
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:42,069
lot of us left

1103
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:47,049
there are technically six of us and the

1104
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:49,119
sound is working four of us have left

1105
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:50,890
and gone out into the private sector two

1106
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,170
of them are still at NSA the only one

1107
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:55,839
that I'm allowed to say publicly who was

1108
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:57,940
part of the pit is Ron gula he's the

1109
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,420
founder of tenable network security

1110
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:04,059
nessus let me see if I can turn that off

1111
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,380
very good we used to play that we had it

1112
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:07,210
on our laptops and when we were doing

1113
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,240
our thing we were we were geeks so we

1114
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:15,029
would play the Mission Impossible music

1115
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:18,609
anyway so the aftermath is another date

1116
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:21,190
and I think that is going back to that

1117
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:24,098
book dark territory chapter 4 was called

1118
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:29,460
eligible receiver eligible receiver was

1119
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:32,170
the first joint joint services wide

1120
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,170
coordinated pentest Red Team exercise

1121
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,880
that was performed by NSA it was done in

1122
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:38,920
1997 in June it was originally supposed

1123
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,599
to be like a 14 day exercise and they

1124
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,180
had to pull the plug after 3 or 4 days

1125
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:46,569
because they broken everything at that

1126
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:48,940
point it's interesting they did they did

1127
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:51,099
a symposium I guess it was on the 20th

1128
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:53,440
anniversary I think it was back in 2017

1129
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:55,029
where they invited a bunch of people and

1130
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,279
I think to the University of Maryland

1131
00:45:55,029 --> 00:45:58,029
University College and they put some of

1132
00:45:57,279 --> 00:45:59,770
it you know these were all the

1133
00:45:58,029 --> 00:46:01,240
bureaucrats and the political people got

1134
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,470
together to talk about all the cool

1135
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,078
thing that they did and that they

1136
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:07,779
coordinated and that's you can read more

1137
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:09,880
about it in the book I think the website

1138
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:12,490
is still active they actually for a

1139
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,740
little while had a 20-minute video that

1140
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:18,069
had been put together back in like 97 or

1141
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,930
98 kind of recapping the story they

1142
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,440
redacted it so it's about eight minutes

1143
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:23,299
out of the 20 minute video

1144
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,640
it was up there for a while I watched it

1145
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,250
I didn't grab it and then later they

1146
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,859
took it down but they had like an hour

1147
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,690
90 minute you know roundtable discussion

1148
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,460
which again I think they pulled the

1149
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,100
video on but I think if you go and ask

1150
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:39,560
them for it they might share it with

1151
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:42,259
interesting history lesson another date

1152
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,570
in history September 1st 1997 that's

1153
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,130
when an map came out we loved that map I

1154
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:48,740
used n map in the commercial world all

1155
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,600
the time it was wonderful

1156
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,069
those of us that are from the pit we

1157
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,960
still get together every once in a while

1158
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,940
and the guys who still work there they

1159
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,820
they bring us gifts sometimes so one of

1160
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:02,180
our meetings about two years ago so they

1161
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,380
brought us NSA secret sauce you can get

1162
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:06,049
this all at the National Cryptologic

1163
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,150
Museum by the way and a little pen that

1164
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:11,150
actually has a sort of like a bat

1165
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:12,890
warning light so that mug is the the

1166
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,050
projection of the NSA seal which is

1167
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,009
coming from the pen cool stuff you can

1168
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,760
get it at the National Cryptologic

1169
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:22,850
Museum so that's sort of this story and

1170
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,790
I apologize for going quickly there are

1171
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:27,860
more stories to tell obviously if you're

1172
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,200
interested in intrigue it occasionally

1173
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:33,020
comes up I mentioned on one of the hosts

1174
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,480
and Paul's security weekly so you can

1175
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,060
hear me off in there and very often I

1176
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,330
will tell stories of old because it

1177
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:43,310
comes up in conversation pack for kids

1178
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:45,200
is going on in Chicago right now hackers

1179
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,360
kids is teaching hacking skills to young

1180
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,149
people they put together a card game

1181
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:52,820
last year and sort of like one of these

1182
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:55,010
fantasy card trading games I'm not a

1183
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,560
young person I don't do it but they have

1184
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,450
face cards and I got to be one of the

1185
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,270
face cards and this is the majority of

1186
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:07,160
the face cards we were down I think two

1187
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:08,750
people Leslie Carr Hart and Josh Corman

1188
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,029
were not present for that photo

1189
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:13,400
they just they've actually released a

1190
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,770
second deck and there's five more face

1191
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,260
cards that they call in Hakman ism so if

1192
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:20,390
you want to do a fundraiser go to go to

1193
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,100
that and buy the deck it's it's

1194
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:23,569
educational because the whole game is

1195
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,580
all about the history of hacking and

1196
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:28,340
freaking in more detail but kind of the

1197
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:30,710
stuff I've been glossing over today I

1198
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,210
was recently included in a book that

1199
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,880
came out in January called tribe of

1200
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:36,680
hackers and they got tribe of hackers

1201
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,840
if you have it with you I'm happy to

1202
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,000
sign it if you don't have it I encourage

1203
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,500
you to go to Amazon and order it or just

1204
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,140
go to tribal Packard's that'll get you

1205
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:50,360
there it's like 15 20 bucks and it's an

1206
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:52,339
all proceeds go to charities I also was

1207
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,130
escorted one time to a talk by a bunch

1208
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:59,090
of storm troopers I consider myself a

1209
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:01,730
Jedi Master and probably what's most

1210
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:03,440
special to me is I am part of a group

1211
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,480
that's essentially a bunch of old people

1212
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,120
that get together once a year at RSA

1213
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,710
with Jean Stafford to go back early on

1214
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,930
in my presentation one of those books

1215
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,700
that we considered the Bible Jean

1216
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:15,830
Stafford's one of the authors he's been

1217
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,890
doing this for like 75 years he's

1218
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:21,049
amazing and I was invited to join this

1219
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:23,779
group it's invitation only you have to

1220
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:28,160
be sponsored and you get voted in or out

1221
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:29,930
and in an interesting twist the the

1222
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,730
person that I have my arm around there

1223
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:33,890
the guy in the red sweater that's

1224
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:36,710
actually the the lawyer that I used to

1225
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:38,930
deal with back at NSA we didn't get

1226
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,730
along too well right after that incident

1227
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,169
that I told you about and I didn't

1228
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:45,410
really speak to him for about 20 years

1229
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:48,020
but we've gotten reacquainted and he was

1230
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:50,690
the one that sort of introduced me and

1231
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:53,330
got me into this group so we're buds now

1232
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:56,300
turns out he took more knives in the

1233
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:59,540
back and was protecting us from even

1234
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:02,630
more trouble than I did get in so I

1235
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,980
thank him for that I don't know what

1236
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,860
we're doing on time but anybody have any

1237
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:10,580
questions comments maybe like 30 seconds

1238
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:12,290
if anybody has any question comment if

1239
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:21,310
you want to take me to a bar I can ask

1240
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:21,310
I can talk to Snowden yes uh-huh okay

1241
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,330
not in the commercial world and they

1242
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,330
still don't

1243
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,330
yep

1244
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:45,870
yeah and that's true yeah it's actually

1245
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,130
one of the things I've thought about you

1246
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:49,440
know like I showed the button you know

1247
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,330
the the book you know practical UNIX and

1248
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,850
Internet Security and hunting the wily

1249
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:56,069
hacker internet security the belief back

1250
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,569
then was let's just build a firewall

1251
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:00,330
let's just protect us from the evil

1252
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,830
internet and we'll be fine whatever goes

1253
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,330
on on the inside it doesn't matter

1254
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:05,250
because all we have to do is protect

1255
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:08,100
ourselves from the outside and then that

1256
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:10,650
that mentality was flawed somewhat as

1257
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,740
we've figured out and it still continues

1258
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,330
very often today so it's interesting you

1259
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,729
know what we used to call Internet

1260
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:19,020
security we now cost I'm not gonna say

1261
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:23,570
the word you know what I'm getting at

1262
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,570
any other questions or comments I

1263
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,840
