1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:15,509
all right we just start the slideshow

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:19,289
though hi I'm Nancy and this is my talk

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:24,359
which will eventually come up on there

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:27,680
you said like one random insecure web

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:34,050
application please and now I'm like go

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,940
do it yes I'm so it's ringing okay so

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,620
like you're ordering food and I just

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,629
abbreviated it or a lap so it's a

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,820
background on why I came up with this

10
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,949
and y'all are gonna get more background

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,320
about me personally that I've ever said

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,670
in a talk because it sort of it went

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,320
back to something I was interested when

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,510
I was 18

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,850
well I teach the cure coding a lot all

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,559
those thing so I started out this

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,870
teaching a group of Java developers who

18
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,670
did these gigantic monolithic apps but

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,560
then I started adding in people who did

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,479
micro services and nodejs and then

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,760
DevOps Python people and then data

22
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,470
scientist and then some people who did

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,070
like programming on a s for hundreds

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,900
ever added in

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,139
so like masses of all these different

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,570
groups of people doing all sorts of

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,460
different coding in different languages

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,220
and different things were relevant to

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,720
them so I mean originally I just sort of

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,658
started and I was just doing Java

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,158
developers creating my own app to sort

32
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,900
of show them in Java this is how you

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,200
need to code it correctly ii do think

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,799
this is incorrect this is correct cetera

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,360
so but as i started doing all these I

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,399
needed you example applications

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,220
regularly and maybe you could use some

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,750
of them to show people you can use some

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,250
of the same ones tweak to show people

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,470
different areas at least needed to look

41
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,450
at different types of vulnerabilities as

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,860
a regular view and a lot of times people

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,320
like to see things in their native

44
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,169
languages or things that are more

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:14,739
familiar with with certainly so

46
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:16,599
thing that came up yes so what happened

47
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:18,520
was I started you know to make two

48
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,349
examples I started changing stuff back

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,900
and forth in some existing applications

50
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,799
I created so yeah turning something on

51
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,620
turning it off

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,600
tweaking it to show data scientists one

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,980
thing and I don't know if any of you

54
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:35,709
doing data scientists they are the worst

55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:38,170
at writing secure code in my opinion but

56
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,180
yes but so yeah you turn things back and

57
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,910
forth depending on how well developed

58
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,180
they are and then also you wanted to

59
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,470
start changing things so I decided it

60
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,580
was boring to change the code all the

61
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,200
time so I started just putting in some

62
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,019
boolean flag to turn some stuff on and

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,959
off that was sort of how the whole idea

64
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,130
got started with oh I can just sort of

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,540
do that and then I started customizing

66
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,459
the themes because if you're teaching

67
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,030
the same people like they have a yearly

68
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:07,569
requirement you know my first one was I

69
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,100
think I did overpoweringly cute cats the

70
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,170
vulnerable web application where it was

71
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,820
for sharing cute cat photos of course

72
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,589
you had your own private cute cat photo

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,450
that you could keep hidden and other

74
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,890
things like that and their admin's em

75
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,108
all that fun so that was my first one

76
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,018
but people get bored of seeing my cute

77
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,690
cats every year so I don't understand

78
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,370
that one myself but

79
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,859
so I started customizing the themes a

80
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,459
bit and I started trying to do that in a

81
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:35,170
way that it was programmable or so that

82
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,630
was really easy to change out and have

83
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,980
to go in and change the topic codes so

84
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,549
then I just thought well why can't I

85
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,399
randomly use this base application and

86
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:48,370
start selecting data and options or

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:54,640
several based application is the hope

88
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:57,130
because eventually but yes and the

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,108
reason most people would probably say so

90
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,620
randomly putting boolean flags are not

91
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:05,319
easy obviously but randomly generating a

92
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,389
whole web application with data users

93
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,700
and like as I said like for

94
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:11,620
overpoweringly cute cat cat photos and

95
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,179
things like that that gets a little more

96
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,040
complicated for some people to think

97
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,240
about so those comments and

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,040
all sorts of language but lucky for me I

99
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,960
love natural language understanding that

100
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,270
was what I was originally into when I

101
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:31,159
was 18 19 so I actually was just like

102
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,409
this is going to combine what I used to

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,930
love before I get into security with

104
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:40,010
what I love now because I get to do some

105
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,260
genetic linkage generation yeah and if

106
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,960
you really want to know back when I was

107
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,270
in college yeah I wanted to actually get

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,520
a PhD that was my original plan to get a

109
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,900
PhD at MIT studying artificial

110
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,539
intelligence I want to work with Marvin

111
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,159
Minsky that shows how old I was I am a

112
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:00,320
bit since he's now dead he was alive

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,660
then and working yes and I actually did

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,520
a senior project that was a like a

115
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,350
chatbot that was to enter in the lob

116
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,090
enterprise contest I don't know if that

117
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,960
still goes on but you know that was an

118
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,940
instantiation of the Turing test you

119
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,770
know can machines think so it was like

120
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,040
supposed to be like that so I had a lot

121
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,310
of fun with natural language and in grad

122
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,290
school even I worked for two linguists

123
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,230
who were working on morphologies and so

124
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:30,440
for ancient languages and so I wrote

125
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:34,400
this Perl code that compiled languages

126
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,410
into Prolog really crazy but it would

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,460
generate complete verb morphologies in

128
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:44,450
ancient Sanskrit and Biblical Hebrew so

129
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,760
this is all my background which is why I

130
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,110
thought I could do this and I even took

131
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,240
some shortcuts doing it because there's

132
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:54,430
actually a lot to generating language so

133
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,630
all right

134
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:04,100
so now let's talk a little bit about the

135
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,950
design for the random generation so I

136
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,460
had never coated in that jest before so

137
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,140
I decided to try it I was just like you

138
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,049
know that's something I haven't done all

139
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,479
right this edge is give it a shot

140
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,480
obviously what that means is since

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,880
that's not a compiled language I'll just

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,800
go ahead and do the warning that

143
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,510
occasionally if a random path hasn't

144
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,980
actually happened yet I could still get

145
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,810
errors that I don't know about in the

146
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,410
code that's a warning for the dim

147
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,330
coming up but I have three randomly

148
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,610
generated web applications already

149
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:43,909
deployed on my thing it completely fails

150
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:45,680
or we can just try again okay so and the

151
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,760
process is slightly made there a few

152
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,990
manual steps to you generate the files

153
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm hoping to get it completely

154
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:59,210
automated in the next two weeks actually

155
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,770
I plan on making some updates but yes we

156
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,510
had so much

157
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,520
uh yeah everyone always has so much

158
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,740
going on but our son actually had a

159
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,169
broken leg for it was in this horrible

160
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,970
spike a cat for six weeks very recently

161
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,139
and just got out and so that did delay

162
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,450
me in getting a few last-minute things

163
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,160
done if anyone's ever seen a spike a

164
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,719
cast their evil horrible you don't want

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,910
to take care of children in them okay

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,860
but somewhat manual process still but we

167
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,780
will generate the random files will copy

168
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,510
them into where they go in the base

169
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,539
application compile and deploy so it's

170
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:35,690
not that hard cuts will be a bit better

171
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,300
automated okay now we'll do a demo and

172
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,669
the steps for the demo are on the next

173
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,690
slide which will go afterwards I'll also

174
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,659
look at a couple of the other

175
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,700
applications just so you can see the

176
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:50,680
differences all right

177
00:07:46,700 --> 00:08:00,469
is that going to come back all right

178
00:07:50,680 --> 00:08:03,169
just so you all can see it alright so so

179
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,880
yes it's just a very simple thing you

180
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,700
just tell it at location to put the

181
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,100
files at moment and as a get parameter

182
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,740
and it will generate something for you

183
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,050
and let me clear out that directory that

184
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,430
I'm going to tell it to put the file in

185
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:22,850
so you know that that I didn't just you

186
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,770
know it's just this so everyone knows

187
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,030
that actually generated them and also in

188
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:38,150
case there are any errors it'll be

189
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:41,299
obvious running my server and I have a

190
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,860
ah okay I did a very dangerous thing I

191
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:51,319
tweaked the code last night I felt a

192
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:52,610
breakpoint in there yeah that was Lily I

193
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,680
didn't like the way something looked

194
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,800
when I was practicing my demo so I

195
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:03,469
tweaked the code last night so it looks

196
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:07,510
like in generate files so so although I

197
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,510
have two sets of files here I don't like

198
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,150
yeah I definitely do it she's at the

199
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,670
files there I'm gonna try this one more

200
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,730
time and see it because there are two

201
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,410
set types of sets of images from so

202
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,630
seems to be generating a lot of things

203
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,400
about cats today I do have cat stuff in

204
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,530
there but it's really sort of strange I

205
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,720
almost wanted the random number

206
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:34,730
generation leaning towards cats because

207
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:38,900
for some reason but let's see if we got

208
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,290
a good files looking okay that should

209
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,380
work

210
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:46,550
alright so I'm just going to copy the

211
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:49,329
files where they go I should have that

212
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,329
open somewhere

213
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:06,689
okay I don't know location I want open

214
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:13,109
but one second actually probably over

215
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:15,779
here yeah yeah perfect so this is a copy

216
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:18,269
of the base app so I'm just first

217
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,369
copying the palm file then the one Java

218
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,489
file which is an app constants it

219
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:25,649
generated it generated some SQL files

220
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:29,119
which will put data in the databases

221
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:31,919
there's an embedded database in this I

222
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:35,160
have a lot of things I'd love to add to

223
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,410
it that I haven't there's a ton of data

224
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:54,108
involved I'll just go and say but let's

225
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:58,949
see that one then the database files

226
00:10:54,109 --> 00:11:00,720
they're here in fact I'm doing this talk

227
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:08,699
again in two weeks I hope to have this

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:11,129
piece automated by then same because it

229
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:13,589
would be easier and it's really not that

230
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:16,019
hard and the fact that it isn't hard is

231
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,249
why I put it off at the end if you know

232
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,379
what I mean because it's just copying

233
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:21,209
the file to a specific location that's

234
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:25,079
really quite easy and so I put it off to

235
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:28,638
the end and never got it done you have I

236
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:34,040
kept wanting to improve the other output

237
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:38,369
so okay the SQL files the constants

238
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:48,230
there's a CSS file and then there's some

239
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:48,230
images so this source man web app

240
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:04,329
and then the images will go here and and

241
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:11,259
we'll see what it looks like and cetera

242
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:21,279
I have a feeling that doesn't look right

243
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:23,589
but yeah very strange file right here

244
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,239
probably there's a broken image going to

245
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:27,239
happen but we'll try it anyway sometimes

246
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:36,910
so and as I said I have three others

247
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:38,589
already up and deployed so compile maven

248
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,939
clean package because it's you all saw

249
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:47,730
the palm file obviously it's using maven

250
00:12:41,939 --> 00:13:02,049
build success so good just grab the

251
00:12:47,730 --> 00:13:09,759
water and deploy it real quick amazing

252
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:11,319
cute cats waters generated okay and I'll

253
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,269
talk about how it decides on topics

254
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:16,569
later I mean obviously I'm using random

255
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:28,029
number generators that's pretty obvious

256
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:30,729
so so here we go hey so they work yes it

257
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,919
randomly chose geo bootstrap I love that

258
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,899
it's one of twelve bootstraps available

259
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:44,319
that's my favorite thing Twitter ever

260
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:48,459
did was this bootstrap anyone no well

261
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:52,319
yes so it gives you a website yes you

262
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:55,118
know supposed to look like the 80s

263
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:57,660
create account thing and password help

264
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,660
about us

265
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,089
hey I'm sober let's see what happened to

266
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,320
the about us so in 2002 Michael Davis

267
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,540
found an amazing keycaps

268
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,339
oh I see adult this is no good we have

269
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,949
an error that haven't quite fixed but

270
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:13,839
Michael accompanied his half-sister Ella

271
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,570
Davis the well-known archaeology one of

272
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,579
her trips to China when he was 14 and on

273
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,209
that he meant he rescued cute cats

274
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:23,949
facing starvation by societal negligence

275
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:26,800
this verb his love of archaeology and

276
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,540
the cat's obviously okay I don't know

277
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,609
what I have Mel there but obviously

278
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,319
there are a couple things the website is

279
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,260
like everyone who loves it wants to

280
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,880
discover amazing cute cats so yes that's

281
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,870
an example of the natural language

282
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,010
generation which is not horrible but

283
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,209
could use a little help

284
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:49,000
I got robots facing starvation the other

285
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,069
day which that one I liked about it to

286
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,019
be really funny if possible like if

287
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,880
they're way out there I like that you

288
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,620
know something like this is not likely

289
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,329
to actually beat you I like that one it

290
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:03,459
generates stories background stories

291
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:10,599
like that but see a secret will go I

292
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:14,189
love aliens okay but I don't want them

293
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,329
to be absolutely completely horrible so

294
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,709
let's just take a look and see what

295
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:22,180
people are posting about amazing cute

296
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:24,310
cats hello and welcome so yeah it

297
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,729
generated this content that's my cat

298
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,920
Constantine reading social engineering

299
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,390
that's the book on that is his head

300
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,930
Naji's poop on social engineering that

301
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,640
cat is reading just since I know no one

302
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,589
can see it I thought I'd share so

303
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,120
welcome to my awesome site on cute cat

304
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,829
blasting off with Constantine reading

305
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,510
the social engineering book enjoy

306
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:49,180
we have comments no but yes so I mean it

307
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,870
generated content and they're going to

308
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,790
be a lot of security and do it came up

309
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,170
with a random admin that's interesting

310
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,170
need opinions what do you all think

311
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,800
Luna's 76 I'm attached to that pit so

312
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:10,860
yes it did come up with comments okay so

313
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,870
you know generated some sites let's see

314
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,000
here's another site that was generated I

315
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,160
don't know it's been generating cats a

316
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,660
lot I might want to check my topic

317
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,920
generation because this one I did last

318
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,110
night and you see it looks totally

319
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,949
different in terms of just look and feel

320
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:29,470
and obviously one could start looking at

321
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,150
cookies Oh see for example this one has

322
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,530
a username cookie called test which

323
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,959
obviously immediately tells us something

324
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,870
out of permissions cookie that one what

325
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,690
about this one over here you know oh and

326
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,330
there's this manage button up here that

327
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,640
looks like them that could be probably

328
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,580
shouldn't be there it doesn't give me

329
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,380
anything but I have a link to a hidden

330
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,220
management page something it should be

331
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:56,170
hidden so yes they said allow this is I

332
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,880
don't actually it's going to be very

333
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,800
insecure due to some reasons I'm going

334
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,820
to say here's another look and as I said

335
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,770
unfortunately everything I was

336
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,040
generating was about cats which is only

337
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:09,190
one of like a dozen topics I set up to

338
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:13,709
be in there which is so funny that it

339
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,709
randomly chose up three times recently

340
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:22,060
it may be yes that could be it it's a it

341
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:23,800
knows that so but obviously the looks at

342
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:30,370
least can be quite different and even

343
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:32,350
the URLs and so and there will be other

344
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,939
things that are if you started going

345
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,290
through it they'd be some very like with

346
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,510
burp suite or something to be some very

347
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,649
obvious security things

348
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:46,150
this one has some client-side validation

349
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:53,770
it looks like yeah password checker so

350
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:56,410
fun anyway so I think that's just a

351
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,600
basic that's how the demo works let's go

352
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,700
back to the slideshow and we can talk a

353
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,699
bit more about design and such

354
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:21,140
here we have one moment and I'm gonna go

355
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:25,430
it stupid coffee well that's for me that

356
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,880
really does take a while doesn't it all

357
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,030
right

358
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,250
so these are the steps we had to do

359
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,230
really quick well I left off download

360
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,440
the base web application which is on

361
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,810
github and publicly available so that's

362
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,330
easy but then you generate the files and

363
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,280
you copy the palm to the may in the app

364
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,620
constants to source main Java com

365
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,840
security magic the DB files the source

366
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,459
main resources DB and I'm just doing

367
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,490
this really quick because that's what we

368
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,010
just did copy bootstrap that CSS to the

369
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,860
source main web app core CSS copy all

370
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,140
the image files source main web app core

371
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:13,040
images compile maven clean package

372
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:15,920
deployed copy that some of the options

373
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,330
and oddities and might go back and look

374
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,600
at one of the sites to see some of the

375
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,669
stuff in a few minutes cuz but the first

376
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,100
thing is it's more likely to be very

377
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,070
insecure than anything else and this is

378
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,360
just because of the way the options are

379
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,800
I have so many options for different

380
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,209
ways things can be insecure and

381
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,080
generally only one way for it to be

382
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:39,410
secure so for example if I look at the

383
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,110
see certain I have three different

384
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,120
boolean options one that turns it on it

385
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:47,479
off in general one that chooses whether

386
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,350
I generate a good random sinc token one

387
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,850
that chooses whether I use a

388
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,669
synchronizer token or a different

389
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,709
implementation which is similar to the

390
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,780
double cookie defenses up there I always

391
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,850
mix up that one the double submit cookie

392
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,280
and the one we have the cookie and the

393
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,949
header and it checks them you know what

394
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,340
I mean I can't remember the exact term

395
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,650
for that anyone know okay something

396
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,199
village that what

397
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:15,300
yeah but something like that and so you

398
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,700
have these three different boolean

399
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,850
options turning things on and that gives

400
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,290
you obviously eight possibilities and so

401
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,620
seven of them are going to be insecure

402
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,850
and only one is going to be secure so

403
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,909
what happens is you're much more likely

404
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,699
of something that's very insecure

405
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,400
because this is one where you have yet

406
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,260
three options some of the things like

407
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,790
forgot password has eight options going

408
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,050
on in it so do it correctly secure so in

409
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:46,020
unless you go through and actually make

410
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,960
some selections you know change things

411
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,410
up your might be so insecure that it's

412
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:58,880
hilariously funny as opposed to

413
00:20:51,410 --> 00:21:01,290
challenging so so that's a note and then

414
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,480
so this is just like what are some of

415
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,639
the security options in general that are

416
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,130
these are all currently there there's a

417
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,080
lot more I'd love to add but obviously

418
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,960
there's some SQL injection example these

419
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,970
are individual like is there SQL

420
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,370
injection in this field or not on/off

421
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,540
and virtually SQL injection could be

422
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,060
really annoying actually

423
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,620
please unless it's at least somewhat

424
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,230
covered up I find it really annoying if

425
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,699
anytime you type it you know the right

426
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,130
character you get an error that's just

427
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,960
annoying so as a general I think it's

428
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,000
actually minimally have four spots I

429
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,430
have possible SQL injection at all

430
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,670
because I just find it annoying although

431
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,380
you do want the example there are

432
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,990
examples of all types of cross-site

433
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,870
scripting including the Dom one which

434
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,970
you don't see that a lot in applications

435
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,070
in fact I it was really sort of hard to

436
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,920
contrive an example for it and I

437
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:56,220
actually had to output in code to keep

438
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:59,190
it from being stored one I had to be is

439
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,410
outputting coding and the web page to it

440
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,630
that's thought it was to be honest it

441
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,400
was like in the language and choices I

442
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,960
was making it seems like it was actually

443
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,490
I did have to contrive getting a

444
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,150
document object model one out there but

445
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,150
there is one

446
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:18,629
so obviously things like user numeration

447
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:21,718
turn off see syrup forgot password which

448
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:23,189
has its massive eight options there's

449
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:25,679
some stuff going on a registration

450
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,749
there's file uploads failure to restrict

451
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,729
URL axis some encryption and hashing

452
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:31,799
options all the normal things you

453
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:33,869
probably want to teach programmers if

454
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:38,099
you're teaching that sort of thing and

455
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:40,408
they can also be fun to play with so I

456
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,489
have prototypes for services for adding

457
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:43,829
in but I haven't quite figured out how

458
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:46,079
to do that

459
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:49,079
so yes I'm prototyping some other things

460
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,009
like for some microservice stuff to add

461
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:55,559
in like a service for something and also

462
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:57,599
oh yes I'm trying out something with a

463
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,089
no SQL Dave or their embedded no SQL

464
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:04,139
database so it should be fun but I don't

465
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:06,029
have it ready yet put in here so sorry

466
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:11,789
but hopefully those will be in it soon

467
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:14,269
is my clan and yes I will see lots of

468
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:19,049
I'll probably be updating this a lot

469
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:22,079
between now and September when I think I

470
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:24,059
start teaching a code again this year so

471
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,519
I plan on making some changes so I can

472
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,989
use it for that but then there's some

473
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,969
wet settings that just don't work well

474
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,440
together like in forgot password since

475
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:34,249
there were the two main modes where you

476
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,229
have a side channel where you don't and

477
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:39,389
it doesn't actually send you an email I

478
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:43,319
have a pretend email that it shows you

479
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:45,418
in a modal because well it's a you don't

480
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,889
want to give up insecure fake app a real

481
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,499
email address and have it sending mail

482
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:51,029
that just yeah that doesn't work so it

483
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:53,129
sends you a pretend email and it turns

484
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:55,249
on a side channel but some of the

485
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:57,329
options were just sort of hilariously

486
00:23:55,249 --> 00:24:00,269
they turned out sort of hilarious

487
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:04,649
together I will say because for example

488
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:06,569
if you have it just have no side channel

489
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,708
but then you turned off on the side

490
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:09,299
gentle you don't need to answer the

491
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:10,829
secret question then it's just like you

492
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,690
can enter anyone and reset the email you

493
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:14,999
never want that to show up I mean that's

494
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,559
just too ridiculous I thought so I

495
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:18,509
turned off those and made some exclusive

496
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,119
options this these occasionally show up

497
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:22,949
and then one has to fix the code so you

498
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,070
have things that are conclusive instead

499
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:34,430
of inclusive in your orange

500
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:36,800
but um there are let's see about it was

501
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,920
47 boolean security options right now

502
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,990
that turn on and off I think it is and

503
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,930
then there's a hope there's other things

504
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,880
that are semi security related like some

505
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,500
of the cookies and encodings and things

506
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,630
like that but you can say some of that

507
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,590
is but that's different but it's not

508
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:57,020
exactly that then there's in the look

509
00:24:54,590 --> 00:25:02,060
and feel this was actually the easiest

510
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:04,760
to do because to the example I just used

511
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,740
12 different bootstrap themes for into

512
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,830
the random choice from 1 to 12 throw

513
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,110
that file out there so that was really

514
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,710
easy and then of course you randomly

515
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:17,090
choose a font color now I have a chose a

516
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,990
whole bunch of bright colors that would

517
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:23,389
look good on white or black you know so

518
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,160
font size with the Khans bootstrap

519
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,100
column layout fonts are all based on

520
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,840
bootstrap so if I can choose different

521
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,429
column layouts the forms labels menus

522
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:39,980
the data this is where it's interesting

523
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:41,900
this would be data and complex data the

524
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,060
simple data was generating a username or

525
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,530
password I'm sure everyone can figure

526
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,169
out how to do that although I will

527
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:51,020
briefly tell you what I did the complex

528
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,750
data is actually generating like you

529
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:59,120
know the about Us page or something like

530
00:25:53,750 --> 00:26:02,540
that so first what are the simple data

531
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,030
is and I have a slide that says that in

532
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,310
a minute but I was gonna say that I

533
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,910
think there over 81 different types of

534
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:13,580
data I'm using in this so I'm probably

535
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:17,240
not listening everything but the user

536
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,189
names are certainly an easy choice and

537
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,090
they're two different ways it does user

538
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:26,210
names one of them is based on topic so

539
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,459
if you have a topic like Greek temples

540
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,700
or something you might end up with user

541
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,440
names like I love the Parthenon because

542
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,090
it chooses something based on that or

543
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,280
you could always have user names that

544
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,280
are like name based like John 76

545
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:46,300
passwords very easy I started with one

546
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,920
of the smaller rocky lists smaller

547
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,460
because I didn't want that

548
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,050
you know the rocky lip is gigantic so I

549
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,670
didn't want to be dealing that I serve

550
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,389
with a smaller rocky list I added a

551
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:00,700
couple stronger passwords to it for a

552
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,110
little variety and then there's a chance

553
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,520
that it might have a special character

554
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,459
capitalization to the password it

555
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,470
selects pretty easy I think that's a one

556
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,930
in five chance so to be honest yes most

557
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:14,410
of them are very brute forcible will go

558
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:15,550
in then there's a secret or a favorite

559
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,800
that I generally ask for registration

560
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,169
like maybe your favorite zoo baby or

561
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,030
your a secret about me oh that's your

562
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,970
secret answer sort of thing

563
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,680
now those the secrets actually are a bit

564
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,980
what I do with post because there's a

565
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,420
way to make them related to the topic

566
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,090
the same with the fit but I mean for

567
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,400
favorites and whatever as I said temple

568
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,919
it knows what some Greek temples are

569
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,480
because you told it you have to tell it

570
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,610
or you can give it access to Google I

571
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,190
considered that but I was a little

572
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:48,399
afraid to let it out images from Google

573
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,320
because of well who knows what you're

574
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,880
going to get it could be adult content I

575
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,960
didn't want to do that for anything I

576
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,190
was showing you can end up with a me and

577
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,660
I think that their way you can tell it

578
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,860
never to give you a adult content but it

579
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,360
could be wrong who knows so I mean I I

580
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,290
was thinking of making that an option

581
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,750
where it could pick things out of the

582
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:11,670
internet too but a little braid of that

583
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:14,590
for especially for demo purposes so

584
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,910
whether or not it has an extra admin now

585
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,740
the person who created the site it

586
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,150
always creates somebody who's the person

587
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,460
who created the site they're always an

588
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:24,550
admin and there's always some admin

589
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,400
functionality but yes but does it have

590
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,480
an extra admin like the URLs because if

591
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,340
you actually go through that you'll see

592
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,470
they're not all like it's not always

593
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,330
login to the login page or forgot

594
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,180
password that actually changes up the

595
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:39,010
URLs for you so you have different sites

596
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:41,710
the verbiage is change like four basic

597
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,110
things like no such user or that sort of

598
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,740
error like the just basic error message

599
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,659
Burbridge and I was a cookie names

600
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,100
change although that's possibly security

601
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,139
related to

602
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:58,928
but I think it was just more simple data

603
00:28:53,139 --> 00:29:02,019
so that's the simple day that I think so

604
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:03,759
the complex data the first thing is the

605
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:05,980
topic and obviously the random number

606
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:11,620
generators were being not too random

607
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:13,960
here recently but so it was obviously

608
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:18,370
you have to be a little bit creative and

609
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:21,970
how to generate this so I basically

610
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:26,918
there's a main topic which is obviously

611
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:30,309
they're not all cat I promise this is

612
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,529
where but yet cat is one of them but yet

613
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:34,299
there's a main topic and I think I have

614
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:35,860
about a dozen main topics that it can

615
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:38,080
choose from and then there's a

616
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,678
possibility it has a secondary topic

617
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,049
which will you know make that more focus

618
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,610
like it might be robots or could be the

619
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,720
secondary topic would might be make it

620
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:52,240
robots from Doctor Who that sort of

621
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,879
thing and then there's a possible

622
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,549
modifier added to that which gives you

623
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:59,769
the title of the site the modifier is of

624
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:03,190
course when it becomes amazing robots

625
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:06,399
from doctor here or absolutely so that's

626
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:10,149
how it does uses basically three sets of

627
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,070
lists for that and will generate a topic

628
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,860
and that topic is necessary for

629
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,610
generating all the content because

630
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,309
otherwise you don't know what you're

631
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,139
supposed to be writing about or what

632
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:22,149
you're having images up or what type of

633
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:24,908
page you have and I'd love to have

634
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:26,830
different types of pages - it's a future

635
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:30,309
project to add some more different

636
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:32,110
things of then like posts or blog

637
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:35,500
information or things like that now that

638
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:41,139
is where you start needing real natural

639
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:42,480
language and so I was like so you needed

640
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,100
some shortcuts you couldn't actually

641
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,490
where I remember writing some great code

642
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,259
a long time ago that did syntax and

643
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,389
semantics and parsing of grammars and

644
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:54,610
would do all this stuff it was complexed

645
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:57,340
and it was just like yes I don't think

646
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,439
this that's really what you need because

647
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,480
no one's really here for the topic for

648
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:09,179
the content so

649
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:11,669
who remembers mad lids yes it for anyone

650
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,230
who doesn't I found some in the French

651
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,080
Quarter last night so you need to try

652
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,640
them out

653
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:22,260
come get a mad lib after this do it with

654
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:24,900
a friend at the happy hour tonight or

655
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,549
make a new friend but yes for those of

656
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,070
you who are not familiar with Mad Libs

657
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:31,080
yet you have these great things where

658
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,850
they say give a first name an adjective

659
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,600
a place a verb

660
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,820
plural noun and it fills in something

661
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,129
that's sort of what I did with the purse

662
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:43,740
except it wasn't quite as general that

663
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:47,190
some of them were put in the topic of

664
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,260
the site the base topic singular put in

665
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,540
the description of the photo some of

666
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:55,200
them were put in an additive put in you

667
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:57,210
know that sort of thing but yes but

668
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,880
that's sort of how we did the post was

669
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:06,600
Mad Libs and the comments were similar

670
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,760
there's also some formatting on how each

671
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,439
user talks which is decided when it

672
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,929
creates the user whether there are the

673
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,000
type of person who's all lowercase did

674
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:17,610
they use punctuation maybe they don't

675
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,350
maybe we removed that it does a lot of

676
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,719
fun formatting around that to try to

677
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,129
make the people a little different you

678
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,870
could obviously do a lot more of that if

679
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,940
you wanted to be really creative but I

680
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:31,350
figure that's not really the purpose I

681
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:34,440
just want it to be a touch different see

682
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:38,969
how my day on time 11:33 good plenty of

683
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:42,929
time so then there's the about us page

684
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:44,100
in the founder and I'm gonna go back to

685
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:46,290
something else I remember I didn't

686
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,678
mention about the post but let me talk

687
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,928
about this first so that's actually one

688
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,179
of the that was actually probably the

689
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:56,580
hardest part was to come up with

690
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:58,799
background stories for the thing that

691
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,210
was actually probably the this part

692
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,330
where you needed things to sort of sync

693
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,190
up and make sense like it was about that

694
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:08,480
so they have a background story that

695
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,710
makes sense account the topic and and

696
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,779
there are a couple of different types in

697
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:18,019
fact actually we only looked at one

698
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:23,990
let's see if I have a different type up

699
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:25,399
here actually because let's see temple

700
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:31,159
cats for peace and light this should

701
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:38,299
have a different one count home okay so

702
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:40,159
about us 7 in 2001 hazel powder hazel

703
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:42,168
Potter founded temple cats for light and

704
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,179
peace hazel had suffered from depression

705
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:45,649
at a young age and started the site to

706
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:46,899
help other sufferers through common

707
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:49,309
interest in cats

708
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,840
Hazel's depression was so bad vigil um

709
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:53,450
and she couldn't get out of bed space

710
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,470
tissue fix that later finally she

711
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,059
discovered light and peace through

712
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,499
temple cats and setting archaeology

713
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:02,539
hazel advises taking things one day at a

714
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:04,399
time and this is to connect everyone who

715
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:06,379
let wants to discover temple cats for

716
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,109
light and peace so this means this one

717
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:11,000
got tagged as a self-help website the

718
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:15,918
for light and peace is what told me that

719
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,599
that I got tied to self-help so it has

720
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,009
that sort of thing that when actually

721
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,950
something together fairly well example

722
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:27,440
the archaeology which this random bit of

723
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:29,839
information okay um so but yet so like

724
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,619
you have a background story the one we

725
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,940
looked at earlier what was it they were

726
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:36,679
they were helping to fight the

727
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,359
negligence of stray cats who were

728
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,589
starving yes something like that

729
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:41,239
so you think they have different

730
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:44,389
background so she's suffering depression

731
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:47,058
he's they're fighting the starving cat

732
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:50,079
negligent so you have these so yeah

733
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:52,579
there's different base wives as they

734
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,220
based on the topic if the topic is

735
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:57,650
something that could be applied to

736
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:00,020
self-help like Timbo cap for light and

737
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,750
peace zoo babies for soothing stress

738
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,369
relief or something like that or it

739
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:08,180
might even be monsters from doctor who I

740
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:10,460
think might show up as one of these it

741
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,140
depends on how it is like but if it's

742
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,839
the sort of thing that could be applied

743
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,520
to this then it might come up as a

744
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,960
self-help like this where it's something

745
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,020
where somebody suffering from depression

746
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,299
insomnia agoraphobia and they're using

747
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,549
this topic to cure themselves supposedly

748
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:28,030
I don't recommend this to actually cure

749
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:32,270
any of those things

750
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:37,850
so let me go back to the slideshow

751
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:39,770
though there's not much left but then

752
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,930
there's the type where somebody's trying

753
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,640
to do something that's like a that

754
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,410
they're trying to fix a problem like

755
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,170
help stop the poachers of the white

756
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,920
rhino help the cat's facing starvation

757
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:53,270
I got robots facing starvation once I

758
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,680
wasn't sure whether I should fix that so

759
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:58,070
it never happens or if it was just funny

760
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:09,200
and I should keep it I hadn't decided

761
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:10,970
yet but we'll see so and obviously as I

762
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,020
said I was thinking getting some images

763
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:16,430
from Google but was afraid to do that so

764
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,080
at the moment obviously you have

765
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,580
different images that could easily fit

766
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,799
in lots of different topics and there

767
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,810
was a method of how do i I only want to

768
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,610
store them once how do I tag them

769
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,710
properly so in a way I can easily find

770
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:31,040
out what goes to what that was actually

771
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:34,970
one of the tougher issues was you might

772
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,040
have a picture of let's say the Minotaur

773
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,930
episode of Doctor Who you might have

774
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,430
that it would apply to Doctor Who

775
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,919
monsters they would apply to Greek

776
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:46,430
monsters Roman monsters and monsters for

777
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,990
topics okay so you want it to be tagged

778
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,879
for all of those you only want to store

779
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:53,209
it once somewhere in a way that you can

780
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,580
find it located for monsters and I ended

781
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,320
up just setting up directories for all

782
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,790
topics with secondaries and using

783
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,920
symbolic links so I don't know how to

784
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,810
storm once which is a bit of a mess

785
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,090
setting up and maybe it's not the best

786
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:08,810
way but I didn't want to store it four

787
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:10,490
times that is what I definitely didn't

788
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,380
want to do I mean I suppose I could have

789
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:16,160
an index somewhere that knows that which

790
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,300
one's apply to which a database I wasn't

791
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,310
sure that was actually one of the things

792
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:23,240
I had serious issues coming out how to

793
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:25,279
do that one properly but as I said so

794
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,080
the founders they have either the self

795
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,090
help they were trying to fix the sale

796
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,610
cause for this is just my hobby and I'm

797
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,980
sharing it with you so three types of

798
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:38,630
founders that it generates different

799
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:40,050
stories based on and total not counting

800
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,420
CSS and images

801
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:46,350
I have 81 different types of data that

802
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:51,270
I'm loading in to this so that's a lot

803
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:53,069
of different types of data and obviously

804
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:57,810
I have a lot of improvements I'm still

805
00:37:53,070 --> 00:38:00,780
trying to work on more data obviously is

806
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:02,250
something I want to do and I want to

807
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,720
automate it as I said I'm hoping to get

808
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,930
the automation done so don't leave

809
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,419
automatically copy the files over and do

810
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:11,359
the compile for you that should be easy

811
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,890
enough to do in the next two weeks

812
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:18,480
before I do this talk again at circles

813
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:20,700
did he come so and then basically

814
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,280
besides that I'm generating a lot of

815
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,660
them and tweaking the problems I see

816
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,400
that come up as well as I want to add a

817
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,109
few more security features as I

818
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,170
mentioned I'm working on a couple they

819
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,730
know SQL embedded databases and adding

820
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,770
in a micro service thing or the two I'm

821
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:38,730
currently working on and some of the

822
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:41,070
security things and I have webs

823
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,410
I have code that's works I just have to

824
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:46,320
import it into the base app I have you

825
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:52,049
know similar code working for those

826
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:55,170
things so tweaking problems and let's

827
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,850
see so I may have been talking a little

828
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,490
fast but here's my contact information

829
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:02,190
those are the bait app is I didn't put a

830
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:05,069
link to I need to make it non private

831
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:07,530
I've been tweaking the random generator

832
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:10,290
so much I have it private but it should

833
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,000
it's awesome in my github and I just

834
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:16,200
need to mark the thing to make the repo

835
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,520
public which I will do I've just been

836
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,859
tweaking it so much I didn't want people

837
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,040
looking at it if you know what I mean

838
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:26,040
which is really silly I'm a bit of a

839
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,770
perfect perfectionist which is really

840
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,320
bad when you're sharing things if you

841
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:38,430
want anyone can relate to that but does

842
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:40,110
anyone have any questions yes I've

843
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,330
thought about that because I did that

844
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,400
was at least one of when I was tweaking

845
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,529
as I said I do this all that I did for

846
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,360
my advanced group I actually set up a

847
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,220
CTF with flags and I was thinking I

848
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,470
could set that up to do you know to

849
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,790
create like 10 just set it up so it's an

850
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,819
option you could do it to make 10

851
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:58,560
blacks or something as opposed to and so

852
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,940
you know you only put 10 in Boehner

853
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,200
abilities and have 10 flags there's

854
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,290
something like that or a number you say

855
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,609
or a specific set I was thinking about

856
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,600
doing that because I've done it I've

857
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:09,090
done the tweaking

858
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:13,529
I like the modifying one of my apps to

859
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:16,290
do it so so it would be not too hard to

860
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:19,050
them look at what I did and put it in

861
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:22,800
here but it's not one of my immediate

862
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:27,300
goals but maybe I can see why I'm doing

863
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:30,300
it before September which is when I

864
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,700
teach next time again so I plan on I

865
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,580
actually probably will get actual work

866
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,750
time in August where I can work on this

867
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:42,690
because I'll be working on what I'm

868
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:44,550
teaching so that'll be good but yes I

869
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,570
love that idea and I'm hope I think I

870
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:48,750
will put on my listening event

871
00:40:45,570 --> 00:41:08,400
definitely want to do anyone else

872
00:40:48,750 --> 00:41:11,250
yep so the options are actually there

873
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,660
mostly you could completely change them

874
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,250
out without changing the source code

875
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,220
because they're actually all in outside

876
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,720
data and yes it would be I think yeah I

877
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,459
probably be good to put up a nice

878
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,720
interface that someone can actually just

879
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,570
select from them but yeah they're all

880
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,270
actually so you can out and outside data

881
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:29,010
some of them are text files like the

882
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,750
username and password lists or like that

883
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,900
so you can add to them if you wanted to

884
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,430
have different subsets and that's our

885
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,750
thing so it's all just data and none of

886
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:40,169
it's actually in the source code the

887
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:43,740
options so and it would be really easy

888
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:49,760
to set that up it's just um as I said

889
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:52,740
it's the easy things I skipped but yes I

890
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,860
I really should do that I was planning

891
00:41:52,740 --> 00:42:02,209
on doing that thank you

892
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:02,210
I'll try to get it done anyone else

893
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:09,500
all right well thank you guys for coming

894
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:11,509
and if anyone was a Mad Libs play with

895
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,030
please I think I'm making that

896
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:18,160
conference more fun

897
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:18,160
no one yay

898
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,379
