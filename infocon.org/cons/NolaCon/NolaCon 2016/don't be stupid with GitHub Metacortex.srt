00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:25,130
insulting their threat analyst and
consultant pen tester all that stuff I

6

labs I and Stage four so anywhere
somebody wants to let me stand on stage

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,690
and talk to people I will do that so
there's lots of the places that I've

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,500
been lately so real quick rules of
engagement for today

10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:02,370
be informal don't be afraid to yell out
right there thank you Michael I will

11
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,020
acknowledge you but don't expect a witty
comeback it is a little early in the

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:13,080
morning so what are we going to be
talking about today finding all the

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,320
stupid shit people put on github and
harvesting as much of that as humanly

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,369
possible

15
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,170
generally like to start out with a nice
little story about a girl I dated in

16
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:33,460
high school and sexually that one not
that one in case you were wondering and

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,169
we don't talk too much these days so
randomly this is not an actual screen

18
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:46,600
shot but she decides to text me out of
the blue and says he has a going and I

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,119
actually did not have your number in my
phone anymore so the first thing I do

20
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,409
see what Google has on this number

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,089
ur first page there's not a lot of
interesting results

22
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,300
aggregated data on phone records I get
to the second page and was about ready

23
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,959
to give up very down there the bottom
with some something interesting I wanted

24
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,730
to check out so we'll blow it up for you
guys in the back and their personal

25
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,640
information name phone number mailing
address neighborhood that she lived in

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,790
oh well good thing I know who this
number is now let's check out this file

27
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:44,019
photo Jason dumb ok everything's all in
a single line with the expanded out to

28
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:52,670
the blog version and holy shit so again
let's blow it up for those in the back

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:01,200
you can check out some of this
information I'll do it for you as a

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,339
whole bunch of stuff you know phone
numbers names emails actual details of

31
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,310
people's apartments

32
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:19,630
room number size of rooms they did some
hard core data analytics on this and

33
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:31,910
1,800 people in their awesome so at this
point I was not gonna text back my ex

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:39,170
girlfriend I figured I probably should
just to let her know that all her shots

35
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:46,018
out there and she actually she text back
and said thanks for letting me know that

36
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:53,230
good to know and what happened was that
was Jason file people were using to

37
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,608
coordinate rooms forerunners of the
Boston Marathon the bombs went off

38
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:07,829
pretty noble cause sure but how long ago
was that now still there and I can tell

39
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:15,750
you at least one person's information is
absolutely correct it that's my initial

40
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,380
and true to all of the stupid shit
people put on and then a couple of

41
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:27,330
months ago I saw this Tweet come by but
weren't relying on Twitter and Mark

42
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,039
Burnett he does a lot of password stuff
he wrote the secret password book from

43
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,930
Salt Lake City as well so it's all this
week said really better than 80 million

44
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:45,710
passwords WordPress com things seriously
you you can't be raised and pure shit

45
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,650
there's a bunch of them that when it
came to 887 million returned results

46
00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:00,289
they started checking in and sure enough
there is an example right there

47
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,660
backseat season credentials air

48
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,560
digging in to get up and trying to
figure out what more is out here because

49
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,450
there's obviously more shit so I learned
everything is illogical and in the

50
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,880
search field they strip away all special
characters like they'd probably be

51
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,419
should be and they do a lot of keywords
like Google Dorking so you can string a

52
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:37,370
bunch of the key words together to find
interesting so you're looking for in

53
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,260
this example we can use filename passwd
that it's easy to find people at the

54
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
password files

55
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,710
digging around trying to think of a
whole bunch of cool shit that you can

56
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,229
find and there's a list of the most
interesting

57
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,070
tons of keys everywhere

58
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,100
password chip shadow files SFTP configs
which are a lot of fun because you know

59
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,200
when they have publicly accessible
eighties those are generally the real

60
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:18,320
credentials to get in sync with Gmail
SMTP confidence richard is you can log

61
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,099
into people's gmail accounts potentially
an AWS crabs which still to this day I'm

62
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,880
trying to find creds to a GPU instance
in AWS because free cracking would be

63
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:44,060
amazing so let's check out some of these
here so here you know private keys

64
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:54,520
interesting there four point six million
of them returned and that result I said

65
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:06,030
earlier at sea password files 1100 ish
kinda fun shadow files a lot less than

66
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:14,010
they had see passwords yes the teepee
configs are you saying there's not a

67
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,659
thing public in that screenshot but no
roots and owes its tough after digging

68
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,820
around a little bit then decided he
somebody could probably write something

69
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,370
to grab all of that because that would
be fun right

70
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:38,569
and that night I kinda did and that's
pretty much exactly how it went so by

71
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:43,949
the morning I had a very basic working
version of my tool

72
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:53,800
harvester which ironically I am posting
on get home because why not so what does

73
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,830
it do really well be false

74
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:03,369
making it easy don't have to give it any
config flags or any of that you can't

75
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:08,649
you want but they do you feel this run
the Python script and a bunch of

76
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,369
WordPress config files parts of them out

77
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:18,059
well it grabs the config files purses
and and dunks username password data

78
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:24,969
base host and I think something else I
can remember but themselves on the

79
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:25,498
screen

80
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:31,849
really easy for you and you can start
logging into people's stuff if you want

81
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,370
not condoning and and later I started
writing additional features into it

82
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,209
where you can do custom get home
searches custom regex on all the results

83
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:51,119
so if you want to get more interesting
results you can totally do that right

84
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:05,839
all the files to disc to screen so now
is the fabled demo time you can see that

85
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:34,100
script you just go ahead and just run
that and say there's life threads

86
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,550
fantastic just going to keep as many as
it finds

87
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:53,319
generally when I like to give the stop
this is the moment where I asked for

88
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,160
audience participation does anyone want
to try to ease and verifies that they're

89
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,160
working now

90
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,800
ok is it fun sorry though I was doing
this in front of InfraGard in Salt Lake

91
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:18,229
because everybody was like shocked by
the time I was done the local agent

92
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:24,960
walks up to me so I really like you
present here a little edge to it we

93
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:41,060
don't normally get so pretty flattering
but some other stuff so this command

94
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,640
quick

95
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,120
so what it's doing is it's using the
packets flag looking for filename eye Dr

96
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:02,220
ste actually doing regex on begin RSA
key so because I'm doing regex right now

97
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:10,190
it's just gonna dump the match regex to
the screen there is a key there's a

98
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:20,320
there's a key be like oh brother here
sometimes he'll get a private key so the

99
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:29,890
show you that I am totally full of shit
but don't put bunch of these she's real

100
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,430
quick for fantastic

101
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:58,079
it was created as a whole bunch of bull
straight up keys that's fucking

102
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
show you some other stuff

103
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:28,960
files don't believe that the screen so
controversial shop is pretty fun Diego

104
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:52,920
that read this earlier I don't know if
it's working or not but for so many

105
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:05,469
people can fix passwords in this one but
if he wanted the full files we could do

106
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,270
that as well so pretty awesome as you a
lot of password passwords as you would

107
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:22,740
expect that to change due 2013 fantastic
doesn't look like that got changed

108
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:44,240
on its face so about the tail end of
March I decided to poll as much data as

109
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,709
I couldn't figure out how to lose a
little snapshot of everything I was able

110
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:54,029
to find out there and those are all my
numbers everything in print the seas

111
00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:02,930
were all unique so was it sixty one
database credentials for public posts so

112
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:09,439
all of those where you know freely
accessible to log into you know if

113
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,649
you're looking to spread those that the
good list of sites to elicit I friends 2

114
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:29,279
I'm not condoning anything but yeah 1400
1400 public safety people's building up

115
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,759
there you go

116
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:39,160
great way to do that and then the actual
the the best ratio that I found was the

117
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:48,410
democrats as far as unique credentials
go and I like you know because again

118
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,850
you're not going to find too much
variance on but

119
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,250
gmail crowds are actually an interesting
because she's a great job

120
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,779
about handling your password so if you
try and login from your Gmail account

121
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:12,079
from an IP address you have not logged
into it yet but it'll give you a little

122
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:22,519
know he is a new AP when I get you an
interview confirmed but you will not

123
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:29,279
even get to that screen unless those
creds our ballot so is good way to test

124
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,699
for crimes without actually committing
any crimes

125
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,950
who do some analysis on all the good
stuff that I was able to find within all

126
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,510
those results so a lot of blank
WordPress passwords of course root

127
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:59,100
password and press but there were some
funny ones actually and so krieger is my

128
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,570
spirit animal so I had to involve the
picture

129
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:16,180
yeah office here he informed me last
time I saw him last password on the

130
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:24,319
bottom is not iowa pain it's some weird
sexual fetish thing on the internet so I

131
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,590
was hoping he was going to be here to
shine light on that again so for the

132
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:38,730
SFTP passwords actually they were the
most complex the bunch which is

133
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,570
fantastic you know your friends

134
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,810
logging directly into the server but if
you put them out onto the internet clear

135
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:54,729
text it doesn't matter how fucking long
they are there's a bunch of fun ones in

136
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:02,060
this one my favorite absolutely is
pizzaiolo swag which I actually had to

137
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,060
change my password after I saw that

138
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:13,060
I like turtles goodbye world I hope that
server still up because that would be

139
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:25,250
sad couple of dirty words some of the
fund Gmail passwords that people want to

140
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:40,760
choose their place at 10 underscore
written out 123 and then actually Dr

141
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,700
Cassar

142
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,710
not portraying that but that actually
doesn't go to a doctor

143
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:57,350
asar which was really interesting I
don't know it was just some random gmail

144
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,840
account that you know I did a little bit
of recon on and not a doctor

145
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:11,320
shadow file and you know all of the
major passwords so with the shadow files

146
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,929
actually took all the hashes and threw
them into an AWS CPU instance has cat

147
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:26,000
just what I was able in about 12 hours
to crack about 60 percent of them with

148
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,010
the word list that was about 1.5 million
unique passwords that I've been

149
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,230
harvesting from public sources

150
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:47,530
standard but some of the fun ones so
only for you to see not so much the one

151
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:53,149
that I had to highlight was God because
I was actually in writing these slaves

152
00:18:53,150 --> 00:19:05,830
fairly early in the night going god
wouldn't be up this late sorry so I

153
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,850
decided to compile everything and do a
basement every single password that I

154
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,590
came across when I was running this the
end of March 31 him there you go

155
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:21,659
actual legitimate creds used in the wild
they don't come with usernames or

156
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:30,650
passwords but I mean nothing's better
for cracking and actually using words

157
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:38,730
there's a couple concerns that I
actually ran into law

158
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:45,940
writing this script so there is an
option to use get home the API but it's

159
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,290
kind of useless because it returns the
exact same manner of results that the

160
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,340
Web Site does it's only one thousand
results

161
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:02,420
10 results per hundred pages and there
is some kind of KB article somewhere

162
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,870
that I found where they said we're only
gonna return it doesn't results because

163
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,850
if they're returning a couple million
results perhaps it's going to destroy

164
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:20,590
their servers which makes sense so I
started trying to find ways to massage

165
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,149
more results out of it and I found the
order by options on the website order by

166
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:32,760
their own best match recently indexed
and last recently index of course I

167
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,850
wrote a little flat and that you can
specify any one of those are all three

168
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,570
at the same time and potentially get
three thousand results

169
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:49,770
and practice I generally get about 1500
unique that aren't overlapping but it's

170
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,740
not too bad

171
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,520
another concern is if you hit their
server fast enough you will get this

172
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:08,300
little dialogue box says hey not gonna
fuck off go away come back as we look

173
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:15,159
funny thing about this is if you're
running my tool and doing regex

174
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,140
the results it is just low enough to
avoid that

175
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,219
not by design

176
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:34,280
totally coincidental but I'll take it
and as kind of a quick chat up to this

177
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:40,430
guy who keeps a list of get home dorks
I've never met him he's somewhere on

178
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:46,120
another continent but there were a
couple things that he had in there that

179
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,070
I wasn't aware of the Gmail creds most
of them are a dirty found out but

180
00:21:52,070 --> 00:22:00,840
there's some good stuff in there so
definitely check out that repo and then

181
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:09,310
new features since they've written this
slide generally when I get to my

182
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:15,200
question and answer section people
always say hey what if I wanted to

183
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,140
search the Civic repositories where I
knew all my developers were using get

184
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:27,050
here is all their usernames I said that
that would be actually really useful and

185
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:31,169
I'm just writing dick Tomey Internet

186
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:37,830
so they did that the other day and I
actually just pushed it up to get a

187
00:22:37,830 --> 00:23:06,010
couple of minutes before starting so say
we are way but say what you want to do

188
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:29,390
so and see which one because we have
that Olympic rower passport files but

189
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:42,460
say and this guy share Andrew we will
call him from moscow so let's say he's

190
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,640
one developer them a potentially work
for me to make sure that it's not being

191
00:23:48,640 --> 00:24:17,300
retarded on get into a passport files
and a or account account there no

192
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,860
only one page of results and obviously
it doesn't work

193
00:24:32,970 --> 00:25:19,880
bridge don't think that's what we should
be getting new features stream right so

194
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:28,260
many tools broken fantastic
congratulations right time to

195
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:36,170
troubleshoot that tonight and rolled it
back so that's coming soon

196
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:59,000
the functionality is mostly there but if
I get so there is where my so a free

197
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,830
account when it works then P for project
so if you know the civic projects are

198
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:11,740
working on you can also dial it down
into that which could be very useful

199
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:20,850
right questions

200
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,439
guys have been a lively bunch today so I
imagine there's going to be thousands

201
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:36,860
know right so there's all my contact
information so if you want to reach me

202
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,580
on Twitter at all

203
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:44,350
pay my phone whenever you hit so hit me
however long you want it borders ended

204
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,260
periods early in the morning drive my
girlfriend not or if you wanna talk

205
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:59,760
consulting stuff there's only details so
other than that thank you very much and

206
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,740
I don't think we actually have a speaker
next because they never checked in the

207
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:10,610
car ever so that's all for me thank you
very much
