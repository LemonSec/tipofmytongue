1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,390
between and about a dozen ok let's go
ahead and start my name is Joseph

2
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,530
premium director technical services for
PSE TSC is aqsa company in other words

3
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,430
we work in the PCI regulatory compliance
and I run the team of penetration

4
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:49,340
testers about 10 of us at PSC as well as
working with the princess group now our

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,789
testers work towards highly complex
inside a highly complex environments

6
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:00,710
typically inside of enterprises level 1
clients with hundreds of servers and

7
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,689
thousands of endpoints and usually
hundreds of billions in fact two of them

8
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:11,389
are here today and they'll be talking
tomorrow the content high-value targets

9
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,210
in corporate environments and that
should be a really good talking to get a

10
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,610
chance to do it because it'll give you
scenarios that we're likely to see as

11
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,229
penetration testers at this level now in
addition to being the director I'm also

12
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,320
published published vulnerability
researcher and I spend about 20 percent

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,600
of my time in the field as well I get
the travel all over the world hacking

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,059
networks and speaking to clients have
been able to speak in at the PCI Council

15
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,439
meetings and in front of card brands all
over the world now if I'm honest I'm not

16
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,020
as good as those guys I'm not as good as
the rest of my team and I don't have to

17
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,789
be because I'm the manager I just get to
hire and encourage really good pen

18
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,759
testers

19
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,290
that's what we're talking about today is
how do you make that break from being a

20
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,530
guy that really loves pen testing wants
to do it as a job how do you get that

21
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,140
big break how do you go from CTF to
hacking the enterprise

22
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,769
do you have the necessary skills you
know where do you get them if you don't

23
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,610
then what are the mistakes that new guys
in the field

24
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:27,530
typically make a show of hands real
quick how many of you are already been

25
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:39,730
testers cool and how many of you want to
be sure how many of you management as

26
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,049
anybody in here in a management role ok
cool then we won't discuss that slide

27
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:55,650
alright so up some of you might being
currently sysadmin right over year

28
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,330
developers are you have exposure to read
teams and you're thinking I really want

29
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,340
to do this is something that I love but
I'm already doing capture the flag she

30
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,790
may be involved in the room next door
and having a lot of fun with it you want

31
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,959
to make that jump to the professional
pen tester so what is a pen test let's

32
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,060
talk about that first because there's a
lot of different descriptions and

33
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,920
everybody needs to kind of get a feel
for what that looks like a pen test can

34
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,500
be roughly defined the practice of
testing computer systems with the

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,540
following steps you do discovery you do

36
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,100
enumeration you do vulnerability
assessment finding you do exploitation

37
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,920
now at PSC we take exploitation to the
next step we take what we exploited we

38
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,940
determine what position ran and then we
move laterally and vertically we go for

39
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,640
post exploitation

40
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,410
extra step that I don't see a lot of pen
test reports so if this is all I need to

41
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,640
know as a pen tester I should be pretty
well set right i mean you can go out you

42
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,440
can find these resources for these sort
of things I mean discovering

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,560
enumerations gotta be nmap Nessus and
you can figure out the rest of the right

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,769
not quite so

45
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:16,180
these are the real steps to the pen test
the first it always starts it doesn't

46
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,060
matter if you're a consultant or if
you're working inside an organization

47
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,430
there's always stopping the RFP
somebody's come to you and said we want

48
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,250
to do a pen test and you say ok let's
talk about what your objectives are

49
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,780
let's talk about the resources and what
we're going to need to put together then

50
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,820
you gotta come back and write the
proposal don't you got to deliver this

51
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,060
to the client so you've got to outline
what your methodology is not your

52
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,500
expertise is and you've got to be able
to provide this to the third party and

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,100
again it doesn't matter of Mrs
independent consultant or you're having

54
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,870
to bring this to management internally
there's still some concept of writing

55
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,080
the proposal then there's the sales
close which is simple if you're a

56
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,979
consultant you know how to do that if
you're inside you still have to sell it

57
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,640
to somebody because to somebody in the
organization is going to be unclear on

58
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,770
why they have to do it and what needs to
be done and then once you saw the

59
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,789
congratulations to start with the
kickoff meeting in his consultant you're

60
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,700
going to participate in what it takes to
do the test setting up the logistics

61
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,170
agreeing on the rules of engagement
making sure that we understand we all

62
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,550
agree on what is success criteria
success criteria is the point at which

63
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,510
you stop at what point are we done with
the penitents and then when you've

64
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,099
agreed to all of that there's the actual
test and now you can start going through

65
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,340
the discovery the enumeration
vulnerability assessment exploitation

66
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,000
and post exploitation and you're done
with the pen test now you've gotta write

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,970
the report and that this is an internal
tests as opposed to consultant you still

68
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,570
have to write it up for somebody then
you're gonna have to deliver that report

69
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,480
and it may be a delivery over a phone it
might be in person you may have to go

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,890
through some PowerPoint presentation but
you're gonna have to explain to somebody

71
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,919
what the findings are articulate but
those risks are and then give them some

72
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,820
idea of how to fix it and more than
likely the last step in the pen test is

73
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,040
helping them fix things they're gonna
come back to you and say well we

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,370
understand what Indian

75
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,020
ESAs but we don't know how to fix your
having a hard time getting an unresolved

76
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,109
or we don't know what to do about this
finding of inadequate segmentation what

77
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,130
are we supposed to do with that so again
you're gonna have to work with the

78
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,960
internal asset or what the client to
make sure that your pen test and all of

79
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,820
the steps are carefully and properly
articulated now there are different

80
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,949
types of Penn testers you may be
currently and I hope no one in the room

81
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:58,070
is the script kiddie we all know is the
guy in the forum who's begging us to

82
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,570
teach him how to hack Facebook and he
doesn't have any understanding of the

83
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,990
underlying technology or the
consequences of what he's doing he's got

84
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,760
some stripped off of wherever and he saw
a YouTube video you know that guy that

85
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,400
just got busted for hacking into some
government agency learned about it too

86
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,469
did it and then filmed himself hacking
and posted on online only got busted

87
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,610
because that's his mentality just
doesn't understand what's going on now

88
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,479
the junior pen tester is the guy that
knows the tools and has an understanding

89
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,849
of the underlying technology what they
don't have maybe his exposure to all the

90
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:42,389
different enterprises or technologies
may be there really experienced its ETF

91
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,810
but they've never sat in an environment
where there are you know

92
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,760
hundred assets and they're having to pit
through different VLANs to get to

93
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,969
wherever their target systems are never
experienced that but they're pretty good

94
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,789
they've got a good understanding and
they're fairly careful now the mid-range

95
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:04,849
pen tester these are the guys I love
because they're seasoned they know the

96
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,849
tool you know they might news know how
to do sequel injection manually but they

97
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:14,440
use all the tools to speed things up so
sequel maps easy they're qualified to be

98
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,289
a team leader and they're going to be a
successful as a consultant or internally

99
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,460
within an organization know the
difference between a mid-range 1010

100
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,729
tester and a senior pentagon stir in my
mind is this the senior pen tester

101
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:32,990
someone who's writing new tools and
techniques and researching

102
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,919
vulnerabilities and mentoring other team
members that really what makes you

103
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:44,510
senior and above just everybody else now
not everybody is willing to go through

104
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,200
the steps it takes to go from strip
kitty the senior pen tester I don't know

105
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,339
if you saw this the other day on reddit
stacking somebody was looking for damn

106
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,270
hell he was in the hacking subreddit he
was having a real problem because

107
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:08,050
everybody was telling him stuff to do
that was totally useless shit and the

108
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,640
tutorials that he was finding raw crappy
and heat he couldn't figure out how to

109
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,589
do it he just needed some help and
somebody needed to tell them how to do

110
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:21,860
it well this is probably an extreme
example but it's not an uncommon

111
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,010
attitude where we want to get to the end
as quickly as possible we want to cut

112
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,520
out the middle and you're not likely to
start packing by jumping right in you

113
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,839
probably need to do something else in
the industry first right yet developed a

114
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,029
sysadmin do something so that you can
get exposure to the technologies of the

115
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,410
programs and the applications that you
actually gonna have to break into its

116
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:54,560
not wasted time or experience and this
background will go a long way so let's

117
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,109
talk about the skills you need to have
so basic computer skills and I say basic

118
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,529
is is probably should have broad
computer skills you should be an expert

119
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,750
in at least one operating system but you
need to be operating system agnostic you

120
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,329
may love winik's all day long think
everything else sucks but you might like

121
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,479
them back and think everything else is
just garbage but the fact of the matter

122
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,570
is the Enterprise Linux Windows so you
better know it and you better know how

123
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,190
they set it up and how they use it in
the enterprise so that means Active

124
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,610
Directory that means exchange that might
mean SharePoint and a lot of other

125
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,579
different window systems you may even at
some point have exposure to mainframes

126
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,329
unfortunately we can grab a mainframe
through an elaborate home and hack away

127
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,849
at it but at some point if you do get
the chance you can do it

128
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,940
slowly and carefully and expose yourself
to that sort of thing you need to

129
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,069
understand what's going on in a network
level PCP for v4 and v60 gonna have to

130
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,529
be able to open up Wireshark and
understand what's going on to make heads

131
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,449
or tails of the output and understand
the most common networking protocols

132
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:09,040
scripting skills you need to have it in
their own do you want to have it it

133
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,839
makes your life a lot easier you can
automate you can do get a lot more done

134
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,410
in the same amount of time if you can
get them back on Windows back you're

135
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,579
going to need to know the databases you
if you're looking at a single injection

136
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,300
you have to know how those back in
databases are working so Ms sequel

137
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,019
mighty cool post parade Oracle get some
exposure to it

138
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,850
Internet programming skills like HTML in
that job at a salon it's all there

139
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,389
ColdFusion you've gotta get some
exposure to it fortunately again all of

140
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:44,410
this is easy to get our hands on and
bring down you'll need more advanced

141
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,630
programming skills there is always the
argument of you should I learn Python or

142
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,160
Perl better work is Ruby better than
everything and I don't care what you

143
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,130
decide to do again the flexibility is a
little bit different but once you learn

144
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:09,990
wanted to make the other is easier than
wireless deals have to understand how if

145
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,480
you have not cracked WEP wireless might
now I not even as as an entry level

146
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,339
person that's one of the easiest things
to do and I'll be your next step to

147
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:27,040
working towards wpa2 WPA or wpa2
enterprise now how do you know that

148
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,449
you've got enough in terms of skill set
to be able to do the job well I'm gonna

149
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,910
share something with you I have these
skill matrix spreadsheets that I use

150
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:44,880
with my guys will not provide them to
them so they can go through an answer

151
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,269
how they know the different tools and
I've broken up the spreadsheets based on

152
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,350
the steps of a pen test for both the
internal and the external and they can

153
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,360
answer the questions do I know
disturbing enumeration as well as they

154
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,730
should

155
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,000
an expert and this this tool and it
gives me an idea as the manager of where

156
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,029
I can use them in an engagement and it
also gives them as the employee an

157
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,939
opportunity to say okay well you know
what I'm a little weak in this maybe I

158
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,079
need to improve my skill set so I'm
sharing these with you now they're up on

159
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,959
the 10th esta playing and then I'll move
them over to my get home and you can

160
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,099
download these and take a peek and see
if you can use them now if you can if

161
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,899
you can add stuff to this and you can
improve upon these spreadsheets by all

162
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,029
means let me know because I'd be
interested in that that feedback now the

163
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:40,000
mechanics of being a pen tester learning
the tools and the programs and the

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,870
applications

165
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,620
fortunately is easy to get our hands on
it's all over the net and it doesn't

166
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,720
cost anything

167
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,970
most of the resources that are available
on the internet are free and everything

168
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,829
we need to know we can usually get our
hands on I've gone ahead and put

169
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,540
together a web page but people keep
asking me how do I become a pen tester

170
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,370
so I threw this together and it's
available for you again a pen tester

171
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,910
tips getting started guide HTML when you
can go here and take a look at it and

172
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:20,170
it's got resources ranging from you know
like CD distributions to test labs

173
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:26,000
different vulnerable applications that
you can tear apart methodologies and so

174
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,970
on and so forth

175
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:33,510
things that you can use at home to
practice and fill in wherever you might

176
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:40,720
have some weak spots now one of things I
like to make a point here and we can use

177
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,160
me as an example you can learn all of
this but i dont program is it because

178
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,319
programming is hard

179
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,060
it's because I'm frankly not willing to
put the time and energy into learning

180
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,550
how to program I haven't had too and now
the manager I can just look at Josh for

181
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,439
Patrick I used to look at Victor and say
hey to this morning but the point is

182
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,190
that if you're willing to put the time
and effort into this its you can become

183
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,810
an expert in this if you're like our
little reddit guy that we saw earlier

184
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,510
you'll never get anywhere with this
attitude but just a little attention and

185
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:26,090
passionate this and you can go quite far
the question comes up a lot of times do

186
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,590
I need to search do you need to
certainly a pen tester we've got the CIA

187
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,580
security plus we've got you see council
stuff we've got the OS CD from offensive

188
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:43,600
security saying just got all their
surgeons and then probably about a half

189
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,630
a dozen other certifications out there
and do you need it

190
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:53,630
the answer is maybe you might a lot of
organizations for example the Department

191
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,350
of Defense directive 8140 requires that
you have at least some of the EC Council

192
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,260
certification so that you can
demonstrate different levels of

193
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,890
competency are they going to make you a
better pen tester probably not but the

194
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:14,290
job requires saying what the CISSP what
is the CISSP it's about an inch deep in

195
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,540
a mile wide when it comes to security
and if you have a CISSP like you do does

196
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,689
this make you a better pen tester hell
no but it does let me be things like PCI

197
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,980
QSA pH USA it would allow me to get
certain jobs in the organization in the

198
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,440
field because the enterprise ask for a
lot of times you could negotiate this

199
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,380
you can say look out that the CISSP but
if you hire me I promise to get it

200
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,640
within six months and some organizations
are willing to do that so I don't

201
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,360
dismiss certifications I think about
most of my guys have them and some of

202
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,600
them do and that's great

203
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,720
really for me it what you can do in our
org

204
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,779
but don't dismiss them because many
companies and organizations will require

205
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:05,079
a

206
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,569
in addition to the mechanical aspects of
packing in pen testing for those other

207
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:17,109
skills that you need to have the soft
skills so if we remember that list we

208
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,289
went through that wasn't about discovery
enumeration vulnerability assessment and

209
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:28,459
so for these are where the soft skills
come in writing communication parents

210
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,280
when you're working with clients

211
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:37,200
professionalism curiosity and passion
skill that you definitely have to have

212
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,559
here so let's talk about communication
my boss says we were given two ears and

213
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,980
one mouth for a reason and his point of
this may be to tell me to shut up but

214
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,289
the other point is that communication
starts with listening that's the most

215
00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:01,010
important part and if you need to
improve your listening skills stop

216
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:06,900
talking speak less don't interrupt
somebody when they're talking and you

217
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,929
you you know the answer you and your
almost already there you've already got

218
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,710
their question completely done and you
want to go ahead and give the answer

219
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,090
real quick it's really tempting to kind
of jump in and drop them but the fact is

220
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,840
that you're not listening

221
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,178
wait for the entire question try and
keep eye contact is difficult for some

222
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:30,480
of us but it's it's an active part of
listening so that you can see the

223
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,080
emotional content that they're
delivering not just the words and that

224
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,809
focus on the message try not to get tied
up in anything it makes you feel a lot

225
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:42,908
of times if you're working with the
sysadmin and you just told them that

226
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:48,080
something broken he's coming back at you
with his defense or something else and

227
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,100
you might get wrapped up in wanting to
defend yourself or argue with him and he

228
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,490
just gotta say no you know what I'm
focused on the message right from the

229
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,750
get down and then we'll continue going
and then

230
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,200
yeah I dot the beginner's mind set just
because you're a pen tester doesn't mean

231
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,000
you know everything in there are times
when in our communication between us and

232
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,170
the client we may dismiss them as they
they just don't get it you know I'm the

233
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,230
pen tester I got this they just don't
know and that can interfere with your

234
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,880
ability to really communicate with the
people that you're trying to articulate

235
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,530
risks with now you may find yourself in
situations where you have to speak in

236
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,620
front of audiences or work with small
groups of clients or even within your if

237
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,899
you're working internally on the red
team there may be a small group that you

238
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,830
have to sell an idea to do so if you're
not comfortable speaking in front of

239
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,540
people are stupid things that you can do
in the first thing you need to do is

240
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,510
practice just practice practice practice
and their different ways to do that if

241
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,129
you want to be able to get up in front
of everyone and talk you could join

242
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,750
Toastmasters which is an organization
that does nothing but constant public

243
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,490
speaking or you can do something simpler
if you're part of a religious

244
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,090
organization and you only on Sundays you
might volunteer to read from the book

245
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,040
and that's still an opportunity to put
yourself out there and speak in front of

246
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,020
a group so that you feel better about
the process and you're not as

247
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,440
uncomfortable the other part of
communication is writing and some of us

248
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,030
are really good at it and some of us are
but there are a lot of resources on the

249
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,139
web where you can go to improve that
you're familiar with the website for

250
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:32,040
Sarah dot com this is a website that
provides us with access to university

251
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:38,340
level classes and if you go to Coursera
. excuse me or and search for writing

252
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,370
there's about a half a dozen different
university classes that you didn't take

253
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,149
that will improve your professional
writing personal writing and so forth

254
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,040
and all of this again it's free so
there's no reason that we can't find the

255
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,399
resources and the opportunities to
improve our communication skills

256
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:06,629
now appearance the black hoodie we
please stop the black hoodie black

257
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:11,658
hoodie in the black fingernail paint all
of this this is not something that I can

258
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:17,749
put in front of a banker and it may
impact your professional credibility

259
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:23,379
let's face it now there's a point where
in your career you may get to a point

260
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:27,468
where you don't care anymore and they
can't argue with you because you are an

261
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:32,479
expert but if you're just breaking into
it and you walk into the office after

262
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:36,469
you've been hired in the whole hacker
persona with the hoodie shut off the

263
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,899
lights and you sit there

264
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:41,379
hacking you're not going to be very
successful in the career please stop

265
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:48,059
let's go ahead and consider this to be a
social engineering engagement right so

266
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,940
if we're working with bankers let's
dress like bankers let's see what was a

267
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,029
dual and do acts I think we were hearing
in the previous talk about burying the

268
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:04,459
people that we are socially attacking
and let's consider that lets play the

269
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:09,669
role that we've been put in to get rid
of this hacker persona because I don't

270
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:12,709
think it's benefiting us in any way
shape or form

271
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:17,829
professionalism the one is
professionalism

272
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:24,569
well it can be little things like being
prompt showing up to the meeting on time

273
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:28,819
and that can be a real challenge because
you might have been working overnight

274
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:33,908
and you just went to bed at six then
there's a real temptation this a spirit

275
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:37,789
they don't know I was up all night and
they give me this meeting at 8 a.m. and

276
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:44,319
you know why you know sometimes we just
have to do that and we have to be

277
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,369
prepared so showing up it is one thing
but showing a prepared for the meeting

278
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:51,468
is the other we need to see that when
your new oftentimes your little

279
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:57,449
scattered and you need to kind of not
slowed down a little bit make sure that

280
00:22:57,449 --> 00:23:00,039
you've got everything you need before
you walk in the room and get on the

281
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,440
phone

282
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,279
also means being confident without being
cocky now this is what I struggle with a

283
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,470
great deal is I it's really easy to go
over that edge of being confident to

284
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,929
being cocky and the reason I do it is
because I'm out of my depth I'm faking

285
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:24,480
it and I've gone from being dumped in it
too cocky and it's just something that

286
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,230
will work but it happens with a lot of
the people I work with a lot of the new

287
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,529
guys that come in are quite sure how to
do it so just be aware that this can be

288
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,279
a problem

289
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,700
organizational skills of your new I
gotta tell you can be working with a lot

290
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,259
of evidence one of the things that we do
is part of the penetration test as we

291
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:48,409
document our observations in a way that
we can reproduce what we did six months

292
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:52,350
later and if you're unable to do that
that could be a problem for you and for

293
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,168
your business in case something goes
pear-shaped and six months later you're

294
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:01,919
called to testify and that happens so
you need to be organized in need to keep

295
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,980
all of your evidence together and that
will also help you succeed

296
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,889
professionally as well

297
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:11,139
professionalism also means maintaining
your points

298
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:16,719
customers both internal and external
aren't always the happiest people in the

299
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,059
world sometimes you're going to do
something like not over a server for

300
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,330
lockout every single user during a
password test and they're going to come

301
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,240
out you with both barrels flaming

302
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,799
you need to take it you need to maintain
your poise maintain your your comment

303
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:39,990
your center and work through the problem
without pushing back at practice as well

304
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,820
but that's part of being accountable
when you screw up saying yeah you know

305
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,480
what I screwed up and if I'm a
professional I'm accountable and I'm

306
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,580
willing to accept my mistakes that also
be honest and have integrity because it

307
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,639
spent testers I think that's critical
were gonna see things a lot of things

308
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:03,168
we're gonna have access to a lot of
information millions of credit cards for

309
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,590
example my team on a regular basis

310
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,669
halves

311
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:13,140
access to millions and millions of
dollars worth of credit cards and one of

312
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,630
them decided to go row that would be bad
and the same thing is for you know PII

313
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:25,330
and IP we thought we were gonna have
access to things that you know we can't

314
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,710
share with other people and we have to
have that integrity to keep it to

315
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:37,640
ourselves now the last soft skill is
something that can't teach you and it's

316
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,090
either one of those things you either
have or you don't

317
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,949
but it's probably the number one
characteristic of a successful pen

318
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,310
tester it's that curiosity whose passion
that's good but curiosity i think is

319
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,510
number one i mean if you're ever walking
through this hotel and looking at a

320
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:01,370
network Jack going that goes I want to
what I can do with it or you look at the

321
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,620
problem

322
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,239
CTF or otherwise and think this is a
puzzle and I need to solve this that's

323
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,640
that curiosity thats that spark and if
you've got that will be great if you

324
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,860
don't and if you're looking for a
nine-to-five job where you're not having

325
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:25,139
to work this constantly you know maybe
go into forensics or some other

326
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,560
cybersecurity sort of feel perhaps done
testing isn't for you

327
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:40,310
alright so I get this alot I can't get a
job unless I have experienced I can't

328
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,270
get experience unless I get a job that's
the time and catch 22 right especially

329
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,690
when you're new in your breaking into a
new feel well it's time to get created

330
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,710
so let me tell you something when I
first started in the computers are used

331
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,880
to make my glasses for a living I didn't
have a lot of money for computer

332
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,910
equipment I had three little children
and just me and I couldn't figure out

333
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,700
how to get the money up for the MCSE
because back in the day that was the

334
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,090
thing you had to get everybody was
getting MCSE MCSA is wrong crowd but I

335
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,060
still wanted it and I wanted to do it
but I couldn't so I got this crazy ass

336
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,580
idea I went to the school district said

337
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,090
ok this is what I'm going to do I'm
gonna fix I'm gonna go to businesses I'm

338
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,139
gonna ask for their own equipment I'm
gonna fix it up and I'm going to donate

339
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,390
it to the schools all I need is a place
to work in a place to store and they

340
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,750
were great picture in the paper

341
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,409
small town now that was a big deal for
little while and I was doing this and

342
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,929
then they came to me and they said hey
we've got a better idea why don't you do

343
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:49,830
this is an adult education classes you
can teach adults ought to do this but no

344
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,840
idea but I said sure why not

345
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,678
and I started teaching adult time to do
this over about three years or so I got

346
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:02,840
enough experience doing this to go and
get a job as a sysadmin actually got a

347
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,269
job at a value added reseller and did
some sales and implementation and have a

348
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,570
lot of fun but it was that you know
let's make this stuff up as we go sort

349
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,200
of get creative

350
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,380
that got me here we can do the same
thing as Penn testers at some of the way

351
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,870
he could do that would be to volunteer
if you look around at this conference

352
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:29,449
there lots of volunteers here in some of
them have strong careers insecurity

353
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,690
independent testing why not volunteer
the b-sides or Derby come and gone or

354
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,990
get involved in one of these conferences
is a volunteer are you gonna get

355
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,409
immediate experience as a pen tester lol
but you're gonna meet a lot of pent

356
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:45,720
testers and you can be able to network
and you're going to be able to have the

357
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,919
opportunity to familiarize yourself with
different people in the industry and

358
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,460
that he can get involved with hackers
for charity that could be some directs

359
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,450
work where you're actually doing some
technical volunteering and then there's

360
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:09,880
a website called dub dub catch a fire
dot board that will set up volunteers

361
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,710
with different organizations and if you
do a search on it the last time I looked

362
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,519
there was an organization that was
looking for somebody to do a cyber

363
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,539
security analysis of their network and
they're looking for volunteers to do it

364
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,629
again

365
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,650
there may be some opportunities there
where you can go to the school district

366
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,980
in your town or you can go to a local
business or whatever and say hi I'm a

367
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,870
student in cybersecurity I'd like to
test your website for free or on doing

368
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,570
this and I'd like to take a look at your
network at no charge for your school

369
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,450
your church where ever look for an
opportunity to volunteer get involved in

370
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:53,320
that may give you some real world
experience now but Mounties here's an

371
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,120
idea now but abilities are a very good
way for me as a hiring manager to

372
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,899
determine whether or not your skill sets
are valuable enough when you haven't had

373
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,560
another job so here's the idea of
somebody has been willing to pay you for

374
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,840
a vulnerability that you found in their
website

375
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,780
those are key indicators for me the tell
me that you were able to follow the

376
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,629
rules the bug bounty so you can follow
rules of engagement because if you screw

377
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,670
up in one of those they won't pay you
and you can produce actionable results

378
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,080
because you have been documented in a
way that if they understood and they

379
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,669
could verify this is not a bad idea in
terms of being able to demonstrate that

380
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,790
you have some skills without having a
job so you don't have to quit your day

381
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:45,740
job to be able to prove that you can pen
test now put pornhub up on here because

382
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,860
they have a new bug bounty and I thought
it would be funny if I'm honest I went

383
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,169
for a little bit of shock value right
but I'm beginning to see some reports on

384
00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:00,000
Twitter that suggests perhaps their bug
bounty program is not as professional

385
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,280
and above board as we thought so

386
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:11,740
I take it back you know take a look at
it but be careful out there now

387
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,010
mentorship here's an idea now mentorship
can be a fast track to understanding our

388
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,270
industry to find a good mentor what I
suggest you look around at the people

389
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,170
maybe your volunteering at these
conferences like we talked about earlier

390
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,850
you gonna see a lot of folks find
somebody got a successful career that

391
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:35,340
has something that you'd like to add you
like to emulate and see if they would be

392
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,970
willing to be your meant or i mean they
can help you cut through all the crap so

393
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,520
you can learn from their mistakes and
you can kind of leverage their

394
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,639
experience and you can be successful
that much faster but they're not going

395
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,890
to tell you how to hack your gonna have
to work for it enters aren't there just

396
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,640
to give you all the answers they are
they're typically its relationship to

397
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,920
help guide you professionally not
necessarily give you the tips and tricks

398
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,920
on how the half although they may do it
but don't abuse your mentors and and

399
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,980
make sure that you're doing the work
first before you go to them with the

400
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,120
question now here's something I want to
talk about I want to talk about the

401
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,969
concept of your personal brand who you
are it's very easy now for us to put our

402
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,610
brand out on the internet from Facebook
to Twitter to all of the different

403
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,810
forums and so forth

404
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:31,070
what I want to warn you that you don't
want to mix your conference persona with

405
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,450
your professional persona this will come
back to bite you in the ass every single

406
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,450
time remember you are what you tweet

407
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,169
if you post racist comments or post
pictures displaying questionable

408
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,480
judgments you're putting your career at
risk

409
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,189
once it's on the internet it's there
forever so I was doing some research on

410
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,810
post APD are you familiar with the
software package for doing man in the

411
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,480
middle attacks against wireless and I
was having some trouble and I was

412
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,050
looking at this forum and there was this
guy in the forum reply to every answer

413
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:11,159
with some abuse is unhelpful or just
derogatory sort of comment

414
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,460
clearly didn't know I look back at his
profile he really didn't win shit he was

415
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,890
senior had been posting a gazillion
years but its answers were all

416
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:28,190
incredibly unhelpful now if he could
come to me and was trying to get hired

417
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,580
on the job and I look back at that I had
taken his resume and just put it at the

418
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,360
bottom of the pile I don't need prima
donnas I don't need people with bad

419
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,679
attitudes it's not about that this is a
community where we've been helping each

420
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,100
other for a long time I understand the
concept of the OSC P try harder and I

421
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:52,860
get that but don't be a dick about it
some people will come to me and go and I

422
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,409
have this you well we all have issues
were all kind of special this is

423
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,900
something unique about our industry that
most of us are a lot of us will have

424
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,290
social awkwardness or obsessively
focused interests are poor communication

425
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,230
skills

426
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,550
there was you know quite some time
there's been the debate about you know

427
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,730
is that why we're successful is that is
it is at our industry creates that'll be

428
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,300
drawn to it like moths to a flame and
I've met a lot of brilliant yet broken

429
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:29,220
people with all sorts of issues and you
know it's ok we're all a bit broken even

430
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:35,330
the normal poker broken it's just not as
obvious what you can do however is make

431
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,310
your challenges your strength so if
you're awkward in social situations

432
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:46,190
don't like making eye contact then you
know what don't take a consultant get

433
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,639
get something in the back room you know
where you don't have to work with the

434
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,159
team maybe even work independently there
are a lot of jobs in the industry and

435
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,299
just because we might be a little
different a little uncomfortable where

436
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,440
normal people might be it's not a
problem it will not stop us from being

437
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,440
successful in our careers

438
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:12,319
your resume real quick this is pretty
much when you're knew about all your

439
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,010
resume should have if you were still
have that objective section in the top

440
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,210
of your resume

441
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,820
get rid of it I know what your objective
is you want to be a pen tester everybody

442
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,770
knows that

443
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,270
let's get rid of that news summary
section instead maybe the top four

444
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,550
bullet points the highlights of your
career what you're really good out

445
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,170
whatever you want me to understand about
you immediately get rid of the injected

446
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:42,510
and get rid of bullshit terms like your
piece people person or you know team

447
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:48,040
player a problem-solver you have
excellent communication skills now you

448
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,500
know these are these are fluff learns
that really don't bring anything to it I

449
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,440
want to know what you can do I want to
know what your skills are if you're new

450
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,520
push that education certification
section if you happen

451
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:07,500
putting whatever work experience that
you were able to pull together if you

452
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,050
were able to leverage the opportunity
and a current position for example to do

453
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:17,900
more cybersecurity put that in your
resume volunteer whatever and then

454
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,130
lastly and you're still sections stop
putting in things that you were just in

455
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,080
the room for you know you've got those
like I like know why I know how to do

456
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,590
you know 2012 are to Active Directory
not really but I was around the guy that

457
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,570
knew how to do 2012 or two and you get a
lot of that on the resume and you might

458
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,850
be able to get through like the
recruiter with that shit but once you

459
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,430
start getting to the people who know
better you're going to get called out on

460
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:51,379
it so just put in what you know with
what you have now the interview process

461
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,570
is gonna go a little bit like this you
have a phone screen with a recruiter

462
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,250
they're going to ask you some technical
questions that they have no

463
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,300
understanding up but somebody wrote them
down for you

464
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:08,900
if you can answer the question do me a
favor look up the answer so that when we

465
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,520
go to do the technical interview I can
tell you if you got past the recruiter

466
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,400
but you couldn't answer one or two
questions I'm gonna ask you those

467
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,490
questions in the technical interview
because I want to see whether or not you

468
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:24,220
learn from your mistakes but you could
have in the technical interview of

469
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,529
verbal or written or practical pray for
a practical if you're new and you want

470
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,720
to get into this the practical is the
best way to demonstrate your skills when

471
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,060
you don't have job experience you may
have the opportunity to provide writing

472
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:44,110
samples if you haven't written up a pen
test report from one of your exercises

473
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,440
do that because you you can have
something delivered to them also

474
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,030
consider going back to your personal
brand and making sure that you're doing

475
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,020
professional blogging because this will
demonstrate your expertise as well as

476
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,540
your writing skills and you may have a
cultural interview with somebody who's

477
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,040
just gotta look at you for the fitness
can be more casual than me ask you how

478
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,759
is it working independently some ethics
questions but really it's just to see

479
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,480
whether or not you can join the team and
find out where your gonna have that

480
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:24,320
final face-to-face interview negotiation
of your salary so now your pen tester

481
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:32,940
job way to go now where you gonna screw
up your new at this and it happens and

482
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,240
there's a few things that are pretty
common in new Ken testers I'm gonna tell

483
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,649
you about him now so you can avoid them
so the first one is I call it to 11 it's

484
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,240
where you've got a vulnerability and the
organization or the people you told

485
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,129
about it aren't getting it and they just
don't understand why it's a big deal and

486
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,860
you're getting worked up because it's a
big deal and they need to fix it and

487
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,280
they just don't understand

488
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,660
it's a problem and calm down there are
bigger things that play many times the

489
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,290
organization gets to choose whether or
not they want to fix it at the end of

490
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:14,310
the day it's up to them but one of the
things I want to do is take a step back

491
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:20,380
if your client or your stakeholders
isn't understanding then the problem may

492
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,750
be with the way that you are
articulating the risk to come out in two

493
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,810
different angle think about what's
important to them are they about the

494
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,600
money will then describe how this could
be about money and how it could cost

495
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,540
them come out of the slightly different
angle so that you can online what your

496
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:44,100
messages with what their interests are
you have a problem is saying yes when

497
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,330
you really mean oh so when you're like
yeah I can do that now that's perfect

498
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,529
yet totally know I got this its all good
and nodding her head yes one inside

499
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,130
you're thinking to yourself haven't a
clue I'm just gonna figure this out

500
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:03,070
later please don't do this you get to a
point where you're kind of reaching

501
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,890
outside your comfort zone and that's
okay but if you're way too far out in

502
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:13,950
our industry we we can possibly break
things and even when you've got some

503
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:18,689
time under your belt you can get to a
point where you're afraid to ask for

504
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:24,810
help I got I'm never had a hacker's
handle never been cool I got mine today

505
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:31,790
and it's called master challenge and it
comes from experience I had a client

506
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:37,300
where I was trying to move some files
over that I didn't have permissions to

507
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,940
move but to myself along just change the
permissions are used challenge and do

508
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,070
whatever and i ended up not really
knowing I was afraid to call anybody on

509
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,920
my team or to ask for help and i ended
up instead changing the permissions not

510
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,830
just those files but absolutely
everything on the web server and that

511
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,730
server went down and it was two days of
trying to figure out how to change

512
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,030
permissions back and what they all were

513
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,660
was pretty embarrassing and that's now
my cool hacker and the master chance so

514
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,370
I will always remember that even when
you've been doing this for a long time

515
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,750
you still need to ask for help

516
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:21,760
finally making mistakes gonna make it
it's just a fact of life so when that

517
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,230
happens just own up to it quickly I'd
rather somebody say hey I screwed up and

518
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,720
this is how I I figured out so it'll
never happen again and then cool that's

519
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,649
fine then we can move on to the problem
is that they're learning is a process

520
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,650
and there are four stages of learning
anything

521
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,160
the stages of competence right and the
most dangerous part when your new is

522
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,390
that you're in this stage of unconscious
incompetence meaning you don't know what

523
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,029
you don't know and you're there and you
just kind of wailing about a little bit

524
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:59,820
and then you move to the next stage
where now you're you're conscious and

525
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,150
competence now you know you're missing
some stuff and you know what that is and

526
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:10,410
you can go fix it and then he fixed it
in your conscious competence in yeah you

527
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,930
know what you may have to look at your
notes or Google something but you're

528
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:19,819
pretty good at it and you're OK and then
there's the unconscious competence where

529
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,080
you're like that senior pen tester where
you just rock and you can do it off the

530
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,009
top of your head

531
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,730
the learning process when your new
you're going to spend a lot of fun put

532
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,970
the time in unconscious incompetence
this is your most dangerous time but

533
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:37,399
eventually you're just gonna be in the
cycle of conscious incompetence through

534
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,060
unconscious competence where you're
gonna get really good then you're gonna

535
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,880
rock but our industry changes much
you're going to discover the something

536
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,430
that you don't know about when you're
going to get that urge to go figure it

537
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,589
out again and you're gonna move through
that cycle over and over and that's

538
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:58,120
probably one of the most exciting things
for me in this job and said there's

539
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,700
always something that I could learn
something I can I can do differently and

540
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,520
eventually I know that if I put the time
and energy into this career I will be

541
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,550
successful

542
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:17,320
and once on successful I think it's
important for us to give back we are

543
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:23,770
standing on the shoulders and people
that went before us i didnt right now I

544
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:31,060
didn't learn about Indian S&L eliminar
because I was like you know spider labs

545
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,450
and responder and all of these other
tools and techniques that we have

546
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,020
available freely given to us for the
most part I think it's important for us

547
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:45,640
as we succeed and as we get better to go
ahead and give back no prima donnas we

548
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,470
need to be willing to teach and we need
to make sure that we're not that guy in

549
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:57,810
the forum being a total pain in the ass
so you been a pen tester for a while so

550
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,820
what's next

551
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,200
well I got some sad news for you
probably management if you want to

552
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,370
advance there's a couple of different
ways that you can go as a pen tester you

553
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:13,759
can go into management it's not all that
bad but the other thing you could do is

554
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,370
be an owner and founder of your own
organization a lot of people who have

555
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:24,020
excelled at in our industry do that you
can always try the job hopping and and

556
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,000
hop around from company to company for a
while and see whether or not that make

557
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,480
you successful at some point that will
probably be detrimental as will start to

558
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,520
look at your resume and go six months
here you're there nine months there you

559
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,009
know guys not gonna be with us for very
long I'm not gonna investing you so

560
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:49,180
maybe this isn't a good match I mean
really the key to making more money is

561
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:55,569
pretty easy so pen testing as a fixed
cost right I can only bill X number of

562
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,700
dollars to a client per hour for the
work that you do so

563
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:05,880
your salary is basically defined as your
value to the company and that value can

564
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,420
be defined as your billable hours so
then you're can only deal so many hours

565
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:16,010
and we can only build the client so many
hours in a week and therefore I can only

566
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:23,339
pay you so much in a week or two about
you could also be associated by the

567
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:29,259
improvements you make to the the overall
company brain so maybe you're doing

568
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,280
talks

569
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,220
conferences or you're doing great number
of blog posts or you're creating tools

570
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:42,660
for your mentoring the the less senior
individuals on the team now now you've

571
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:49,529
changed your value from just a pure
billable let you can crank out to you

572
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,210
know what

573
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,950
intrinsic value you bring to the rest of
the organization and to the company

574
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:00,089
brand and that's a reason to be able to
go and ask for the race I know now more

575
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:05,220
valuable to you but basically you will
hit a point where management are gonna

576
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,939
have to figure out something else to do
and there's a lot for us to do in

577
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,260
cybersecurity let's face it so we can do
any one of these things in the list

578
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,330
forensics looks really interesting to me
because it's got a real strong tie in

579
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:22,400
with the pen testing so I like the
concept of red team vs Blue team working

580
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,710
together doing a little I don't know I
don't know we're gonna be and I hate

581
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,859
that question of where do we see
ourselves in five years but we've got to

582
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:33,250
ask ourselves out and be prepared for

583
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,730
I think if we follow some of those basic
steps I think it's relatively easy for

584
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:44,380
us to be able to go from the new guy
with the passion to the guy in the sea

585
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,640
kayaking in the enterprise and being
successful at it I know you guys have

586
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,900
got questions who wants to go first

587
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,190
yes sir

588
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:39,009
testers they can generally get a sense
of the guy on the other hand whether or

589
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,700
not he speaks the same language so
there's some value there I think it's a

590
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,830
there's another opportunity and as a
hiring manager that if you've got one of

591
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:53,369
your own guys interviewing potential
candidate and they're more likely to

592
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:58,900
sell the potential candidate on the
company that the candidates coming to

593
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,520
work for their their successful they're
happy if there's any questions from the

594
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,250
candidate they're more likely to answer
them in a positive way then recruiter

595
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:15,869
couldn't even in a management level sort
of and I generally typically rely on the

596
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:21,560
faces I hired them because of good I can
rely on them to do a fantastic job on

597
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,589
the field and I typically rely on them
to be able to to be a good judge someone

598
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:32,400
else's technical expertise any other
questions

599
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,400
yes sir

600
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:46,180
we are our use of Max is because our
company one of the first engagements we

601
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,149
did was with Apple so I guess during the
sales process they all walked in with a

602
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:55,279
combination of PHP sandals sat down at
the table and everybody else had Macs

603
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:59,569
and in that moment they went holy crap
this isn't gonna work and they went out

604
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:04,719
and bought max Alena Mac shop ever since
some of the advantages to me that

605
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,680
typically I can plug this into a
customer network and if there's a

606
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,640
problem on their network I will come
home with it if it infects one of my

607
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,999
BM's it's easy for me to wipe out it's
also tends to be a comfort level for the

608
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,729
customers well you've got a map ok
that's fine

609
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:30,609
there's not a lot you can do to my
network so then I think developers there

610
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:33,589
are some pretty good development tools
again he already said I'm not a

611
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:37,960
programmer so I couldn't tell you but I
know a lot of people yeah and you gotta

612
00:49:37,960 --> 00:50:10,609
kind of smashing indenting them and I've
actually gone through three hard drives

613
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:16,509
and I have to get this in now for its
third trackpad and the battery is dying

614
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:22,559
I'm either exceptionally hard on my
equipment or I've just had 11 for the

615
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:41,239
last three years and hear the questions
yes sir it's an enthusiasm in their

616
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:46,009
voice that excitement when they're
talking about a a particular issue

617
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:52,250
asking questions and whether or not they
give it an interesting thoughtful answer

618
00:50:52,250 --> 00:51:12,920
or they're not something just rolled out
of the book yes sir no reason why you

619
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,440
couldn't start a little

620
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,920
hackers chapter like I said you gotta
get creative

621
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:25,440
there might be some online resources
that you can you can go to IRC and

622
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,750
others that would be something you can
look to see if there's a B Sides

623
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,260
anywhere close to your community

624
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:40,820
any sort of maker spots even the chapter
tool that can be useful to try and find

625
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,000
similarly minded individuals who might
wanna get together on a regular basis to

626
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
talk shop

627
00:51:53,250 --> 00:52:00,680
you guys in a great audience i really
appreciate your time thank you
