1
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,720
much better

2
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,180
alright I thought I turned out ok good
morning sorry couple minutes late just

3
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,129
for me to figure out how a computer
actually works best companies do not

4
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:47,210
know how technology works so this is
this is a fun little talk that I'm

5
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,339
really happy when given it's kind of a
shame that asshat who plays for first

6
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:57,390
was in that black hat movie and then he
was in a Moby Dick movie as well so no

7
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,479
matter what I can't seem to escape the
the peril of that particular actor

8
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,979
forget his name at this moment which
shows you how much gary have been any

9
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,158
event at the final talk about whaling
and take a look at some really really

10
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,560
interesting aspects and I think one of
the most exciting and I can only say

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,189
that as a consultant as an investigator
if a business it's not an exciting

12
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,100
campaign whatsoever they are previous
consulting me does not let you get away

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,548
with an agenda but long story short
we're gonna talk about some cool stuff

14
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:28,970
so it's really easy summarized for the
most boring part of the presentation

15
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,710
I'll talk a little about who I am a
drama based out of dallas texas I'm

16
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,270
actually incident response consultant
but that doesn't mean I don't constantly

17
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,908
sit inside the third the red side of
things and like to have a lot of fun and

18
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,659
the number of times my wife has looked
at my home lab and asked me what in the

19
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,619
hell you actually doing it may not be
able to answer either has been way too

20
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,780
many times we've got a little kid home
so I'm regional hacker I like to think

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,719
she's already starting to think and
figure things out and completely blowing

22
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,229
my mind everything today which is fun
imagine are becoming standard starter as

23
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,048
well so I like to get back at night we
deny blog and I like to tell everyone if

24
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,780
anyone here has insomnia and you're
looking to get accurate just go and read

25
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,110
some of the stuff I've written

26
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,600
that are not be right out so you get to
go this is not meant to be a threat

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,519
Intel talk we're gonna talk a little
about it but this is not meant to

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,780
replace what should be a very
comprehensive and well designed threat

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,190
intelligence it's meant to track break
through an organization and then just

30
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,180
have some fun with the Mediterranean
investigators you can't just give me a

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,270
puzzle and I put all the pieces together
I'm done with that I want to know what

32
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,630
was in the picture what happened how was
put together I'm also not gonna try and

33
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,109
sell you anything free open source
please the only way to go I'm hoping

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,200
that it won't walk out of here with a
better tool kit they walked in with if

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,560
not please let me know and all that
stuff this is boring and I'll find a way

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,810
to change it I also do not know anything
about recent awesome CEO changes at a

37
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,360
company whose name rhymes with neier tie
or anything like that

38
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,820
paid attention some dude who wouldn't
want it out and some other awesome dude

39
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,560
who does it created that wasn't so let's
talk a little bit about why this matters

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,180
why should I care about this particular
campaign anyway here working for a

41
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,060
business of some sort not a concern when
you're not a consultant alright so a

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,820
couple so some of you your job is to
correct me if I'm wrong protect your

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,430
house

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,459
locker room ok you have a house to
protect why does this matter

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,230
January 2015 the FBI came out and they
started talking about these business

46
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,310
email scams and at that point in time
there's only about 2,000 victims and

47
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,400
only about two hundred and fifteen
million taken so in 14 months in the

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,209
attackers at successfully taken but not
bad not bad at all not bad for a little

49
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,250
more than a year's work dollar dollar
bill love it

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,540
bring that money in fast forward to
August 2015 the FBI updates their alert

51
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,450
hey guess what these guys have actually
stolen now closer to eight hundred

52
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,970
million on your math with end at eight
month time frame that close to six

53
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,260
hundred million dollars now I really
really like my salary oh my gosh ok so

54
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,760
these guys are pretty serious they're
able to take some money out of my wallet

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,000
let's get even more serious we had an
alert come out beginning of April of

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,650
this year we're now up to 17,000 victims
and in that time frame

57
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,680
we've got two point three billion
dollars stolen in a six-month timeframe

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,070
1.5 billion dollars stolen from these
businesses

59
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,469
power that targets with the school but
1.5 billion a little more sexy than 9

60
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,150
million so you know you can keep your
mouth phone use your days you're

61
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,609
persistent access I'm just gonna email
one PDF or walk out with a billion

62
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,210
dollars we need to care we need to be
aware of what these guys are doing

63
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,000
because guess what why does anyone here
know why rent somewhere so prolific

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
because it works

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,970
anyone saw Dave talking what I mean to
be hired to pay bitcoins porn agency

66
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,040
only proves one thing it works they're
ready to pay and the attackers are

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,730
making a ton of money I'm actually not
sure what happened with Tesla why

68
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,870
they're like you know what forget it
because everyone else what are some

69
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,560
random crap like version 9 and 10 just
rewrite the code and move on but these

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,680
guys apologized and gave up the source
and give up the master key but in any

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,000
event to make a lot of money so why stop
if you make a lot of money you're not

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,190
going to stop guess what anyone here
gotta protect our help someone else

73
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,440
protect the house this is coming it's on
your way that hasn't happened already in

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,760
fact and I really hope this doesn't
happen in this room but I've Davis

75
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,530
talkative b-sides event earlier and i
three people come up to me afterwards

76
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,469
hey that actually happened to me I
didn't know that how they don't tell me

77
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,880
publicly you just lost a couple hundred
grand reorganization reorganization lost

78
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,680
that hopefully they weren't the people
who actually got targeted and industrial

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,920
victim to it so we know why we should
care a lot of money walking out the door

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,450
I'm assuming that there's some towns and
some western parts of Africa that have

81
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,920
like ridiculous cars and houses and
everything around and we'll talk about

82
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,660
attribution just a little bit that being
said let's look at a little bit of what

83
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,290
these look like so I called whaling
because of their targets are not

84
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,400
necessarily whaling because our approach
and our goals are little bit different

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,599
but what is a little what is supposed to
a fish what is well we're targeting our

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,920
seats we are a high-level positions were
going after the big 12 pretty sure that

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,720
the casino term justice am going after
the whales inside your orientation

88
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,810
usually I want crowds I want access to
something or I want your money

89
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,549
emails and I'm to look like from someone
who you know and I might ask you to do a

90
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,480
thing right

91
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,640
hey can you cook this website my
favorite fish as well as you get these

92
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,599
days are are things like helped a girls
in the holiday photo

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,390
that is like a hundred percent success
rate Spearfish the other one is can you

94
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,340
believe these guys at this party last
week it's always like everyone wants to

95
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,070
go and tagged everyone and let them know
who they know how important there may be

96
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,310
a part of your job but it may also be a
little bit different from the norm but

97
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,280
it's moved information but it doesn't
really cause of concern for you you may

98
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
be asking yourself thanks for describing
fear spearfishing to me

99
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,409
cannot believe I am going to sit here
for an hour and watchu talkin bout

100
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,580
spearfishing not exactly the best
spearfishing the sharper spear very very

101
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,659
targeted and we deal with all of the
Nigerian Prince lottery winnings Graham

102
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,370
are really bad grammar targeted toward
the uneducated type of email that you go

103
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,100
after they're very very specific set of
ingredients inside of the skin number

104
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,170
one they're smaller businesses I'm not
gonna say a company like Google doesn't

105
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,260
get these emails but the Deathly not the
top of the target list number one number

106
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,190
two you need an incorrect domain

107
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,730
officials come from every single thing
you can think of anyone can spam from

108
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,900
anywhere but I need to have something
different and new CEO name and I need to

109
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,409
see a phony also need some random person
in some sort of accounting function who

110
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,690
doesn't want to piss off the boss so I
need to do a little bit of homework

111
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,870
ahead of time before I can construct
these and you can see the home work

112
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,870
being done as well so to get sorry let's
take a look at our second greedy and you

113
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:52,110
will know the difference between these
two but that was a space and the other

114
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,370
thoughts

115
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,930
space it's a fun change in it the one
instead of an so it looks like a space

116
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,500
number one however you can have a domain
name with the space so this is actually

117
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,290
legit email or legit domain that would
go through to the untrained eye right

118
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,540
which we are not we're trained eyes this
makes sense to us we can see the

119
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,669
difference we can see the transmission
of the change of letters and numbers you

120
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:25,820
can catch that one as soon as it popped
up with schemers is Vicky and all I need

121
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,199
to do with that info AB is a coat at the
same here know the full scope of domains

122
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,150
that one of their clients that their
company has mean have you registered in

123
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,579
BOS and businesses from aids moving or
illegitimate moving point of view are

124
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,969
you aware of what else the portfolio is
now there are so many deals that it's

125
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,410
really hard to keep up but guess what
this group of folks the ones who make

126
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,050
all the decisions on what you can do all
the money the ones who approve are

127
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,290
ridiculously tiny InfoSec budget they
are not trained they do not know what to

128
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,420
look for and your attackers are banking
on that they're banking on these people

129
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,229
looking at email and saying oh yeah yeah
whatever just go through its

130
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,490
heard some people call them the yes
crowd like everyone yelled shut up I

131
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,029
wanna run the program just go through
this is probably the same people who

132
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:11,080
back to Davis awkward just yet I don't
care let's go legitimate have work to do

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,790
number two we also need a website how
could i acquire one of these domains

134
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,540
registered

135
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,380
M one christophe dot com well in most
cases that we see with this type of

136
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,080
attack vector Vistaprint to the purveyor
and we're using the printer used it

137
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,910
before there we go

138
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,900
all right we're going we might even see
the photos from people who've been doing

139
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,520
that for you in ninety percent of cases
Vistaprint as a purveyor why number one

140
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,230
you can set up an account with a valid
credit card it's a one month free trial

141
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,730
but there is no activation know any sort
of charge not even a penny to validate

142
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,970
it whatsoever so all you need is
something that passes along check which

143
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,110
is i think what was the rain doesn't
back in there even super proud and if

144
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,370
you go right to the dot-com one of the
first banners you see is try one month

145
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,040
free if I've already done all my
homework new CEO or CFO I know which

146
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,349
took control over the accounting person
to hit him up

147
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,050
I need and we'll talk a little bit about
what the time frame I needed but I can

148
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,439
easily get it within a couple days
really like candy on Halloween is very

149
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,570
very easy for attackers to disabuse the
service which we obviously see them

150
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,550
doing I'm not going to rewrite the time
I can recreate the entire will need to

151
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,920
be who works for me is actually an
awesome post on he actually walked

152
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,709
through registering a domain and what
that looks like and how easy it is and

153
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,760
just how completely charge free and free
it actually is to do recommend checking

154
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,740
that out if if you're interested in you
know having a source to register a

155
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,770
website with no charges whatsoever that
you can drop within twenty nine days not

156
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,260
sure how they do with that but the
couple examples so Vistaprint there's

157
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,260
actually a website Vistaprint at TK that
hosts file called latest I JSON and at

158
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,000
that point in time it is the last 24
hours of every domain registered with

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,300
Vistaprint actually gotta get a box back
in the red grape I had nothing else to

160
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,349
do it so I haven't just every 24 hours
described in this town and then doing

161
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,160
some analysis on these domains I put a
couple of samples out here I don't know

162
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,750
if we're going to be easy to read on the
stream but long story short of a company

163
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,270
called Talon gurus someone right after
the website talent guru talent gurus

164
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,640
dotnet with an I between the final you
and yes and they also set up a gmail

165
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,090
account for it as well so if you've got
something like MarkMonitor some sort of

166
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,480
Domain Service thats registering domains
for you just so that attackers don't

167
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,610
squat while also registering a webmail
service with it well you don't need to

168
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,280
have that number may be it may be a
default setup done by Vistaprint but any

169
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,079
event you need that for the legitimate
service number two MarkMonitor to the

170
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,960
use Vistaprint register domains will
take a look at another one here

171
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,150
fucktard compression by the late either
of these companies in work that I

172
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,000
apologize this was not intentional
someone registered but our compression

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,560
with the final 0 actual final oh as the
numeric 0 so at some point in time again

174
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,859
set up with hope with with webmail now
again maybe someone looking to prevent

175
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,990
squatty but very very suspicious to see
this type of activity happening again

176
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,070
with the corresponding with now and I
were talking about whether he'll talk

177
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,130
about how attackers you this a thought
on this email you guys like

178
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,010
three or four sign anyone anyone notice
anything suspicious about this at all

179
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,650
I'll say that and actually no I tried to
make it look the best they could

180
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,939
number one this is not an actual forward
it looks like it

181
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,810
anyone here use Outlook 3 change into a
forward string and it starts to turn all

182
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,630
career knew this looks like an actual
for this is what people are expecting

183
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,910
see this is what your attackers are
expecting you to think gosh don't just

184
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,939
forwarded this and we hear of anyone in
the organization like the forward or

185
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,030
reply all King

186
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,170
those guys get targeted a lot your new
home seems like you know who I'm talking

187
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,300
about there's one dude just if there
wasn't a Reply All button he would not

188
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:53,719
send it you know they won't catch this
at the top Acme ABC and acne ACB it

189
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,070
slips by really quickly because you're
not looking at the from the two when you

190
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,840
first think about something suspicious
social engineering training doesn't

191
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,250
necessarily say hey make sure you check
these things out first is it from

192
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,030
legitimate person if you've got an email
are using something that accepts outward

193
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,050
and doesn't give you any sort of
internal or external notification your

194
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,620
subject lines you're not really gonna be
paying attention to that what else do we

195
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,070
have

196
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,840
4:56 p.m. on a Friday at the end of the
month

197
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,640
guess what that accounting person wants
to do right now go home and not

198
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,130
responding anymore emails they're done
they're completely tired they want to go

199
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,680
home they want to be finished with this
quarter this month and they want to move

200
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,949
on get on with their life there is a
reason that emails come in at that time

201
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:43,630
this email is made to look like it's
from gym who it's from Jim sent to Jane

202
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,680
and then Jane poured it on the John and
said hey James out can you please take

203
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,760
care of this transfer real quick because
we've got we've also got a PDF this is

204
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,819
where as a responder as an investigator
I start to get really really interested

205
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,250
in my heart finally an artifact it's not
just convoluted email letters email her

206
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,970
analysis is my gosh such a pain but it
can be super useful so we've just taken

207
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,240
what was a really really simple email
and I forgot to highlight too there's

208
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,339
one that always sticks out I see if
anyone catches it

209
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:13,379
there's always the grammatical errors as
well as the double space between the

210
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,709
haves and the a good weekend but it's
really really easy anyone can think of

211
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:19,128
how an attacker would get around that

212
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:23,670
of how that would not seem suspicious
anymore all I have to throw at the

213
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,809
bottom out email is sent from my iPhone
and all of its okay shes right now on

214
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:31,670
your iPhone you probably made around
that's what average people think would

215
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,610
happen I double tap space I'm busy I
have time to go back I'm already home

216
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,269
gonna boss you're still at the office
could you not so do this thing from you

217
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:43,430
real quick so let's take a look at our
PDF it what's inside

218
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:48,110
really really interesting stuff we get a
bank name we get a company name we get

219
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,779
back an account number and routing
number and we all forget who we should

220
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:55,279
be credited this too is this normally
how a business receives wiring

221
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,829
instructions they would receive
instructions its way I didn't think so

222
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,399
this is not normally how this type of
stuff is sent through so what's our

223
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,069
first kind of preventive step with their
first measure hey accounting department

224
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:09,990
I know you guys are InfoSec I know
you're not super super I T Town 21 not

225
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,319
but if you see wiring instructions that
come in the form of a PDF that looks

226
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:18,729
like it was written in WordPad WordPad
then converted to PDF real quick

227
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,620
you might want to just throw up a flag
real quick but what if people do instead

228
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,389
I want to piss off the bus and I want to
piss off the CEO I don't pass up the CFO

229
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:31,300
so I'm just gonna send this thing and
they're banking on that they're banging

230
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,550
that has to happen but let's move a
little bit past the deficiencies again

231
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,359
it's easy to complain much better to
start to turn around and fix it

232
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,959
let's take a look at these indicators
this is where as an investigator got to

233
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,839
have a lot of fun and start to build up
the metadata this attack group number

234
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,129
one let's talk about our situation we've
got a company just lost a hundred and

235
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,709
fifty grant counties in trouble bills
are being paid productivity lost how do

236
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,809
we take this bad situation and as
investigators are as a team we have a

237
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:55,800
little bit of fun with it

238
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,420
well we know that's right we easily know
that we can figure it out we deal in

239
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,699
puddles on a daily basis there's a way
that we can fix this so let's start with

240
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,959
artifacts we have a domain and you will
hear the domains gonna be any use to be

241
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,329
anonymously register to vote supreme
with a stolen credit card there's not

242
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:16,170
really much of anything out of that we
have a PDF

243
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,439
any use from the media and even think of
any properties of a PDF that maybe would

244
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,519
be really useful I'm gonna start with an
offer right anyone here have a window

245
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,500
when you use Windows ok are getting some
hands of someone that way that's good

246
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,310
when you register windows was one of the
first things that ask you for your name

247
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,089
when you install any application going
forward that has any sort of signature

248
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,519
tagging guess what name polls and had
been to that the name that you gave at

249
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,630
the very beginning let you go in and
change it or remove it so guess what the

250
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,490
name that you gave the beginning is the
name that is gonna pull we've got a

251
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,430
table we've got an indie 585 gonna be
any use not really a single PDF that was

252
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,310
sent to one company we've got machine
information we've got time stamps now

253
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,739
we've also got banking information so
we've got a lot of artifacts from the

254
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,089
tiny little somewhat useless PDF that we
can actually start to extrapolate on

255
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,889
other thoughts for the business do we
normally work with this bank

256
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,360
normally work with Bank of America and
Durham North Carolina at four oh four

257
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,549
bucks and drive which I hope is a really
really good address to be a great back

258
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,579
not been kind of thing does information
match expected financial dijo do we

259
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,889
expect to see this type of information
it does the vendor look familiar to you

260
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:33,130
even do business with R&R engraving
that's for the business you know there's

261
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,090
a lot of business considerations you
think about us for info so let's just

262
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,530
have some fun with this so let's lay the
foundation what information security

263
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,799
training teach people about PDF files
PDF too bad the really really bad be

264
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,179
very careful don't run anything so what
do people do with PDS then they upload

265
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,049
them to Mourdock omnipotent virustotal
and everyone says oh ok this PDF say

266
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,179
therefore I can open it I don't
understand how we got past the content

267
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,380
park and just that there's no Malvern
cited to see media on it is texting

268
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,380
easier for us think that lets users to
our advantage

269
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,970
let's take these open open source sites
you obviously can't get the source code

270
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,970
for my recital but you can use it freely
if you like let us know where their

271
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,560
metadata summer talking about this field
that you have embedded inside Wikipedia

272
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,270
I'm gonna start with the author so in
this case we got an author whose name or

273
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:26,590
who goes by the name boss law I don't
know what that is supposed to mean I'm

274
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,030
assuming he thinks highly of himself and
he's probably quite vain but we've also

275
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,850
got time same format as well this the
time things are going to mean much at

276
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,020
the moment only because they're so far
back but they do correspond to very

277
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,680
closely when we saw the breach happened
so I'm gonna take that into a right I

278
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,790
got one pedia what else has boss lot
done because this is a field that it

279
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,990
dumped in streams and is tracked by some
of these open source site seventeen

280
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,880
different results for Boston so now I'm
starting to build out boss launch PDF

281
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,650
portfolio of what he was creating what
he was designing as he was writing all

282
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:02,750
of his fishes overtime I can start to
number one there to track all the little

283
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,970
details we talked about earlier what
companies using what banks gon from

284
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,680
here's some examples we've got companies
like our engraving oriental wiring Cpl

285
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:19,980
wiry Rick Rickert wiring Sparta wiring
wiring as as a turn so knowing that

286
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,330
knowing what we know can we assume that
bar code works alone can we assume that

287
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,360
two point three billion dollars is
stolen by one guy with a Mac in a PDF

288
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,639
career most likely not think of any
other terms we could look for I can give

289
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:40,920
you a little here somewhat set out what
that about what exactly

290
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,550
wiring instructions so let's start to
look for wiring instructions what else

291
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,970
can we find on these sites that has the
name wire instructions so what I'm doing

292
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,210
now is identifying how this attack group
works and I'm starting to build a

293
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,880
profile of not only the author also how
they maintain their documents as well

294
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,820
let's take a look at now our focus on
our life just goes viral total sometimes

295
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:05,439
get a little funny Mauer has 55 results
of PDF files war with wiring

296
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,100
instructions inside the note these types
of searches can very very quickly spin

297
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,260
off the rails and extrapolate out of
control remember to keep your focus on

298
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,120
the documents that you're looking at
your focus on PBS your focus on what

299
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,310
looked like wiring instructions
Republican kind of weird random things

300
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,080
like we've got things in here

301
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,429
Autolite limited again oriental wiring
shows up now we've got Hong Kong well

302
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,450
incorporated so what did we find what
did we find as we went through this

303
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,559
research and as we started to map this
out I did this in about half

304
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,360
an hour here's the zoomed out view red
is authors yellow is documents

305
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,299
green is banks that they're using anyone
seen each Oak Point banks obviously are

306
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,230
the easiest ones but look at the number
of documents these officers put together

307
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,710
this is insane for now are we doing
we're building out what this group I

308
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,759
don't take gang but there's been some
news article that referred him as a gang

309
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,440
that that we start to build out what
this game looks like what they're the

310
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,669
things that they're going out we also
get additional authors from all this

311
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:04,299
information is well past the stage of
boss lot now

312
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:09,570
now look at these names compact houdini
raid kills with the disease and also

313
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,928
called the same you always amused great
because he put his entire full name and

314
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:14,190
all these documents

315
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,340
actually likes to target individuals as
well we see them into the pediatricians

316
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,709
so without again letting this been up to
par control each one of these now

317
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,190
becomes a search term for all my
different sites I use virustotal on mars

318
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,470
examples because they're a accessible
and easy to use but if anyone's got

319
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,080
proprietary sources are you got a good
API your searches can be even more

320
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,369
extensive and even deeper and hopefully
find more artifacts would also be fine

321
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:42,029
we found the bank that they like to use
as well

322
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:46,909
HSBC Bank of America these aren't
necessarily foreign banks to anyone hSBC

323
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:51,059
is a massive multi-billion dollar
company corporation however does my

324
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,480
company normally do business with HSBC
so I'm in a blue team and I'm trying to

325
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,789
find a way to check my organization from
this type of attack I wanna know things

326
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:02,730
like this because I want to tell the
accounting team what types of banks

327
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,809
doing normally work with who we work
with these banks if we do that we need

328
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:09,309
to wrap controls around we understand
what our attackers like where they like

329
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:12,259
to park their money let's make sure
we're not parking money there as well

330
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:16,249
and we are what make sure we understand
what we're doing with money that's part

331
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:21,070
there we only have two accounting SVC
for example outside of those two are not

332
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,418
interested in transfers some banks are
only used once and I apologize maybe a

333
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:29,039
little harder don't mean that we've got
some banks and only used one that makes

334
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,650
a some of the questions as well why are
they leaving him one

335
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,090
hSBC is used multiple times wire some
like China Citizens Bank only use one of

336
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,889
the attackers testing now the damn
you'll fail them you'll get arrested on

337
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,690
their way there but again it's a key
data points we want to know about

338
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,790
because it stand out at an omelet or
normal accounting behavior again it was

339
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,420
about 2013 out a twenty thirty minutes
of research that the last 10 with mostly

340
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,660
internal this kind of stuff we got
hundreds of results we built a massive

341
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,980
dashboard tons of PDF we're able to take
the campaign a little bit larger

342
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,900
actually a couple hours

343
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,970
fully diluted out and doing every single
circuit thing go and just got larger and

344
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,940
larger and larger to the point where I
need to stop cuz im just gonna spend

345
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,270
forever on this 2.2 million dollars the
lot of documents I come through those a

346
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,850
lot of fun doing up this profile but I
think what I really wanted to make sure

347
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,840
we focus on is the tools the track
profile visualized as a blue team as

348
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,139
we're starting to defend these networks
I need something inside of my network

349
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,350
that helped me protect and resurgent
access my information a lot better so

350
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,629
I'm just gonna start by saying this if
you're working in InfoSec and you're not

351
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,950
keeping notes on previous engagements
adversaries malware suspicious activity

352
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,000
whatever it is I hate the sprays you
doing it wrong I hate it but it works

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,710
you need to be given ot need to be
finding ways to keep data from point to

354
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,170
point the point is cumulative it is
that's why we have version it's not

355
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,210
everything virgin one night only just
been really something new we get better

356
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,860
as time goes on we can't be resetting
the clock as defenders red team and

357
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,199
especially consultants have a little
easier every single companies different

358
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,470
let me start over and find something new
you have to continually be going to

359
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,760
learn the vulnerable vulnerable to
report to my job and the number of

360
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,750
vulnerability reports are at like two
three four years old and every year the

361
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,810
same vulnerability over and over again
you have to keep militantly be getting

362
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,850
better that being said if you are
looking at doing threat intelligence

363
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:25,260
this is all you need just get yourself a
pew pew map 70 inch monitor inside of

364
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,920
your lab and you're good to go

365
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,580
that's it

366
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,220
honestly just getting this is probably
the worst I've ever done so that there's

367
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,290
if you are running a small company in
new orleans' China attack in england has

368
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,860
nothing to do with you whatsoever in
fact it's probably not even an attack

369
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,770
it's just ip-based correlation that some
companies spent all of their money on

370
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,500
their way here from north to get all of
their money on visualization and actual

371
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,880
products but how can we start but
certainly basic one of the best

372
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,020
note-taking tool is no pet there's
nothing wrong with handing over to the

373
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,360
person coming out for you or the guy
taking the shift over a text file with

374
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,949
your notes from that show is funny I a
lot of movies that you watch anyone here

375
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,940
watching like pirate movies are old
style like you know explore moving line

376
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,060
that they always have these things
called captains logs and it's always

377
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,530
like the most it's always the narration
of the story like captains log today

378
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,420
John Smith almost fell overboard and use
Jason Segel or something like that it's

379
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,250
like it's so trivial but if I was taking
over from the captain I wanna know why

380
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,220
john's leg is broken you know that
little tiny detail how me know that so

381
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,780
keep notes you can upgrade your game a
little bit if you want good notepad plus

382
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,310
plus you could even go back to old
school and just do diary journal and

383
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,210
penned the paper as long as you're
keeping notes that you're not keeping

384
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,830
notes right now start with something the
simplest form is better than nothing

385
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,970
always include enough information that
if you read it again you would remember

386
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,080
the event voice so that actually kind of
plays into report writing as well

387
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,389
every single artifact should stand on
its own every statement should be a full

388
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,110
sentence you should be able to reread a
page a year later I remember what

389
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,240
happened in that incident I remember it
because this just refresh me not because

390
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,440
I had to recall much stuff I'll remember
this work 0 percent of the time they

391
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,170
were here said I'll remember this a
hundred percent of the time they

392
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,490
remember to do that exactly I did not
think so no one ever if you do that you

393
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,770
deserve some sort of in a global world

394
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,030
also ahead again I hate this analogy hit
by a bus but it's a very good strategy

395
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:28,210
that works if you are the sole keeper of
some sort of key in your environment

396
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,770
some sort of threat in telling your
environment and you were to not show up

397
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,790
tomorrow and the company got attacked
tomorrow and it happened to be the

398
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,510
apocalypse of sick days

399
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,430
and incident response would your company
drought if they do you're doing your job

400
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,300
wrong you should be able to and again
you may be the most elite personal TV

401
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,620
but you still need to equip others
around you to be able to act without you

402
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,419
there you can really step your game up a
little bit and go to bed sheets

403
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,770
spreadsheets are really really good to
an Intel because they give obvious

404
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,970
correlation you can look at a
spreadsheet and immediately say ok this

405
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,130
role in this column matchup we're all
trained to think through various message

406
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,160
of school and websites to look at a
table and understand exactly what's

407
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,890
happening

408
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,780
allows you to mean relational data and
make it I can also find patterns and

409
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,280
inconsistencies much better there is no
AI machine in the world ever ever read

410
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,560
about ever seen ever demoed that can
beat me at identifying patterns anyone

411
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,270
here ever done any sort of malware
string analysis we're done any time our

412
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,660
analysis how much power analysis is
running something and then just

413
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,830
scrolling cause you're looking for
patterns there's no way I machine I can

414
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,520
say oh hey by the way I don't know if
you noticed but this alphabet decreases

415
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,330
in increases in letter that you go down
I can only see that just by looking

416
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,210
through your naked eye can see a lot
better you gonna pick up patterns a lot

417
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,480
faster so find a way to maintain it in a
way that lets you find these patterns

418
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,500
there's an example of expression to get
him a little bit hard to read what one

419
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,790
of the first things you notice when you
look at that table right there there's

420
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,020
two empty cells if this is the indicator
source tracking for my entire

421
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,780
organization why are there two cells
missing did someone forget to record

422
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,560
them do we not have them do not get that
file was that not available that day

423
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,700
what is going on

424
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,950
immediately you're looking for things
that need to be improved we can also

425
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,890
take a look inside to see similarities
between these hashes lineup I can do

426
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,170
sort they can do different types of
elation don't matter what makes

427
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,540
spreadsheet even more baller is
visualization

428
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,879
use multi go before awesome tool the
case file actually just became

429
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,710
completely available to do community and
more recently so I highly recommend

430
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,950
using this nation however manual TiVo
and I hate sin then right-click typing

431
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,990
right click typing record however CSV
tumulty go really really easy member

432
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,440
this guy this little table that you're
tracking so that kinda multicore real

433
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,010
quick and it's gonna pop out with a

434
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,480
with the graph some sort of
visualization this right here in 10

435
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,400
percent tutsi sweet tea sweets wanna see
that grabbed at the bottom and you can

436
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,670
see them pretty things like already is
the number of attackers yellow is a

437
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,620
number of documents and green in the
number of bank that's totally get it

438
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,310
there's a lot of shit going on I should
pay attention to this down the wake up

439
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,190
and all of a sudden those people who
make the decisions on all the money but

440
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,060
visualization not only helps us
portrayed better and let us speak to

441
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,280
other departments as well let's find
this checkpoint let us talk to our data

442
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,560
scientist who may be our organization
hey help me find where we can tweak our

443
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,230
processes and find things to look for

444
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,020
there's also really great threat
tracking platforms out there as well I

445
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,870
actually there's quite a few screenshots
and hear of a tool called threat note

446
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,179
was written by Brian where I might be
mispronouncing Brian's last name I I

447
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,390
usually say it different ways everything
what time it allows you to track

448
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,990
indicators of many different types and
he finds IP addresses threat accurate

449
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,340
it's an awesome tool completely free and
open source to get better every single

450
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:46,929
day he integrates it with tons and tons
of tools out there I highly recommend if

451
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,340
you're looking for a way to track but
can you find what you're looking for

452
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,659
something that helps you just keep track
of everything that comes through I would

453
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,060
recommend checking this out I also make
sure if you're keeping track of these

454
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,879
threats and your profile and things that
are coming to your advantage as well

455
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,150
make sure you're not keeping track of
the noise and labeling into the true

456
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,470
positive and to be there and do the foot
high that make sure you're not throwing

457
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,380
true positives in with blankets as well
some threat Intel reports come out and

458
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,600
get a hundred and eighty-five cinema if
you've got one and b5 hitting your

459
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,159
environment that does not mean you have
that apec may mean that they use the

460
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,920
variation of some sort of standing tall
that happens to be in there as well so

461
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,080
from a list of a hundred I've got one
indy five that an actual indicator for

462
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,070
me 99 that are you don't pollute your
own potential source that unfortunately

463
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,240
mr. Yin wrong direction

464
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,090
API is your friend as well maybe I can
be used to enrich our data provide more

465
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:41,020
context now no money coming from any guy
china is not for at Intel

466
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,599
North an indication of an IP address
coming from China that does not mean you

467
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,439
are being attacked by the Chinese it
simply means that a computer connected

468
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,450
to another computer and one of the ideas
of that computer was in china doll means

469
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,339
don't get hung up on paid for his unpaid
either all the research that we didn't

470
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:00,940
hear I built a 2.3 billion dollar gang
campaign and I did it all with open

471
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,149
source tools on the Internet a matter of
hours there is no paid tool that would

472
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:06,619
have helped with that whatsoever

473
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:08,789
maybe it would have been my searches
bathroom maybe I could have done a

474
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:12,389
command-line search as opposed to using
the web browser but doesn't necessarily

475
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:14,079
mean I was unable to do my job

476
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,440
don't get hung up on the paid receipt
young paid but do get hung up on the

477
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,950
value that provide power now malware is
not a threat intelligence source

478
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,679
whatsoever they do not claim to be it is
online Google Sandbox but all in it but

479
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,469
when I get out of our again I built a
campaign ago that a profile so find ways

480
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:34,429
to use these tools that are readily
available to you and find ways to take

481
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,859
data out of him that can actually help
you as opposed to not useless it doesn't

482
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:42,119
mean anything from you whatsoever that
being said I have to give an important

483
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,738
disclaimer if you do find brand new
malware

484
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:49,940
uploaded please all I had to work a
breach of that a bank a couple years ago

485
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,869
and not only was the bank extremely
targeted and under an active attack but

486
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:58,649
they also do not want to work with us as
consultant whatsoever

487
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,820
the only way we found out the attack was
still going on with my refreshing

488
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,749
virustotal string search is because they
would get now and upload the virus holes

489
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:07,149
every 15 minutes

490
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:11,248
attackers would deploy new malware
create a new empty five the security

491
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:12,309
team would find it there

492
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,049
upload the virus will and they were
going to block the 95 they did this for

493
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,489
about three hours before fine I came
back I said hey guys look we've been

494
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:21,749
watching you for three hours do all this
just by watching virus so you're

495
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:25,659
obviously not going to win if you're
just going to keep on blogging is just

496
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:28,950
what the attackers were going at five in
the exact same page we're looking at it

497
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,379
well just wait and see that being said
how do we start to get better we know

498
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:37,079
there's a massive campaign out there we
were able to build out indicators are

499
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:40,089
able to build a profile with his
attacker to look like we're able to fill

500
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:42,019
out a profile of how they work

501
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:46,700
what may be coming into my organization
so number one will expensive ass malware

502
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,530
detonation device help be

503
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:53,700
no not at all 0 day prevention banner
you thought our essay will be useless in

504
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,530
this case because it is just a PDF of
texts there's nothing in there that's

505
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:02,620
gonna trigger anything whatsoever unless
you're doing some sort of crazy OCR and

506
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,370
you're looking for banking on
information inside PCs in which case

507
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,510
more power to you will expensive a
threat intelligence help is any threat

508
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:14,180
intelligence service here going to tell
you by the way we spoke to some dude the

509
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:19,550
Nigeria you are going to get fish next
month so keep an eye out for no no one

510
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:24,030
is going to be able to do that how do
you know when you get hit you don't so

511
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,220
we have a little bit better

512
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,900
will a malware only focus help I think
they've made a really good point earlier

513
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,300
and I i wish i could have said it first
but virtually usually says it better

514
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:39,480
0 days are super super sexy any red team
was in the room 10 days have you used to

515
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:47,330
bring new number not not commercially so
far paid for paid engagements you don't

516
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,740
need your own is again why are we
focusing all of our activity on all my

517
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,540
gosh you guys see that talking black hat
we need to make sure we're defending

518
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:00,430
against the super super elite exploit
that was developed in a lab by a bunch

519
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,440
of students who have no jobs and lots of
time and we're not defending against

520
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,830
this our organizations gonna be at risk
no problem

521
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,679
anyone here give any information
security training to the accounting

522
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,990
department gained 2.3 billion dollars
means don't look in your environment and

523
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:20,290
think about where your weakest links
actually are again I hate coming back to

524
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,980
the old adage of people people people
people people are people on trains

525
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,940
therefore they're getting it but now it
there's a lot of exploitable code up

526
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,659
there you're right there's a lot of
weaknesses found and yes there was

527
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,590
recently a security company who was
found to be running the patties route

528
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,510
and allowed for a couple exploit it turn
into a massive discussing legal

529
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,419
situation can't comment on that but in
any event yes there's a lot of crap out

530
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:45,810
there that happens in that puts people
in bed or bad situation however start

531
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,779
with start internally started beating
again if your job is to protect your

532
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,960
house then look at your house and say
where am I actually vulnerable here are

533
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,550
you going to pack everything web server
in the world are you going to get

534
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,820
complete security control over the
development

535
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,560
no they don't care they want everything
open they want everything to be by the

536
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,040
fall they can write scripts and they
want API's to be a simple what else

537
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,500
should we be doing to get better we
should be sharing this information

538
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,260
sharing it actually caring like this is
a very sentimental slide probably

539
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,720
because the puppy dogs carrying his dick
on there together something as prolific

540
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,899
at eight hundred million began now we're
up to 2.3 billion should not be news it

541
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,790
should not be the first time you hear
about a multi-billion dollar global

542
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,630
email scam the first time you get hit
should not be the first time you hear

543
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,180
about it we need to be paying attention
to what goes on out there again is a

544
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,799
smaller organization going to see the
same threats as citibank or as Google or

545
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,710
as a porous Facebook no they're not so
don't act like you're going to as well

546
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,970
and that's not to be demeaned anyone its
focus on what you're actually gonna be

547
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,529
targeted with what actually become a few
what that's going to be coming for you

548
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:59,340
krebs should not be your ideas it's like
this joke that started I don't know if

549
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,320
it was swift unsecured I don't know how
I got started with someone came up with

550
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,830
the phrase of Brian Krebs my IDs and got
turned to like t-shirts and bumper guys

551
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,910
an international press release about
your fault should not be your idea I

552
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,620
know it's meant in jest but at the same
time it should really be your goal is to

553
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,250
avoid that and it's funny to now I have
worked on a lot of financially motivated

554
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,060
cases people a call when you get all
this done before credit reports us like

555
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,410
that that's your motivation for finding
an attacker in stopping fraud in your

556
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,750
environment so that Brian Krebs as a
tweak your name out there we need to be

557
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,680
a little more concerned with what's
actually going on here not only is

558
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,290
sharing caring and avoiding krebs my
ideas we should also not be embarrassed

559
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,860
to admit what happened as well

560
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,190
blanket statement here I'm not asking
any company to give out any proprietary

561
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,680
information but it is ok to say you can
spare fished it is ok to say where you

562
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,750
were touched on the doll it's alright we
are all being targeted every single one

563
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,850
of us in some way shape or form whether
its 10,000 Nigerian print email that day

564
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,810
or whether it's someone coming after my
c-suite because they want to steal X

565
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,340
amount of dollars from my environment
we're all being targeted

566
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,940
it's ok to admit increases and decreases
a new campaign it's ok to share those

567
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,900
with others as they went here doing any
sort of industry base or collective

568
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,260
burden-sharing I don't mean you signed
up for threat connect anything if they

569
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,480
were here doing any sort of cross
company industry sharing see there's

570
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,190
ways for us to set up and share
indicators between organizations and say

571
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,830
hey other people who are in the small to
medium-sized you know oil and gas

572
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:37,600
business in the New Orleans area we just
got fishing we just lost $250,000 here's

573
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,089
what we learned here's what you guys
should be ok now for its ok to share the

574
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,830
details it's not embarrass easy it's
embarrassing when you get hit again and

575
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,020
again and again and again it's
embarrassing when krebs tweet about you

576
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,440
it's embarrassing when the FBI uses your
name as the case study for this story

577
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,980
it's not embarrassing to call up someone
that you play golf with every weekend

578
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,920
and just say hey by the way we got
attacked you should know about this it's

579
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,880
ok to share indicators here's the PDS
here's the names whose the bank accounts

580
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,080
get your county department we can all
start to collectively raise it up a

581
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,600
little bit not only are we sharing now
we've got a way to track and share as

582
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,020
well we have tools we have platforms
there was definitely a period of time

583
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,280
when it was very very difficult to
maintain a comprehensible set of

584
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,450
indicators is very difficult to maintain
actionable intelligence in my

585
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,620
environment those tool now exists in
their free and open source and they're

586
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,230
darn easy to install you when you're not
running Python set up I all right you

587
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,580
can almost all connected on out there
and you can always call threat

588
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,770
intelligence platforms very open source
very simple and last but not least I

589
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,870
think one of the most important
considerations your organization is not

590
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,910
expecting you they're not asking you to
become a threat intelligence experts

591
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:49,140
here signed a contract that says line
one you will be a threat intelligence

592
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,940
expert go back and renegotiated you're
gonna have a really really tough time

593
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,900
with that no one asked you to do that
but you are being asked to protect an

594
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,970
organization so again focus on what
you're actually being asked to do focus

595
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,339
your your research on that focus your
indicators on that because you're

596
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,110
tracking on that and you gonna find
yourself a lot more successful again I

597
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,560
hope no one in this room has been hit by
the scam but if you have think of ways

598
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,310
your organization grow and learn from
that and kind of a little encore part

599
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,360
sometimes it does get better that's
really really frustrating to put

600
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,870
together an entire case anyone here ever
lost the case to the FBI ok all your

601
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,330
very very lucky then I did investigation
a few years ago it actually turned out

602
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,580
to be apt 19 out work for many who
released all that but we are about three

603
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,470
months into a massive investigation of a
huge engineering company and we got all

604
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,399
the way through got the report written
got this beautiful analysis done we had

605
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,300
to know the whiteboard thing it looks
like CSI cyber inside there that's a

606
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,340
legit we work and it's just crap
everywhere pins are bred string all

607
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:52,000
kinds of with the whole thing mapped out
from soup to nuts and i cant in one

608
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,440
Monday morning and it was all gone all
taken away and I was like went to my my

609
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,680
possible time and I said hey it's like
six months of research and analysis and

610
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,660
an active investigation and active
attacker what the hell happened there I

611
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,359
call ya the FBI came in and took over
the case so we're officially done go

612
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,580
find another engagement to work just
like Monday morning done thanks a lot I

613
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,140
was really really upset at the time but
you know you get over things and then

614
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,200
something cool like this happens a
non-member the name called the same you

615
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,629
that we found inside of our pts guess
what January 2016 cold it's got arrested

616
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,510
so all of this and other we used
actually turned into something I i

617
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,660
worked probably about 10 to 15 of the
cases that they are crossed multiple

618
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,940
different states but I was able to help
put together the case that the FBI

619
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,150
eventually actually some of our report
text became what they put final press

620
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,480
release which is kind of fun but it does
get better I know sometimes it seems

621
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,810
very very futile to go through all this
you lose tons of money you spend hours

622
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,360
you lose a lot of sleep family misses
you all kind of stuff and you like this

623
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,670
was just a little fraud case but
sometimes it does get better sometimes

624
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,100
we don't just have an indictment of a
Chinese people and then it just gets

625
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,310
left that which is a funny joke into
itself but in any event he's now in

626
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,650
custody in Dallas I can only go visit
him to these days where I live in this

627
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,420
research and I'd love to know kind of
before happen you know how do you guys

628
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:16,080
talk about this but I doubt he'd
probably give me an information but it

629
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,100
was nice to see a lot of this research
actually come to fruition and then

630
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,910
someone is arrested this guy who's
stolen somewhere in the vicinity I think

631
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,569
he was about twenty thirty

632
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,600
himself he's looking at like 30 years in
jail and fines mark and stuff so again

633
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,930
there's sometimes a light at the end of
the top and then there are the particle

634
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,589
the end of the rainbow with that
everybody in this thank you very much to

635
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:41,540
number one everyone attending really
really hard to complain about being a

636
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,140
conference in New Orleans it's a
beautiful here and thanks to everyone

637
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,390
who helped out with the tools as well as
I mentioned that I love with any

638
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,859
questions if there are any and thank you
