1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:49,300
so feel free come up and grab a shot I'm
not kidding no security or something

2
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:59,620
already so feel free to come up and get
a result so anyway welcome to high low

3
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,140
and medium bone scan on your site

4
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:15,509
drink drink drink salute will warn you
this talk is a little bit basic but I

5
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,560
think it's pretty good so basically this
is just a flesh wounds and you'll see

6
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,810
the screen already so little bit about
me my name is brick rubble you can find

7
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,450
me on Twitter at static attacks you can
also send hate mail and death threats or

8
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,950
you know telling me how awesome I am
effects that affect our calm and

9
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,930
application security enthusiasts a
member of the perimeter scanning

10
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,950
services team at rapid seven broker of
web apps and of course owner of a

11
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:59,350
majestic beard so we just a placeholder
tomatoes until the end of the talk you

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,449
do you have any questions or
clarifications or maybe the ad

13
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:12,370
feel free just don't be this guy
basically what are we covering covering

14
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,660
a little bit of background about me
where to talk about the differences

15
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:23,670
between network security and application
security overview in my opinion and

16
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,290
security is security overview why is it
so hard

17
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,630
a few examples of low medium and
informational findings basically we can

18
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,430
stay over at the end and I kinda like we
have time maybe have a little bit of

19
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,030
discussion so here we go

20
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,578
ok so basically I came up with the stock
so I was working with our perimeter

21
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:53,569
scanning services team and I see a lot
of different vulnerability findings

22
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:59,130
however many tended to be informational
low or medium vulnerabilities in the

23
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,849
most common customer responses we get
tend to be you know this is a low

24
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,920
severity finding it is more than likely
doesn't affect me my network my web

25
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,069
application my customers my data nobody
will ever look to see how this affects

26
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,470
them being part of the perimeter
scanning services team to give you some

27
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,459
overview is mainly you know PCI scanning
which we all hate you know nobody likes

28
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,690
PCI but the good part is you get a
really awesome sampling of what people

29
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,290
have out there so this is just basically
based on a lot of what I see out there

30
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:43,899
so we have any application security
people out there no no center Josh

31
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,260
that's good then so

32
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,140
so basically I found this was kind of
hilarious I found this on server fall

33
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,359
example of application security versus
network security

34
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,950
basically the guy was talking about a
simple way to think of it is devices you

35
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,940
have in your kitchen like a microwave
and toaster blender in the network level

36
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:15,010
is the connection maybe ed electricity
in your example or the application level

37
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:22,650
is a specific to the thing you know like
the buttons or or something like that so

38
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,960
in our example the network level attack
would be like cutting the power or

39
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,909
sending the wrong voltage and
application-level attack would be like

40
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,780
putting something like putting tin foil
in the microwave I thought that was

41
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:42,880
pretty funny so let's put something in
the microwave so historically with

42
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,510
network security what we're looking at
is focused on the network firewalls and

43
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,180
the perimeter vulnerabilities that we
find in network security tend to be

44
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,500
known as sea bees and I say fairly
reliable rating system you know that we

45
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,870
get from you then mister mitre it's
usually shaped around application-level

46
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:14,380
things like for like we see with red hat
or Microsoft or something like that

47
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,770
vulnerability management programs today
are basically shaped around network

48
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:25,650
security so basically I promised this I
would use the stock photo my slut so I

49
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:34,310
just kind of threw the summer so
basically the best example that I like

50
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:43,680
to use for 250 which most of you all
probably know as MSO a dash 067

51
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,669
basically it has a CVSS score of a 10
it's definitely not workers

52
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:55,200
exploitable and pretty much we all know
that we can fire up

53
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:06,590
get mad at her and we can get a remote
shell with it is basically what an

54
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,119
organization does it protects critical
data from external threats by ensuring

55
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
the security of all the software used to
run the business whether it's built

56
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,440
internally but from a third party or
downloaded application security helps

57
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,660
identify fix and prevent security
vulnerabilities in any kind of software

58
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:32,260
application brings us to why is out sick
so hard the main issue is that no two

59
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,810
web applications are the same even if
you look at on coming from like Facebook

60
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,870
or or anybody else that the larger sites
you know you have several different

61
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,950
people using I'm using lots of different
libraries and you almost never see 22

62
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,770
the same applications basically most
asked tools and static analysis tools

63
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:02,299
are using CWE he's which tend to be a
bit with certain seeds so basically

64
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,680
we're going to the mitre site and we're
seeing you know kind of some

65
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,770
recommendations it's very loosely worded
you know and it's very generic titling

66
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:20,109
unlike seabees or so basically web
vulnerability is an unintended flaw or

67
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,590
weakness in the application that leads
to process critical data and insecure

68
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,229
way so basically essentially when you're
looking at web applications were finding

69
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:37,120
0 days within the code her application
fun fact about 70% of all applications

70
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,660
had at least one vulnerability
classified as one of the top 10 web

71
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,660
vulnerabilities from Louis

72
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:56,650
so we have to stop and look at these
things being honest I think the first

73
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,739
thing is just the lack of training to
know when to identify anything with

74
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,660
application security there's no time a
lot of people are running really lean

75
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,960
these days so you've got like two guys
and if you guys are anything like me

76
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,080
somebody hands you a book and says
hearing aid this up and running or

77
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,969
congratulations you're now the web
security guy so I think we can all kind

78
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,400
of sympathize with that sometimes people
just don't care you know why should I do

79
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,549
weather application security on security
guy I do I R I do you know network

80
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,338
security I don't really care about that
and I think the saudis one that I

81
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,730
usually see as I just want to check the
checkbox whether it's for you know PCI

82
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,370
Sox are hit by and I think that's the
biggest one that I've always run into is

83
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:57,240
having customers to say oh well you know
I don't need to fix that the risk you

84
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:07,130
know like are you kidding so you know
where we're even talking about this so

85
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,040
basically the whole thing is I just kind
of wanted to give you a little

86
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,010
background on how I feel about
application security and kinda let you

87
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,310
know what we're leading up to you which
is a few examples that I have so

88
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:27,739
basically the first example is user
credentials sent in clear text you see

89
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:36,740
this basically pretty easy to set up a
Wireshark go ahead and and capture

90
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,790
credentials or to see if they're being
sent securely are not so as you can see

91
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:48,130
we're seeing you know the the user
credentials right there so basically why

92
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,450
is this bad it's I now know your
username and/or password so even if you

93
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,910
pull up a one site

94
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,600
the reuse rate is between 12 and 20
percent for most username and password

95
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,810
combos so you know you're basically
harvesting credentials and you can go

96
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,229
ahead and slamming into other sites

97
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,260
this one's kinda thought I don't know
why it's considered a low but the

98
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,939
session token in the URL as you can see
all these examples have the session

99
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,300
token in the URL so the question is why
is that bad

100
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,569
so basically you guys all know what a
session token does anybody that doesn't

101
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:38,690
cause I don't believe you basically
session token or a session cookie is

102
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,190
what keeps track of your login
information so basically you're looking

103
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,010
at your username or password information
about you being logged in so why is this

104
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,920
bad

105
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:57,540
basically all we need to do is copy this
URL from whatever system Iran I can go

106
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,099
to any browser depending on the session
token doing a good job then you will

107
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,080
have a very low session token timeout if
not then we can go ahead and just copy

108
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,650
this URL and paste it into another
browser so basically I just grabbed your

109
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:19,780
bank account I just grabbed your Amazon
account I just grabs your Twitter

110
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:27,339
anything like that as long as I can do
it in a fast enough time this is my

111
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,770
personal favorite HDV HTTP debug turned
on in production

112
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:40,100
basically as you can see here had to
redact a lot of the stuff but you know

113
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,140
it's giving me the server name given to
the server address giving away

114
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:52,010
DBA information so why is this bad
basically ECB debug is designed to go

115
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:58,810
ahead and and before testing in a you
know QA environment should never be

116
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:06,839
turned on in production so basically
sand the HEB debug command to it and it

117
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,889
will return some very interesting
information whether it's about the API

118
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:17,070
whether it's about the database
connection or you know that type of

119
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,130
information on this is basically helped
a Charles Bridge I don't know if you

120
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:27,870
guys have turned on somebody was able to
get in a while just sequence action and

121
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:35,850
grab all the data so this one is
information leakage and as you can see

122
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:42,459
from this this one is pretty detailed so
it's showing me the software version

123
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:51,260
basically showing me the site the
program telling me the username and the

124
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,769
role that they have given me a pretty
good error message was well in a lot of

125
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,990
times people will put things in there
like what version of iOS their own

126
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,930
version of asp.net their own version of
Apache there are so you kind of think to

127
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,410
yourself why is it bad

128
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,589
well just makes my job a little bit
easier or so now I just know what OS

129
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,819
what web server version the database
version you're using so basically

130
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:24,589
possible for me to use its operations to
go look up without a date a server

131
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:30,899
running in genetics PHP we just go to
our old friend exploit database lookup

132
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,029
the version number and pretty much pop
out a bunch of stuff you'd be surprised

133
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:36,899
at how much

134
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,410
really old stuff people have out there
production there's people that are still

135
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:50,368
using I sex you know really outdated
versions of you know PHP personal

136
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:56,920
favorite is you know we all we all know
WordPress those are always fun to find

137
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,309
out there in the wild so kind of why I
always recommended do I get generic type

138
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:11,610
of message as opposed to doing just the
one that pops up when when you install

139
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,970
windows this one

140
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,730
WebDAV enabled basically this was
enabled by default lot of the older

141
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:28,040
versions you don't really see it enabled
by default and more people for some

142
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,349
reason still turn it on and and
production this one's pretty fun

143
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:43,220
defiance what can I do with it I can
edit files you can edit files you can

144
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:53,939
deface websites but still a remote code
execution and then I found a really fun

145
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:59,480
tool that will enable you to the
defacing websites just find web dads

146
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,309
enabled download the tall he pointed out
the server and you can kind of put

147
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:10,019
whatever jpg you want married Dorcas
completely deface the site area and we

148
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:17,809
still see these on a daily basis again
don't turn it on my personal favorites

149
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:21,870
local file inclusion to one of my
personal favorites

150
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,749
why is this bad basically gathered
usernames go ahead and look at the

151
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:34,779
password file can harvest useful
information from the log files like say

152
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:41,089
Apache logs are not log she logs access
logs and you can actually remotely

153
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,029
execute commands by combining
responsibility with some other attack

154
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:48,019
that damaged such as file upload
vulnerabilities or

155
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,110
log injection when the best example
something like this is the Joomla

156
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,429
component vulnerability basically you
can just get a cross-site scripting

157
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:05,399
attacks off without you can do some
other nasty stuff as well then I think

158
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,759
my personal personal favorite is the
content type is not specified

159
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:16,470
this one is actually very low
vulnerability called informational and

160
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,449
as you can see you know there's no
content type specified whatsoever in a

161
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:30,609
response or NEC CSP set up as well so
basically ContentType was not specified

162
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:39,179
you definitely gonna have a bad time and
basically so failure to explicitly

163
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:44,790
specify the type of the contents are by
the requested resource could allow an

164
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,149
attacker or attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting attacks by

165
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:52,540
exploiting the inconsistencies in
content sniffing techniques employed by

166
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:58,689
the browser and can also be the gateway
to unrestricted file upload I'm so this

167
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:07,079
one is a is a perfect example of just
recently somebody was looking at CNN's

168
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:15,908
and Facebook they are actually able to
bypass the filters through the CDN to go

169
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:21,959
ahead and upload a file to Facebook to
get a cross-site scripting attack so

170
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,929
this would be the best example would be
like putting up a file so instead of

171
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:33,820
like evil . PHP I just change the file
extension to its so evil . PHP died JPEG

172
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:42,320
file servers not checking the file and
basically you upload that you get a

173
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,080
shell right now on your site

174
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
another good one too is

175
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,158
just recently doing business logic tests
we are able to instead of the site was

176
00:17:54,159 --> 00:18:01,620
in enforcing UTF 8 wiews UTF 16 we
bypassed their login we're able to get

177
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,639
the file upload and we actually got a
hanging pointer and we were able to go

178
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,610
in and actually started bleeding the
customer CSS files we probably could've

179
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,760
done worse but you know it was a POC we
weren't in there trying to do too much

180
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,760
damage so that one was a lot of sign

181
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:26,330
basically the two armed didn't read
version basically we covered the

182
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:32,158
differences between network security and
application security showed you see

183
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,659
examples below the median and imploring
Boehner abilities and how they could be

184
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:41,450
used so basically in short don't
discount vulnerabilities just because it

185
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,029
is ranked low by your scanner knowing
your application is cheap and personally

186
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:53,019
I think you know I think I've talked to
see views is just trying to work more

187
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:58,600
with with developers of our applications
to go ahead and try to get them more

188
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,029
involved in security let them know that
they are also involved in that a lot

189
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:11,470
invested in the security of the web
applications so that you know we have

190
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:17,440
less time to do things nowadays so we
can get the web dev team that I T teens

191
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,870
and everybody else to cut a bitch and
realize that securities is something

192
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,729
that everybody needs to deal with just
the security people then I think it'll

193
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,740
make our lives a lot easier and so
basically you know knowing is half the

194
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,830
battle

195
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,678
so it probably blew through this way too
quickly

196
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:43,770
so does anybody have any questions or
comments or anything that they want to

197
00:19:43,770 --> 00:20:14,650
talk about right now does anybody wanna
come up in another shot record I mean

198
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,580
that tends to be the whole thing is is
we have to investigate a little bit more

199
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,090
than kinda look at how the web
application works in kind of look at

200
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,490
where that that live on durability
finding is i mean you know we're all

201
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,030
going to see a lot of static tends to be
a little bit harder to figure that stuff

202
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:38,580
out sometimes but I mean you know
looking at the web as a whole

203
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,908
you know doing static analysis on it as
well as during dynamic analysis on it

204
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,010
and then kind of just trying to fill the
holes I mean that's really all we can

205
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:53,830
really do is mainly I think my point is
is that I think we just can't go ahead

206
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,939
and discount everything you know it's
easier to do that you know when we're

207
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,919
looking at like a TCP time stamp on the
network that's one thing but when we're

208
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,039
looking at like you know not not doing
you know content filtering or anything

209
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,929
like that on a webpage I mean it's a
completely different thing they just has

210
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:18,280
a higher impact so it's just you know I
think it's it's a point of getting the

211
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:25,470
death teams more involved in the process
of getting them to map out the map out

212
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,030
the application to look more like you
know the pitfalls of the vulnerabilities

213
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,030
that there that there churning out with
her coat

214
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:46,860
tools I mean you know you've got a lot
out there like very good you got check

215
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,899
marks you've got you know as far as like
static analysis HP has static analysis

216
00:21:52,900 --> 00:22:00,530
tools will you know you're also looking
at the stools you know like obviously

217
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:07,060
I'm on a spider teams plug my products
are not supposed to but hey whatever you

218
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,530
know and there's tons a test holes out
there as well and you know this is late

219
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,230
said last talked

220
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,820
awesome organization involved in I love
going there made ups you know their

221
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,830
their mantra is definitely you know
secure code so you know i i definitely

222
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:31,149
always recommend having people get more
involved in that looking at the release

223
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,830
guides looking at the documentation just
to try to you know be be better about

224
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,310
you know what we're coding and then lets
you know churning out into a production

225
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:54,800
environment than a little bit early
there is still half a bottle of Jack

226
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:02,280
appear here in New Orleans it's free
free booze so come on up and you know

227
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,899
thanks for coming in listening to me
