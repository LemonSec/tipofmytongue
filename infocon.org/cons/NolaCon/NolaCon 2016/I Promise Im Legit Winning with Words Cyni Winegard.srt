1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,730
she was really like to talk by yourself
but I managed to get here so why you are

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,710
here this is a technical conference and
really social engineering music really

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,029
technical it's talking to people which
is not nearly as cool as circumventing

4
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,810
firewall but what if I told you that a
couple weeks ago

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,719
one billion dollar credit union let me
walk in completely unauthorized didn't

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,820
even check and I D

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,540
let me say that one of their cubicles
and plug into their network all while I

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,860
wasn't supposed to be there that is a
great

9
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,110
for grad school and got promoted to
assistant admin I did systems

10
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,870
administration for two years and a
little bit programming and systems

11
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,890
analysis and after that I can trade
security where I've been for two years I

12
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,890
fell in love with the industry kind of
awesome workout announcers and secretary

13
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:40,930
now I want to track and pedophiles owner
likes cheney I did not start off in

14
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,490
information security at all actually
start off and English and linguistics

15
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,960
major then became way too relevant to my
life and I decided I wanted to pay check

16
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,149
up went to college so I went to the
University of Arkansas at about this

17
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,490
time

18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,369
Peter science while I was there to get
RFID security class and totally fun let

19
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:05,490
the industry I jumped right in became an
information security analyst just well

20
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:13,070
in this role he performed tests risk
assessment I T on its way to a bar

21
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,370
melody scanning and of course social
engineering engagements so far completed

22
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,470
sixty-plus social engineering as
yesterday this is everything from

23
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:32,329
walking there now that you know about us
why here so if you don't know

24
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,700
anthropology at the study of human
beings so it's actually really really

25
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,290
useful in social engineering and if
y'all ever wanna go totally can come

26
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:48,140
find me a couple of hours but I could
keep it contained a biological

27
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,250
anthropology addresses like evolutionary
character trait involuntary color

28
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,750
changing and social cultural
anthropology actually addresses like

29
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,410
social class and gender which really
important that I used and the quality

30
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:09,380
and they did in my background liberal
arts also really helps I need to know

31
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,790
how to craft just the right phrase for a
professional-looking documents and

32
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,920
know-how somebody's going to react to me
it's character analysis

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,010
another thing that has been really
useful is that I was a theater kid high

34
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,620
school if you're really serious about
doing social engineering I would suggest

35
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,030
he and processes whose line is it anyway

36
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,030
actually a really good training exercise

37
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:38,569
make sure that you can react no matter
what's thrown at you talk about why

38
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,540
these non technical things are really
important so where is this actually

39
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:51,540
gotten so far and my fishing projects
I've got a total of seven effective user

40
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,048
credentials username and password

41
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,390
the thing that people tell you never to
give out over the phone condition never

42
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:04,569
gonna ask for it while I got that five
of them or Active Directory and two of

43
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,079
them were for the quarter financial
processor

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,350
earlier with financial institutions
financial processor is the fifth and

45
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:20,209
they're pretty much the car and you may
be thinking what does that matter how

46
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:28,010
you that while they all get their extra
well all I had to do it I just need a

47
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,219
little bit of anti-war

48
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,300
thing and a little bit of changing and i
got a pretty easily I'm pretty socially

49
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,090
awkward as a whole but I would much
rather have someone for their password

50
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:47,810
because I know that way I can tell this
isn't just you know there's no place

51
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,590
that totally sucks this we have done
this on multiple occasions walked in and

52
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,849
out of a bunch of branches and I have
even come back the next day after I

53
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,680
compromise for locations I came back as
myself as a different assessment I had

54
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,360
to run and the manager that talk to the
day before didn't know I still was not

55
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,580
mediate compliance consultant she was
just like oh you know you're coming

56
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,669
again today

57
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:22,299
you know is there more stuff me to do
she didn't know until after I left and

58
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,650
there I T manager told them we find lots
of other sensitive information while

59
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,560
you're in there people love to leave
things on printers on lot puters been a

60
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,460
lot of mail rooms where they just go
ahead and hang out in the mail room with

61
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:45,900
your giant bag and certainly not going
to disappear so it's important to note

62
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,840
it in case anybody in here don't let no
I think most of us do social engineering

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,810
is the exploitation of human psychology
in order to accomplish a goal or as I

64
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,099
like to call people and you can have
their psychology thing can't be worth

65
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:10,000
and mouth instead of a firewall and it's
far easier than $2 host a working on it

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,099
there are three or four types of social
engineering depending on who you talk to

67
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:19,800
first one's fishing this is the most
common this is all your spam emails for

68
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,930
spearfishing

69
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:27,280
got target like at Sony then there's
indirect this one contested people say

70
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,130
it's not really social cause you're not
talking to anybody but this information

71
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:38,270
gathering dumpster diving even things
like leaving a USB in a parking lot or

72
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,510
handing them out of the security people
will flood the men because it's nice to

73
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:52,380
be here mainly talking now about fishing
which is boys fishing this is done over

74
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,090
the phone

75
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:59,169
normally either to get information like
credentials or to get someone to pay for

76
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,710
services they really don't need then we
have the physical which we also call on

77
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,830
site and this is where we actually go on
site and try and reach a physical

78
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:18,250
location so have you guys ever heard of
the Trojan horse not the computer virus

79
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,919
but the real ACT or SAT social
engineering that like a lot of our

80
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,440
people still calling for you think that
they learn well

81
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,979
very tight I'm sure you could experience
stereotyping in the industry

82
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:40,460
kind of a big deal hackers hackers all
look the same and there are more

83
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,479
important than you think

84
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:48,870
when it comes to social service
typically women have girl jobs teachers

85
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,229
not happy here and Bethany are generally
more successful because we are females

86
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:01,039
and it depleted evolutionary trait gone
that the anthropology and it makes users

87
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,400
trust us simply because when women are
generally quite maternal

88
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:16,859
people so it helps a lot like a lot but
we will address how to get around

89
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:26,800
science at the moment we can't really do
anything to protect you from humans are

90
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,659
trustworthy and helpful by nature even
if you're not immediately truck but we

91
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:39,929
still want to feel something venturing
out a train wreck happened partly so why

92
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:46,750
everybody slows down and social
engineers could step further and give us

93
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,829
social psychological reasons to trust
them like having company for example you

94
00:08:52,829 --> 00:09:06,540
can actually really think you can beat
everybody in here to picture a and non

95
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,829
industry person think the social
engineer or a hacker looks like what

96
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:15,010
gender or they wouldn't their age with
the rain how did the rest

97
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:23,420
what is our stereotypes because people
be there are stereotypes that be the

98
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,800
people let everyone thinks we look like
what do you notice about what you know

99
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,449
about age gender everything I mentioned
in the beginning

100
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,430
young age

101
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,609
socially awkward looking like male

102
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:52,489
suffer very pale moving toward being
racially extended but we've known you

103
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,240
know for a little while women and pop
culture like to mention they always show

104
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,110
up at the surprise villain hacker at the
end

105
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:11,560
people usually disregard them and still
can't believe that I couldn't front of a

106
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,109
computer all day with three XY
everywhere you know we're pretty sure

107
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,870
she's speaking in tongues

108
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:31,790
actually on his first day my dog I
introduced myself and he was like that

109
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:41,670
sales person think but yeah my client I
had one point who chose the AT&T network

110
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:50,469
technician review the project because I
did look for and why did the freaking

111
00:10:50,470 --> 00:11:02,240
CEO was like why did you pick AT&T bill
won't hire girl technician so most

112
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,890
people do consciously and you can't help
it

113
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,670
and a couple operation that have gone
over right now if you do fit the

114
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:21,709
stereotype you can use that to your
advantage for how you carry yourself and

115
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,709
your body language things like that and
you should be good to go

116
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,010
which go into right now everything
starts with you you have to convince

117
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:41,160
yourself and you need to choose a cover
story that's not only good for the

118
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,480
target but that's good for you I went to
school to be a programmer software go

119
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:54,089
you throw hardware in front of me around
however I did a part time job for six

120
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,420
years of being a worker and a
disabilities office

121
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,070
compliance consultant ruse is really
really good for me about accommodations

122
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,440
all day long for you your own knowledge
if you have a background in something

123
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,680
use it as well talk a lot about truths
and using troops under cover story and

124
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:23,399
that's actually really important and
even the plane expectations

125
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,899
another reason why the network to her
role doesn't work great for me because I

126
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,930
am I don't fit the stereotype typical
network tech that everybody thinks

127
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,540
obviously calls can be network tech and
if you think otherwise

128
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,940
somehow you what if you play along to
the expectation they're gonna believe

129
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,970
you a lot

130
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,930
disability accommodations typically it's
in a moment to you know take care of

131
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,880
other people which is all combinations
that going along with people don't

132
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,070
question

133
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:08,290
those are the big things down to the
details though he you don't need to know

134
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:14,780
your fake mothers make great your
nonexistent child is if you have too

135
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:24,560
many details you're going to trip over
your so here we use props used them

136
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,199
carefully I mean if you're an
exterminator you don't need to show up

137
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,100
with a work load of construction tools
now you're not going to chase the

138
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:41,290
termites around with us all when I am
compliance consultant normally I have a

139
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:51,000
fake I D a clipboard I'm sorry we're
still doesn't work and checklist but I

140
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,690
printed Google clothing is very very
important what I do I dress business

141
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,620
casual I have some workers though that
they do the pest control lot so they've

142
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,320
gotten polos logo embroidered on them
that's great if you can do that you have

143
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,990
the funds for it but really just using
the idea of the uniform can't work if

144
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,870
you don't believe that just having the
right colors will trick people put on a

145
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,080
blue shirt and khakis and try to go
shopping at Walmart you get asked a lot

146
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:37,440
of questions many pet grooming when
again I'm a consultant you know I have

147
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,340
my hair back all night I got modest
jewelry low key makeup that's expected

148
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:49,740
or female business people but if I am a
network tech I have a messy bun I'm have

149
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,320
no makeup whatsoever and I'm gonna look
completely different because of it and

150
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,430
it doesn't just have to do with girls so
guys you know if you have a big unruly

151
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,680
beard are a whole lot of tax choose you
know you don't fit the stereotype

152
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,380
insurance inspector however you know the
pest control guy somebody coming to give

153
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:24,260
up paint a painting you know those are
great bruises and then we have some fun

154
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:31,319
like color psychology where you can come
up with your shirt star is actually

155
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,899
really great example could think of all
the colors of light sabers thus if all

156
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:42,860
have read which is a very passionate
energetic angry color and then you have

157
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,390
Luke who has blues and greens which are
really calming you know the good light

158
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:54,459
side of the force you can do this by
just the color of what you're wearing

159
00:15:54,459 --> 00:16:00,779
typically I like to choose calming
colors like blue or green or purple

160
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:07,939
because blue shows off you know
professional very calm but not purple

161
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,709
sky at Royal you know respectable Brown
is actually really good because it shows

162
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:20,260
your reliable but you don't want to go
monochrome unless you're trying to be

163
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:28,130
the UPS guy cuz you look like a
generally I just choose a button down in

164
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,270
that color and then just plain black
slacks black

165
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:39,140
he looked very professional but you
still are giving out the color so when

166
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,520
the obvious person modifications that
you making there's one real gold in line

167
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,660
with you you want to get your target to
trust you they will comply and those

168
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,890
things like that before humans are more
stranger and stranger get the nether

169
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:59,870
region you can trust you first
impressions I'm sure you've all heard by

170
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,300
now you all probably interview before
they're incredibly important how many

171
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,409
people you know

172
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:14,220
straight interested have a really strong
handshake but think about the science

173
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:29,880
behind the ball body has anybody ever
giving you advice about your face before

174
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,080
even seeing your body language and how
you carry yourself people look at your

175
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,090
face and human psychology dictate that
humans react different facial features

176
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:49,810
so used to study and a psychologist down
that facial structure to give someone an

177
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:55,149
idea of your personality like you have a
baby face you'll be really good at

178
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:01,580
dodging hearing anything but probably
masculine feel like the military justice

179
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,500
you'll just make people think that you
are in my first day on the job

180
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:17,070
one of the guys was like I cannot wait
to kiss you look so precious and women

181
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,419
with this topic they tend to be more
successful in health care education or

182
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,420
whatever caregiver role because they
look mattel and unfortunately for some

183
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,410
of us to anyone and includes attractive
people are still not attractive people

184
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,800
haven't outgoing friendly personality in
addition to being really intelligent and

185
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,879
socially complement its subconscious
thing nothing to do with

186
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,780
another theory done by Charles Darwin
said that your personality actually hits

187
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:55,230
your face in the Russell 2000 but one
could use more prominent

188
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:02,770
you smile off the muscles that you smile
more prominent here really happy that

189
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,220
mean well if you know your face and
trustworthy

190
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,910
smile March

191
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:18,530
not part and it's actually fun like a
school play sports are really you

192
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:25,350
thought if you can see this picture
having an upturn mouth and eyebrows

193
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:32,560
gives off like a more trustworthy and if
that is online just google it look at

194
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,320
what it looks like a pretty good
practice in the mirror like relax a

195
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,780
little bit raise your eyebrows lips
while more you know

196
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:51,710
friendlier yeah if you ask somebody is
my face trustworthy and they got ya know

197
00:19:51,710 --> 00:20:00,360
which alright once you get the structure
of your face down we have to talk about

198
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:07,740
expressions there are two kinds of macro
and micro micro expressions are often

199
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:15,190
involved and voluntary which makes the
most dangerous this is little thing you

200
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,510
know the widening of the really supposed
to be there and somebody let you in on

201
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:26,540
the first try and you look surprised
that's a problem even just like a pic of

202
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,730
your eyebrows

203
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,730
signalled to the target something wrong

204
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:41,059
control but you have to disappear for
you have to practice it's very easy to

205
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,129
tell if somebody has a fake expression
especially if you're up against women

206
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:49,399
I'm really sorry guys but scientifically
proven that women are better reading

207
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:54,758
facial expressions the men tend to be
whenever your girlfriend says oh that

208
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:04,450
person was upset you know they're fine
that's part of it so here you know you

209
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,019
want to get these under control and
trust you this is more practicing in the

210
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,479
mirror but also more improv

211
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:20,029
have a friend saying things to you that
a target might fade you denials yes it

212
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,450
is letting you in case you need to see
this and learn how to react

213
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,450
appropriately

214
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:38,760
once you've got your yet their work on
your body language mutation is 55% my

215
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,090
language choices only 77 percent of it

216
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,870
your tone is another 38 percent and
we'll talk a little more about that in a

217
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,260
bit if you wanna be sick same supercar
inspire trust you know you do the whole

218
00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:00,160
and argue that great shelters you know
this shows your trustworthy doing

219
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:07,350
sometimes it's good to look sympathetic
so kinda looking to that can actually

220
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,760
work really well for you pay attention
to your hands they actually tell a lot

221
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,040
about you

222
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,510
twitching and tapping showing Saudi
touching your face

223
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:26,200
thought years indecision my big problem
is I miss my hair which guarantee I

224
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,030
actually do have anxiety so they've been
doing that alot without thinking about

225
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,740
it and set trying to suppress it which
would be actually really hard for me to

226
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:41,300
do I work it into my contest you know
somebody notices hey you're really

227
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,300
twenty you know why do you look so
nervous

228
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,750
say something like oh I'm sorry I knew
this is my first time by myself you know

229
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,750
I'm just kinda nervous they don't screw
it up

230
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:01,500
people love to help out the new person
and you can use to manage to arms making

231
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,490
really how I see how your target reacts
to you you know if they're protecting

232
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:12,380
their they might kill their crossing
their arms you know they're hiding

233
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,260
something or they don't want to talk and
now putting your hands on your hips

234
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:27,620
generally means you're upset so this was
something I did even before I got into

235
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,780
this job I used to go to options

236
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,500
my father a lot and he would always tell
me that carry the heavy stuff while he

237
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:47,950
and the reason that was me bak you help
me get into the car carrying a gun safe

238
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:56,690
for me and it would be loaded before he
even finished but if you can't handle in

239
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,940
distress think it sometimes it looks
really weird

240
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:06,260
mirroring can be consciously picking up
their target and most people here

241
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,540
thinking about it but if you are
thinking about it you can use it to your

242
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:17,440
advantage because people like himself at
the subconscious thing it gives you a

243
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,110
sense of comfort or connection or below
and you definitely don't want do it

244
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:30,909
exactly the weekend we're really like it
and then they're so while not

245
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,410
immediately speaking to each other even
facing each other these four men are

246
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,000
nearing

247
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,830
all have their hand out there that I do
it when I'm on this project when their

248
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:50,159
car hit space to think about higher
sometimes all I know is that I usually

249
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,760
work like this and where their body
language and you can also appears beach

250
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,800
to get someone to fill your connection
which is so cool when you're actually

251
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
doing it and you can tell that it's
working

252
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,900
you can hear the tone of voice the speed
and a word choice and they'll change to

253
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,960
marry you back he'll go over a little
bit cold but we don't do it word for

254
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,400
word because then you will know that
you're copying them he said the exact

255
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,150
words they use it most and fishing with
its more fluid that weight and keeping

256
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,130
your your target first when they answer
the phone so I have like a party girl

257
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,490
that all answer the phone I'll change my
voice of work you know you've been named

258
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,120
like actually pretty Rachel and they
were

259
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,429
more likely to I don't know what it is
someone you okey dokey here great when

260
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,220
they're talking to you could say
something like alrighty are perfect

261
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,000
symbol or something but they're not
exact but don't do it if you're in

262
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:01,490
service all right so that really brings
into focus on questions first

263
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,910
ok we have open ended question these are
used to gather specific information

264
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,320
about someone something actually
something that they teach you a dialogue

265
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,950
also there's a lot of these kind of
these kind of questions in both

266
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,910
interrogation sales techniques which
kind of funny how those two para

267
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:30,640
open-ended question that's when your
instead of asking a yes-no question you

268
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,760
ask something that forces you to think
more like a so saying do you like John

269
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,090
Johnson just leave it that he say how do
you feel about John Johnson they're

270
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:50,919
gonna have to tell you then we have
leading question they can be a target a

271
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,750
specific direction

272
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,600
lots lots of sales and interrogation
techniques here instead of like to just

273
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,780
say something about my visit is a yes or
no question you did say we are able to

274
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,940
be the email that Jim sent out about my
inspection today at least on the think

275
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,320
there was an email

276
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,929
dotnet and they should have known about
this inspection

277
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,919
many of us some questions this is
generally when you have a really good

278
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,200
educated guess I should have information
it can be either used to gain trust

279
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,740
because you're right

280
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:36,210
all are in order to verify information
like if you go up and ask somebody yeah

281
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,320
right you're saying somebody's told you

282
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,660
firewall if the answer is yes oh yeah
you know about the network it's it's

283
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,990
about the network with them if they say
no you know

284
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,930
Sophos firewall then they're going to
one give you more information I know

285
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,980
exactly what kind of a lot of times will
be like who told you that you know now

286
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,670
let's get everything right

287
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:14,550
delegate and devote more information
they are and he want to imply hopeful

288
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,659
this you do not want to just go what is
your password

289
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,840
probably won't work if it does they
definitely deserve to be there and so

290
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:34,500
did everything get their trials yeah
people generally don't like being

291
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,590
something be demanded of them so in this
sort of cases have saying what's your

292
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:47,300
username say hey can you verify this
user name so I can make sure that I'm

293
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:52,680
talking to the right person or for the
password can you verify your password

294
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,380
for me so I can cross yup this list I
make sure not to call you again nobody

295
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,680
wants to be called twice and you sound
like you're helping them by then giving

296
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,470
you a password

297
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,880
you know they're doing something good
for them so not something terrible for

298
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,000
the entire nation you want you don't
bombard you with questions that might

299
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,080
make them shut down so you have to again

300
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,600
balance get just the right amount of
questions to get what you need and move

301
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,399
on

302
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:33,830
we have this is about how you speak in
general there's a technique called

303
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,460
positive confrontation this is just
making a strong and that Stern's

304
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,970
statement said walking and CEO in today
you can walk up and say I'm an

305
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:49,320
appointment with Tim Cook at 11 a.m.
that says you know tempo you have an

306
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,330
appointment and it's important and they
better hurry up and get you this is

307
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:05,360
being assertive without being aggressive
wedding falls back more on gender

308
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,350
differences John law in his book
outdoors and actually called tools and

309
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,600
duets talks about how guys when they
interact with each other they tend to

310
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,939
duel with their friends which is just
teasing them about something you know

311
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,420
things women would probably never say to
each other like oh my god where those

312
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:36,530
shoes look terrible or did you hear this
morning and it's playful is typically

313
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:42,660
between women people think a lot of guys
think that we're interrupting each other

314
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,620
when we're talking one person will say
oh you know this happen to me and the

315
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,360
other on will go oh yeah this very
similar thing happened to me it's

316
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,229
actually do wedding it's keeping the
conversation going and finding common

317
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,530
grounds and actually its defensive check
me because if you give personal

318
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:06,950
information out that person could use
them against against you but if they get

319
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:12,400
something bad you both have that black
male so you know your stuff is safe

320
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,670
white people tend to if you develop
something personal

321
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,250
they want to give it back give something
personal about themselves

322
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,250
seized on the ground

323
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:32,459
typically like work do a whole lot more
than I do normally cuz I'm surrounded by

324
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,280
guys were the only female

325
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:46,240
yeah there we take very qualities are
stalking statements which is another

326
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,210
thing women do a lot this is a way of
making a statement

327
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,290
gentler so that you don't push them into
defensive alright confrontation program

328
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:05,830
called them being diplomatic diplomatic
and search saying you know like yours

329
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:11,100
you set this up for all said something
like I might be wrong but I think this

330
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
configure it

331
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,939
rationed setting should be this and not
this gets them to go oh you're hoping

332
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,920
you're not saying you turn them on and
they actually think about what you're

333
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:36,610
doing and are more likely to fix it can
bring back to anthropology I love you so

334
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:43,179
one of those deeper into that we can
talk about the stress think local it it

335
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,210
makes a lot of sense when you think
about it there's a chance that you'll

336
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:52,890
see each other around town or you know
friends of their friends or family maybe

337
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,160
we'll go job one day so people don't
want to have awkward encounters with

338
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:08,410
each other each other because the
conflict so a lot of us in here from

339
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:14,440
cell which we had some pretty unique way
of thinking how he appeared local to

340
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,860
other people start with your boy it's
probably the easiest method to tell

341
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,879
where people usually a certain way
forward

342
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,770
critically

343
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:34,360
I don't know if you haven't noticed I
tend to pick up a midwestern accent

344
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:43,760
so it's hard to imitate but if you can
and use that to your advantage though

345
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,540
are you call someone else but when in
doubt you want to use your natural

346
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:57,100
accents because that that can get you in
like an idiot legally we also have

347
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,820
regional terms things I catch myself
really hard not to when I go up north

348
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:11,520
because yes that is a flag you're not
and that's incredibly difficult even

349
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,630
small things like same soda pop can get
you in trouble someplace I got made fun

350
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:25,690
of Anansi Asian is also if you go
somewhere and you don't know how to

351
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:31,560
pronounce either ask the local that has
nothing to do with your situation are

352
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,870
announcing it whatsoever I mean and
Louisiana it is really easy to tell it's

353
00:34:37,870 --> 00:35:00,060
a year or so and yeah I'm not tell me
that word most enriching but when you

354
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,620
say that you just move here or you're
going to school year with something that

355
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:12,569
I before I went to my first project and
we the guy was training that we should

356
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:18,030
probably try to look local it was
November and I'm from Miami Florida so

357
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:24,270
do the accent so I just said that I went
to school there it might work out in

358
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:30,370
your favor of you that you sent me very
welcoming people think what people say

359
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:40,950
so what happens if they think well
before you even start your test you want

360
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,950
to plan for like think about everything
that happened what pop more than I'll

361
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,730
still get

362
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:51,450
and plan for them I've made a pic you
check with inward with the local I found

363
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,919
on Google and if someone says they will
not give me physical access from my

364
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:07,030
insurance can you please just answer
questions make it look like I did not

365
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:12,750
have a silent alarm the dye packs but
they're all really catching but I have

366
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:20,950
to like how many disabled parking but
you have even if that fails I have a

367
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:25,529
signature line so if they're like I
can't answer those questions can you

368
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,300
just fine if I can tell my boss here and
I'll give me a signature which is also

369
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:41,680
really bad idea you can also plan things
like that no man I have five locations

370
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,680
that happened and you don't have time to
wait for confirmation

371
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:53,100
anything we can do I get giving you
something

372
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,850
fan difference which is something that
kevin Mitnick for I could do whatever

373
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,400
you want to be here

374
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,550
here but you don't have to say that I
think walk out the door because then he

375
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:16,040
ok fine by me just want to have a reason
to just relax and not be alarmed if

376
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:24,190
that's when you leave I'll give them a
reason to think that you don't really

377
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:32,770
care about getting there and if all else
fails you're probably doing overall I

378
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:39,800
hadn't hear ya well if you get too pushy
regret he could trigger warning bell

379
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,800
call the cops

380
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:59,650
and what do you get away from the topic
but you want to build rapport rapport

381
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,250
and trust will get you what you want and
what better way to do that is to be

382
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:12,900
genuine and I don't like most people so
this is really hard for a human being I

383
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,760
would smile and pretend to care more
about them than anything else I really

384
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,320
care about your password so you know get
to the degree here and get your passport

385
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:28,450
everyone likes to talk about themselves
and also make sure that my parents but

386
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:36,580
my demeanor technician but I'm a really
small female Soper keep its kinda well I

387
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:44,600
don't do intimidating looking so I tried
to pick ax they'll fit my

388
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,970
grapevine

389
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:55,839
don't look that up if you're a really
big dude and you said that you look

390
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:02,700
intimidating you can do it I did and you
can change your demeanor and you have an

391
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:10,200
input petty verify what I don't know
what it is and you don't talk about

392
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,850
yourself you don't want to avoid it at
all costs because that's incredibly

393
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:20,569
people be like why is this person but
you want to be more interested in what

394
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:28,320
they have to say which you can be anyway
because they're probably going and try

395
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,610
to find this is so you can take
advantage of your surroundings and look

396
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,250
around their debt what they're wearing
you know maybe if you see like a picture

397
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,890
of a dog or something like a lot of
pictures of dog chat about it even if

398
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:47,440
you don't have a dog make one up they
might think that there's a chance that

399
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,960
they'll see you at the dog park later on
because your local and they will bend

400
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,890
over backwards to be accommodating
because they don't operate social

401
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,060
interests are really powerful

402
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:09,950
and one of the most common mistake you
can make it over thinking when I did all

403
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:16,680
the time and not just I get around that
usually in such a project because I

404
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,940
don't speak out and pulls hand I go with
the flow of the situation around I just

405
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,590
watched think tank

406
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:31,310
potentially be over thank you can make
three body language or you can't

407
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:43,090
overthink things well you want to keep
that balance in mind when you when

408
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,730
you're planning out your paycheck if you
work too hard on your details like

409
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,230
loading up on crops like Bethany

410
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:54,510
her thing i think thats trip you'll come
off at rehearsal and natural people be

411
00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:01,780
quiet but I'm sure you can tell which
parts of our scripts are brand new ones

412
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:08,660
we've been working on for a while we
finish the morning so surprised

413
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,380
figures that we had to go

414
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:21,320
don't don't rehearse at all in one trip
usually what I do and professional

415
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,770
engineering our her sippy different
things and I won't actually know what to

416
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:32,700
tell them that way you don't you still
know if they don't sound rehearse and

417
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:41,520
that it's taking so so is your pre-tax
gone wrong

418
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,910
talk through it and act like he wanted
that where you really really useful for

419
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:54,379
the more trees that you haven't heard
that the more not feeling protect will

420
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:02,220
be like that we also had a very very
quickly have a tendency to blush really

421
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:11,700
easy and when people from either case
I'm so sorry that sits alongside and

422
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,700
really nervous right now I get nervous

423
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:23,990
and i get some which some people be like
oh sorry let me help you feel better ok

424
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:35,359
and finally forced the best body
language to me to change it felt really

425
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,320
easy and it can be packing and find
think about it right

426
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,990
a lot of people don't think about it
like a network social engineering can be

427
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:49,259
done at work and you can think about it
like a network navigating through human

428
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,580
psychology

429
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:55,390
security controls Right changing your
talent and your body language and your

430
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:00,790
demeanor to be like pooping an address
to bypass the DHCP filter works nothing

431
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:18,250
like that I can be happy if you put it
all together we mention and do a little

432
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:30,320
research on doing a lot more and it
would like a list of references or if

433
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:36,160
you like about anything we have talked
to both of us and we will be around

434
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:48,859
afterwards probably get so we like to
thank you everyone for coming
