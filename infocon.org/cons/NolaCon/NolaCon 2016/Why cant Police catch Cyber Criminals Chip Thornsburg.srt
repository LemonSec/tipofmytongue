1
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,650
i'm just reading your

2
00:00:50,410 --> 00:01:05,289
I'm in Egypt but I woke up and actually
city below to find a support service

3
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,880
their own a company called out on
cybersecurity

4
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:27,369
primarily work bodyguards so did you
make sarcasm

5
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:40,560
by Chris Haack something that looked
like that mental state university that

6
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:54,039
is nice big thing in line to get the
disclaimer specific case information

7
00:01:54,039 --> 00:02:15,900
contact well as we cannot be tails the
cost of cybercrime to share with you

8
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:25,650
guys want give you some real talk about
cybercrime we tend to focus on the

9
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:33,520
celebrated cases you see the news in
brandsmart scares and that in our

10
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,849
databases pretty where we don't deal
with things like to give you an idea of

11
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:46,959
what longworth deal with some of the
challenges that we face and then

12
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:58,060
hopefully get you doing with that
awesome cybercrime

13
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:08,060
and where one trillion dollars and
reason about that later on that's a

14
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:16,630
pretty broad range quite simply we don't
know how much we do know that on average

15
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,700
about a hundred and sixty set tax which
just last month

16
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:32,690
five million voters records Philippines
93 million records in mexico not a place

17
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:46,340
that I was the actor about 11 million
users can rest of our attacks healthcare

18
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:54,010
school districts by the way they
actually just for us to look at that say

19
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,340
that crazy all the other talks are
designed around that site prevent that

20
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,840
in mind some point bad things are gonna
happen probably gonna have to call one

21
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:14,049
and then the real problems action start
that they recognize that and we interact

22
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:29,250
as have directed you know their minds
Penelope very good at beer I could see a

23
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,810
sign so when you think about long
capabilities this web right high-tech

24
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:41,550
here's what is the reality is more like
even know who this is the original

25
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,960
dragnet 1967 something about that

26
00:04:49,160 --> 00:05:01,090
excellent care uprise again 1968 one of
the biggest challenges that awkward

27
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,960
places you tend to identify with things
in your teens were exposed to so the

28
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,900
people running right now

29
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,409
guess where they were watching on TV
dragnet well that's their experience

30
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:25,890
that's what I thought processes reality
in this room and its operands it's just

31
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:35,080
what we talked about cybercrime tend to
break it down to different areas person

32
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:43,310
is used as a target of attack and so we
have things like they're reaching parity

33
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,310
fraud intellectual property

34
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:59,409
child molestation of minor cyberbullying
is simply harassment somalis that we all

35
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,590
dealt with except now use something new

36
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:14,650
the second way that we tended you may
have evidence so even investigations

37
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:22,530
murder investigations sexual assaults
burglaries narcotics drug offenses

38
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:31,780
credit card debit card users record
revenue from awkward fact it's fine that

39
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:46,760
we can build the case by the way the
murder in the last year we tend to talk

40
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,990
about computer networks and servers
thing but guaranteed everybody in your

41
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,650
tablet's huge

42
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:11,270
evidence that you break it down these
individual victims and then for perfect

43
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:21,700
people tend to run across pretty good
loss identity stolen credit cards are

44
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,500
cracking and then ransomware pretty

45
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:39,219
you've ever had to deal with that indeed
that one person that is crazy like one

46
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:51,240
else will talk that that's what it
really so you're

47
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,120
identity so you pick up phone call 911

48
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,919
some of my stuff and we're gonna send
out our crack investigator for the

49
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:19,190
specialized reality is especially since
end up in a prolapse for most part you

50
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:26,229
know what they are not they do not have
the specialized training or experience

51
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:31,830
to release your cyber a lot of times it
is right there you're going

52
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:49,850
crimes what I do and I like you know
where you at this is actually a real

53
00:08:49,850 --> 00:09:50,089
case report that was sent over to me on
so much your place and that yes I

54
00:09:50,089 --> 00:10:10,070
sarcastic but a lot of time is actually
the wet out there so I worked there were

55
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:18,540
332,000 reports of a in the United
States seven million Americans sixteen

56
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:29,500
to eighteen billion dollars in Los the
last 10 actually back to resolve the

57
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,060
route the bank is in the habit you call
them and say my cart

58
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:48,560
like ours that the money back but that
why you're no longer you got your money

59
00:10:48,560 --> 00:11:04,020
so person who was really unless you have
the special need psychological it's hard

60
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,560
to get a return after the bank get some
money and so probably our second

61
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,160
challenge is the overlapping last case

62
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:28,810
Carolina money stolen or his card
numbers card is used to Texas three

63
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,979
places three different counties three
different cities got a pile of different

64
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,740
82 take that best get it

65
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:43,420
and let's not forget that the victim
doesn't like victim anymore so were

66
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,620
business thanks that's right off guard
somebody a little bit more on know

67
00:11:50,620 --> 00:12:08,910
anybody heard of personal experience I
was shocked you're so you're

68
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,300
investigating research darkness that so
many guys who don't know what part

69
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:22,459
Gregory yes first of all set up this is
the target victim market very young

70
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,850
people eighteen maybe 20 or public most
of them that you would see at Bourbon

71
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,620
Street look around number when you're
out there these guys tensely victims are

72
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:42,320
correct so what happens is it contacted
you so I hate working to pay you money

73
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,000
for going out partyin working to use
your social media you're going to the

74
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:59,070
bars were gonna pay you to party 21 a
two-part also the perfect are you need

75
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,880
to do is send us your bank and your pin
number that way we can direct deposit

76
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:19,760
money straight because I know that's a
bad idea that they pocket the salat we

77
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:34,040
get reports this week is happening and
predominately comes out of old nice rack

78
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:45,130
problem is that I don't like to get
ready in this house to put the central

79
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:54,090
bank card you're in this once you tell
someone that yes they become an

80
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,570
uncooperative and they're taking its
just like I did that money back right

81
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:07,980
now because sent someone your pin number
is a violation of your bank's your user

82
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:17,090
you owe them money is the way the
Campana work someone that uses that cart

83
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,190
they posit bogus checks can you get
someone in another part of the country

84
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,660
also finding out just a little loose
fitting banks ATMs ATMs ATM

85
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:34,610
money out back out all within 24 48 hour
period thanks

86
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,650
checks but you do all this money where
is our money last one I personally

87
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:48,630
worked on was about $7,000 in today and
the really important thing was her

88
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:55,450
parents it signed and so the bank when
parents yet she doesn't obviously have

89
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:12,270
money there's a kind of a secondary
victims but the second part of that is

90
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,980
that investigation

91
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:25,350
texting the sorts of patients so as an
investigator and saying no to meet

92
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:34,940
actually investigate this case and your
mom and your permission look inside this

93
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,210
room would be excited about it and
everything

94
00:15:41,430 --> 00:16:06,420
by one sign up for that very few things
at the third challenge so far as victims

95
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:14,189
by 10 and CSI and NCIS those labs

96
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,820
everywhere so we have a corporate or
business victims intellectual property

97
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,930
of insider especially

98
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:55,849
denial of service that one PCI card
industry are like happy days

99
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,860
image to your company to your corporate
training and it's not the one that you

100
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:10,069
walked in one day and said you know what
I'm require you is the person sitting

101
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:21,230
there for months thinking about thinking
about what I work work by the time

102
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,280
everything on your back at work

103
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:58,650
31 all incidents involved in my name's
drop cable median cost for crisis

104
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,700
services forensics

105
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:14,590
the guidance and other one earned
$10,000 they really big corporations are

106
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:25,409
by can't small medium wallet thank you
thats stop get small business say which

107
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,440
did you too small and this year three
hundred grant this year because of

108
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:41,610
insider is really really tough so we
have problems

109
00:18:43,370 --> 00:19:01,989
job yet in let's get it back up and
running as quickly as I understand that

110
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:19,070
is for us once it goes away even when we
do recover its custody court saying you

111
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:30,360
know i no evidence release a lot of
counties

112
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:41,899
considered insider grats civil matter
because it was on track so you just need

113
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:44,899
to fire them they don't have a job

114
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,779
money and they certainly are not gonna
have a hundred thousand dollars or

115
00:19:51,779 --> 00:20:28,299
target lost two hundred million dollars
not one year we work one where he lost

116
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:48,399
12,000 over the house and then why those
to this part luck with cycling credit

117
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:52,998
card number twelve thousand that ones

118
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:18,180
the company so from March lacquer that
time were considered armed and it we

119
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:26,320
don't know because the tests were
actually quite who also notified them

120
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:41,280
what did they do all the rights and the
stream so it could have come from any we

121
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,830
know that narrowed it down to business
no idea because again it went on for a

122
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,830
while longer that harder

123
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:12,450
saudis and you're so we all know

124
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:18,340
PCI or PCI compliant if your PCI
compliant they're not gonna charge back

125
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:27,340
he said they were to come in and say
you're an idiot you had WiFi in your

126
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,760
payment system you know it's your call

127
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:44,700
in that case we assume that they were
attacked by the time we got notified

128
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:58,080
that contacted them and they already had
people come out quite that lack of

129
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,149
timely reporting occasion I would say is
tension

130
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:08,770
people reach happened six months ago so
that 111 million user accounts they're

131
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,310
floating around in the dark

132
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:20,169
been out there six months because people
kept saying here sometimes

133
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:32,250
traded companies their stock 10 jobs to
maintain shareholder value that's all

134
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,740
they care about their not interested in
telling the world just lost

135
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:45,460
challenged members expressed lack of
personnel talking about our program just

136
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:53,940
in general lack of trained deal with
sideburns most everyone in this room

137
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,860
you're working tonight see you would not
want to go to work

138
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,310
entry level and long are you in New Year
intake someone that actually a skills

139
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:10,480
now it's that's why they went and did
this morning I wanna make it so it's a

140
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:20,320
real challenge to try and get assistance
center on your taxes either number seven

141
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:28,760
number 614 million residents say now
coming in at City or second only to

142
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:40,330
washington state's yes how many trained
investigators work in that metro or

143
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,330
cyber

144
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:56,720
not nearly enough little more than by
