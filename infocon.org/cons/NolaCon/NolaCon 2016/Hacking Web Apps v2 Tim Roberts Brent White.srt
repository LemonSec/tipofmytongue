1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,900
every gal that's it we're not everyone
my name is Brent can talk to you today

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,859
about hacking web apps security
consultant at solution area a little bit

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,289
about this talk is like that

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:54,530
over there later in every time I so if
you're interested in getting into input

5
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,950
sector or your programmer and wanna
learn how to make your stuff secure I'm

6
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,480
gonna show you what I do as a security
consultant here to typical assessment

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,450
basically from the kick off all the way
to report delivery for the trolls out

8
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,550
there just taken the information I get
me today doesn't automatically make you

9
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,690
happier it does take time and you have
to practice and learn what you're

10
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:25,280
actually doing when you click buttons so
there's a few things that have to happen

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,720
before the extent than actually starts
we haven't picked up call up to the

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,530
client we actually figure out okay when
does this happen what are the limits

13
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,020
denial service and scope it out of scope
what is the scope of what are the

14
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,800
websites that you're going to allow us
to attack if we happen to kill your

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,050
stuff while we're doing it

16
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:57,050
who leaked all and all that and give
that fund PO Box you something that I've

17
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,759
learned the hard way as a newer
consultant was didn't gather enough

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,330
evidence there is so so make sure that
you gather plenty of evidence as you're

19
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,849
going through because that report is
expected at the end of the assessment

20
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,019
and it's never a good thing when it's a
week

21
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,890
past the end a and you have to call a
nap or access again because you forgot

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:27,399
the screenshot something so evidence
gathering dust I'll tell you the tools

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,900
that I like to you know there are
several options out there but again

24
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,880
these are my personal preferences keep
note is my first choice it's available

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,010
in Cali Windows as well as the Mac OS
can basically put screenshots you can

26
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,340
script things inside of it when you're
done if the client wants all of your

27
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,440
wrong notes of everything you found you
can simply exported to HTML and just

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:02,079
send it right over to the very easy
here's a screenshot of how I like to do

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,220
my evidence gathering so for example if
you if you have several post that you're

30
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,800
looking at first thing once that's done
I'll make a page for each host and

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,070
vulnerabilities that way for all this
simply do it by Boehner ability and you

32
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,459
can see that I have

33
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,570
like the unsupported operating system
that's a dark red I would consider that

34
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,040
a credible and so on and that's just the
way for me to get a quick visual

35
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,150
reference where I met the assessment and
by the way if anyone has any questions

36
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,540
going to be decent amount of information
found here please let me know ask

37
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,150
questions also we do ask questions I
have a few things that I will throw you

38
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:57,660
so I guess that's a good thing they're
not enough evidence gathering so

39
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,190
whenever you are collecting evidence
you're going to be in the assessment you

40
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,820
want to make sure to document it what
you sent to the host and what was

41
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,340
received obviously so you want to make
your HDTV and the response for each

42
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,410
vulnerability that way when you deliver
the report they can actually replay that

43
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:25,480
bar ability there in the remediation so
yeah things in the unscheduled downtime

44
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,480
or issues so if you happen in October
its service and you let the client know

45
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,460
make sure you document that in the
report as well as in your notes changes

46
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,090
and test data so if you happen to be
working in a production environment and

47
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,830
you have to create new account to your
offering data make sure you let him know

48
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,039
had created this account if you don't
have the permissions to go back and

49
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,380
remove it yourself

50
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,750
those things that can make it easier for
the client and of course the whole

51
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,750
purpose is to make them happy so that
you can get the job again

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,320
so something else I I have not made this
mistake but I know others who have if

53
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,210
you find a really cool high or something
that's just stupid but you were able to

54
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,440
get she'll vote for something do not
post a picture of it online

55
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,000
get a lot of trouble trouble with no
disclosures and let you sanitize it or

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,420
something

57
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:30,130
first but just be really careful about
that says screenshots make sure that

58
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,070
whenever you are screened jotting
something you want to make sure that

59
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,690
you're focusing in on what's important
you don't want to do your entire screen

60
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,040
and then try to throw that in a report
because it's not going to be wonderful

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:49,580
for example here's a screenshot that I
got for pooled data bases were at a bank

62
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,560
and so it's good evidence however if I
were to take the screenshot and paste it

63
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,140
into a Word document printed out you're
not going to be able to tell when the

64
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:07,229
world is so one of their way is that I
tried to prove that where the the client

65
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:15,080
can actually read what I'm giving them
is you can see in the grey box where I

66
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,380
have the username

67
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,200
are highlighted that is the request that
was made and then I'll do something

68
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,539
similar with that response so I would
take just a small section of that data

69
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,190
base and put it in a similar format so
that they can read it much easier

70
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,590
many questions so far

71
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,270
taping so for example still like the
HTTP request in in the report will say

72
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:55,370
will call out seeking injection will
explain what's the injection is and then

73
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:01,690
we have a finding section that says we
discovered that this parameter them

74
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,180
properly sanitizing in but we put this
in here and it gave its this and then

75
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:24,690
under that that's where we will put that
request and response so that's something

76
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,820
else that go back so we'll say that user
name is vulnerable to steal injection of

77
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,150
for example so you also wanted the
password is the password perimeter

78
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,870
vulnerable as well what about login is
that we will make sure that your testing

79
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:50,110
every parameter that they'll within that
that application they will ask you ok so

80
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,449
well user name was was vulnerable what
about past or if you say I don't know it

81
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,740
thats that that's really stupid so make
sure you test everything

82
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,810
quite a few people ask me okay so how
much like how do you know what to look

83
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,470
at their so much what you know first
thing out would suggest is a methodology

84
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,010
to go by

85
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,950
has been great methodology for assessing
web applications and basically considers

86
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:30,289
a very bad that application to go check
now again this is just something to help

87
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,550
keep you on track make sure you're not
limiting yourself to only doing what's

88
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:41,089
in that that checklist for that
methodology for example at that list

89
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:47,080
everything but your methodology that
you've adapted leaves out like remote

90
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,630
file inclusion or something

91
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,030
make sure your testing for that just
don't limit yourself just use it as a

92
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:02,569
guideline so you start getting into more
the assessment type things that we've

93
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,630
talked about kickoff call it talked
about documentation and reporting a bit

94
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,260
so one of the things that that always
like to do when assessing an application

95
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:18,610
is I want to look and see what's out
there were anybody to go on danse on

96
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,640
google or any open source intelligence
what stands for so it's incredible the

97
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,750
amount of free information you can get
and an unauthenticated user on a nap or

98
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,970
poor

99
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,430
for any sort of specially larger like
fortune 500 fortune 100 companies

100
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,420
they're so big that they have such a
huge digital footprint it's crazy what

101
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:52,000
you can find out there it's very time
consuming but can pay off quite a bit it

102
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,720
again if they've been compromised before
or if someone uses the same credentials

103
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,990
for this application for another site
LinkedIn for example all the information

104
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,810
that's coming out with recently in
breach you know check those out or their

105
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,758
emails from a company that you're
assessing right now look at those

106
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:21,470
credentials and see if they're valid for
that that application so talking about

107
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:29,160
that there have been several assessments
that have done where I found developers

108
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,379
that have asked for help on development
forums and they actually put the actual

109
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:42,279
bad about the database schema and they
will allow some random person access to

110
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,629
the data base the person says oh yeah
give me an account login I can fix this

111
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:54,110
and it's ok cool and they will post that
and this is from three years prior and

112
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,259
no joke it's still active you find it in
the post so all it's been archived by

113
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,930
Google email archives yet find it and
they're fine and development boats and

114
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,809
it still works because they forgot to
disable that temporary the temporary

115
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,529
account they made for work

116
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,059
the person that said they would help
them and so yeah it's ridiculous

117
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,940
more on there are you tools that all
this name there are so many out there

118
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,630
but a few that I use on a regular basis

119
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,310
discovered by leaving heard an
incredible Tories updating it constantly

120
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,119
and then you have tools that helps
create web results for you like medical

121
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,730
affiliate there's even a recon in so
many different tools that are available

122
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:50,709
and I know all of those I think discover
you have to install separately I don't

123
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:55,599
think it's part of Cali rolling
distribution but it's very easy to

124
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:04,390
install and it doesn't require many
dependencies didn't have any questions

125
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:15,519
so far to calm down a bit so automated
scanning why do you run automated tool

126
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,070
you're supposed to be a hacker ok so and
I'm addressing this because every time

127
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,630
you get talks and we're ten people could
love it and then you always have the

128
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,649
warrant role that can always do
everything better and good for him right

129
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:33,630
so well just running an automated tool
doesn't make you a hacker but there are

130
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:42,079
so many things to look at and consulting
doing so many assessments that basically

131
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,339
we use this to help fund will hanging
fruit but we don't

132
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,649
just use that there are several steps
that we take beyond ottoman skating with

133
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:57,449
the show you but let's get this out
pretty quick view this apartment the

134
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:04,349
application so it's again it's a huge
time saver in something I do want to

135
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,120
point out is a vulnerability stand not
being treated as kind of a pet peeve of

136
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,050
mine as you have certain companies that
will go and so a pen test but all

137
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:23,870
they're doing is some automated security
scan and everyone I hope that you go

138
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,490
around repeating this all the time but
if you run into anyone that says a we're

139
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,490
gonna give you up in tests but it's
really just a bone scan

140
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:45,230
smack in the face affecting because they
have yeah okay so automated scanning

141
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:53,620
tools again there are so many out there
that are free such as well as that and

142
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,779
many more than a few new and in Cali
ruling that I haven't had a chance to

143
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:05,499
play around with yet but I like nuts
it's really get my terrible idea mask

144
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:11,670
and is also very good tool birds sweet
bro you're going to hear me mention that

145
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:17,699
a few times and you acted standing can
do manual testing in so many things with

146
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:22,819
it and another one that I used to that I
don't really hear people talk about its

147
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:23,689
Nick too

148
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,740
which comes installed in Cali just
checked for it does basic scanning for

149
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,500
default files default configurations
that CGI settings and so much more that

150
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,090
it's pretty quick tool and help you find
some easy and easy bar abilities really

151
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:52,990
quick so if you're assessing an
application that's built on a framework

152
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,050
congratulations you will have a pretty
easy assessment I feel like such as

153
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:07,599
WordPress her DreamLine Jubal Drupal and
Joomla and so on I love frameworks

154
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,570
because they're they're open source
development they have so many plugins

155
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,130
that people can make for them and a lot
of calm those plugins have pretty easy

156
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,010
bar abilities to exploit so you have
tools like WP scan

157
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:28,540
made specifically for scanning WordPress
sites and so this will give you tell you

158
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,209
hey this is outdated they have these
plugins at all and you can even

159
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:39,460
enumerate user names so right away you
have a list of every single user name

160
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:47,460
registered with that WordPress site that
you can begin brute forcing if it's not

161
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,900
if it's not some sort of framework and
you're getting a dead and you don't

162
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,449
really have much to go after you can use
their buster the directory buster and

163
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,840
basically this is it takes very large
dictionaries and it will do a brute

164
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,260
force to find any files or

165
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:15,960
or directories that might not be linked
to the application so begin any

166
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,930
questions about anything and I'll leave
some extra time at the end to your

167
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,910
questions and will continue at automated
scanning so few protests

168
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,890
whenever say if you are using something
like that said 40 officers app or

169
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,780
something don't just put the application
you are on there and hit go I mean can

170
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,949
but there's a chance that you're going
to miss something or you're going to get

171
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,230
something down and it could be bad you
always want to make sure that you're

172
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,340
going through and looking at setting
such as how many connections at a time

173
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,310
make sure that your not flooding the
hosts with too many connections you want

174
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:02,479
to check for you know how do they have a
function that they don't want you to

175
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,420
scan for example there's a contact form
is there gonna be some poor guy that

176
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,380
when he comes into his office the next
day he has 10,000 emails because your

177
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,079
automated scanners the contact form

178
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,948
2005 yeah he likes doing that so you
know check those things you make sure

179
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,740
make sure that you're going through and
actually setting those things in the

180
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:38,790
scare I had quite a few times I client
will have four or page that's custom and

181
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,550
when you look for something that's not
there instead of saying error or not

182
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,810
found it will be 200 ok

183
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:52,530
what the cuts to landing page and so on
automated scanners sees that every

184
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,940
single thing it throws that it's going
to come back and say hey and its agents

185
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,160
there and that's a nightmare for going
through and trying to clean up to find

186
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,240
what's actually legitimate so just two
quick tip you can usually go through

187
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,220
pretty quick and fined if they do have a
custom here pay cuts and 200 instead of

188
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,890
the 404 you tell the scanner that that
we are not having to go through and

189
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:25,240
clean up all this job I can process
something that I don't think I have a

190
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,740
slide for this but I want to tell you
whenever you're setting an application

191
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:36,090
and you are doing it as an authenticated
user always ask for two sets of

192
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,300
credentials as an admin level and then
two sets of credentials as a standard

193
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,800
you know that standard level user that
way if you walk out an admin account you

194
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,590
still have another one that you can get
back in with your not having to wake up

195
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:58,158
and two or three in the morning and get
him to unlock an account so always

196
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:00,960
verify false-positive doctor at stake

197
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,980
don't get the same everything that
scanner found is legitimate

198
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,650
cross-site scripting actually go and
replay that request and something like

199
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:15,799
Berkeley pro and see if it actually is
legitimate vulnerability so many times

200
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,240
no matter what

201
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,960
automated scanner using or how good it
is there will always be false positives

202
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,600
and then once you once you have
everything configured and you're ready

203
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:39,379
to let that run you know match that's so
funny it's really a minute so I'll book

204
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:47,960
ok so and and again I'm kind of walking
you through the things that I do as the

205
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,770
pen tester with an assessment so once I
found in the low-hanging fruit with the

206
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,510
automated standing

207
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,539
take that and then I begin picking it
apart manually so this that's kind of

208
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,879
how I have set the talk up that way to
go back and review these notes later

209
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,220
hopefully take the same process and help
you that way you're not jumping back and

210
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,899
forth may be forgetting some things go
again with the automated scanners are

211
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:20,149
things that are legitimate make sure
that you document those that way you can

212
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:24,379
show the client had this is what with
sin and that's what came this is what

213
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:31,299
came back and how I determine its
legitimate more durability and so don't

214
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:36,658
you stop there can you take them further
so if there's a sequel if it's shown

215
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:39,659
that that it's positive for single
injection

216
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,840
get some sort of a show or something
like that

217
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,029
take it further can you take it too far
that you actually get a show on that

218
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:55,090
that's the value that c-level executives
want to see

219
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,610
and and the guy that is having you come
in for that department they want that

220
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,510
stuff because they could be doing this
that that way they can get more budget

221
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,270
for their department so you wanna take
things as far as you can to show the

222
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:15,300
rules read and you know the real baller
ability that's there so that this guy

223
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,629
whose department can get the moneypak

224
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:28,260
fixes again but they're also there
alternatives and these are just

225
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:34,450
properties basically your request a
website that the browser it goes through

226
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,530
the proxy and everything that's going on
the background and then it's in an hour

227
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:46,940
to the internet so what you can do as
you're looking through like say you're

228
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,220
looking at login function with Burke
sweet bro you can take it and say ok

229
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,040
well I change this User ID be to another
user id be can now can I become that

230
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:05,320
user without password can I but as the
username for sequel injection or cross

231
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,470
site scripting so those are just all the
things you can start to look at

232
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:20,620
through proxies like first week there's
a tool and most of those birds which is

233
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,600
called fighter to basically give it to
your it starts scanning everything

234
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,919
that's all eat with them that
application and it gives you everything

235
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,430
that's available that it knows of
content discovery takes that step

236
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,510
further

237
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,730
where it starts to slaughter brute force
and look for known as director is

238
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,560
unknown file names that might not be
linked in the code that was found near

239
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,100
fiery so make sure you're running but
for those tools if you use but sweet bro

240
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,419
or even the pretense that the free
version of birth sweet I believe also

241
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,840
allows those tools to be used

242
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,970
against some free alternatives yeah
arrows which is the newer tool in Cali

243
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:15,770
Linux and then and I think there's so
many free ones out there so just check

244
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,760
them out in your way out

245
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:36,909
figure out which one works best for you
ok yeah you know I've used all of those

246
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:44,960
I like them I think one of the reasons
I'm more apt to get Scalia is just how

247
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,700
easy it is to find help

248
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,270
something crashes and i'm having
dependency issues or something for me

249
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,629
it's trying to do stuff so quick and get
three things it's easier to find help

250
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:03,570
forums generally for Cali weddings but I
know there are some other things like

251
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:11,580
that they're great but I usually for
work purposes

252
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:18,399
Cali yeah it's personal preference on
that really a question

253
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:35,360
heads up well I don't wanna know that
this is years but it's also got some

254
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:51,809
nyquil Mouse micro mouse pad the stuff
you interrupt me nafta questioning the

255
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,559
team

256
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:27,309
what's so one of the things to look at
the proxy

257
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:34,908
responses so whenever you send something
look back at what what's coming back so

258
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:40,400
is it running iOS is it running Apache
does that tell you what version is

259
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,490
installed a lot times it will if its
older birds and you can use search and

260
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,900
check and see what vulnerabilities are
out there so you can start going after

261
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,409
those vulnerabilities

262
00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:01,049
varney talk about Ranbir Singh which is
basically if it's if it's a username and

263
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,418
it's expecting I actually use a name
start throwing special characters that

264
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:10,279
come in things like that cross site
scripting and see how it responds to

265
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,289
that you know is it actually

266
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:22,129
those inputs are not a few things to
look for the many things to look for

267
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,350
cross-site scripting cross-site request
forgery especially if you're looking at

268
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,668
an application for bank or somewhere
where there are customer transactions

269
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:39,000
that some kind of things you really want
to focus on a single injection you say

270
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,770
that many times

271
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:46,029
LDAP injection as well command
injections for operating systems those

272
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:51,140
are all things are going to check out
local and remote file inclusion is one

273
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,750
of my favorite compromise more posts
because they allowed file inclusion

274
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:03,140
probably any other vulnerability out
there leading all the way up to shell as

275
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,690
check that out and you can you upload
web show can you use cross-site

276
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,950
scripting to bring something malicious
in that will help you

277
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:18,490
escalate your privileges and again if
you're unfamiliar with the terms and

278
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,400
importantly because so high level

279
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,850
there are so many pre videos and things
on do I hate to sound engineer but if

280
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:32,770
you're just getting into this make sure
that you you things you can teach

281
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:38,540
yourself so much for free so
unfortunately I can't go really add

282
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,909
depth with these things for this talk
one of the cool things that I really

283
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:51,610
like about bro is when you're going
through and you find it was there are

284
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:58,080
pre-loaded list for being at least equal
injection or cross site scripting you

285
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,919
can also move takes a few other guys
have some well-known lists out there

286
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,350
that you can download for free and you
can throw those in the air and that

287
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:15,209
parameter many times with many different
techniques and payloads to see very

288
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:24,020
quickly if it's going to handle anything
it should get against you know to expire

289
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:32,030
as anybody in here actually use the
united by our site scripting scanner I

290
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,930
know a couple years ago but I don't
really know it's hard to run across

291
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,950
people that actually use it I recommend
it it's a really cool cool and actually

292
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:50,540
runs three website engines in parallel
the same screen so I kinda like Chrome

293
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Firefox and Internet Explorer

294
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,340
the same payload at one it might not
cross site scripting but the other two

295
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,800
will so it's it's a really cool to see
based on what engineering get-go and

296
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,990
general whichever ones how they
interpret the Palins that you're sending

297
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,990
so that they don't think so

298
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,490
a really good cross site scripting tool
to validate that was longer abilities

299
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:28,750
and that's just quick screenshot
specifying parameters amber so you can

300
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,790
see that the parts that are highlighted
in orange those are the parameters you

301
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:39,030
can either do multiple or personally I
like to focus on one parameter at a time

302
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:45,570
so that I can know exactly what's
happening here as well and less for

303
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,700
whatever reason you're doing some sort
of the Hail Mary and you're just trying

304
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:55,240
to get anything back from it that UK in
which in my experience is never a good

305
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,840
thing to try anyway so I recommend
focusing on one parameter and time

306
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:10,790
that's kinda goes back to the reporting
that I was talking about earlier you

307
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:16,909
want to save all of the poster get
requests that you see in for the report

308
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:22,460
for things that you found
vulnerabilities or if you found

309
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,600
something he found a parameter that you
think might be vulnerable single

310
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:33,209
injection actually say that post the GET
request as secondary like a text file

311
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:39,950
and then run that text files or sequel
map or secret BBQ or some other sequined

312
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:45,910
directions tools that are installed in
Cali this will be very extensive and

313
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,640
exhaustive tests on each parameter and
it will usually get you pretty high

314
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,630
level of competence it is far more to
seek one direction

315
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:04,440
for injection cool thing about burt
sweet bro again I promise I won't work

316
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,360
for that company out of three like a
tool they have a really cool inclusion

317
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,709
that you can run for sequel map where
basically takes that request for you and

318
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,080
runs automatically and it's a view the
steps that that would create a secondary

319
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,629
file go to the command prompt and type
in the command to run it just seems a

320
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,570
few steps manual testing again

321
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:36,510
few things to look for that surprisingly
I gotta talk to a check for you the URL

322
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:43,490
is actually passing census information
websites that actually passed the

323
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:50,179
username and the password which is
usually poorly encrypted in the URL you

324
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:54,690
always want those to go through post
requests and said SessionID ease

325
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:00,210
anything that can be leveraged you don't
want that going through the URL you

326
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:09,260
wanted to be a POST request for comments
in code there have been a few sadly few

327
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:17,030
times where the developers have left the
database name the internal IP and a few

328
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,678
other really useful tips for me it will
not for me but for themselves in the

329
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,240
code all I had to do what's right click
and view source and then I had a few

330
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:34,790
extra help me along the way again that's
the man that manual process can be time

331
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:42,850
consuming but it pays off and then
usually a lot of that the the programs

332
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,040
like boats we will you can just right
click and save show comments

333
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,470
it'll go through and show you every
single comment every page that you

334
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,870
the proxy so it now

335
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:01,370
talking so much death by PowerPoint is a
very happy

336
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:12,799
information released are and it's not
really even more I love the way that I

337
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:54,250
can think of without it being a
completely useless as you're actually

338
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:59,720
wanted you to do this instead thats yeah
there have been issues like that in a

339
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,440
way to sort a hash that out from the
beginning during the kickoff call when

340
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,619
you're talking about stopping you just
have to be very clear and say it will

341
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:15,460
make sure like is this the URL and then
is there any way always ask are there

342
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,280
any special things you like for us to
focus on so that's one question we asked

343
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,840
it

344
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,560
had a static code review done we say
things stood out to you were there any

345
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,570
red flags that you want us to focus on
our code word here so just make sure you

346
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:40,130
ask specific questions up front to make
sure that there is little

347
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:45,710
misunderstanding as possible regarding
scope yet we have had that happen before

348
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,860
basically will say well this is what was
discussed and you know we will try and

349
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:59,610
make client happy time permitting but
we're kinda figured out how to prevent

350
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:04,720
that from happening so that's a good
question that's irritating issue that

351
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,359
comes out at the end

352
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:13,210
yeah 2012 leaks but yeah you didn't do
what we wanted to do so you know you

353
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,340
can't really he's expletives on the
phone and what you wanna lose the client

354
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:27,410
can see we've got something I can't
these things that we could try

355
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:40,750
guess he's ready i dont have happily ok
so back to manual testing authentication

356
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:47,460
obviously a very important part of the
application for their URLs are functions

357
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,630
that you found the state as you're
logged in as admin user and you have

358
00:35:53,630 --> 00:36:01,940
like application dot com slash admin for
it / update password . PHP something

359
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,610
along those lines can you still access
that as an unauthenticated or a non

360
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,350
admin user those are some privilege
escalation things that you wanna make

361
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,470
sure to look at

362
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,250
when you log off or something times out
can you go back and grab that session

363
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:26,180
cookie and replay it and now your login
again that's not a good thing as silly

364
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,950
as it sounds

365
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,819
is there a feature you'll be surprised
at the amount of people that actually

366
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,880
forget to put a button that says log
that actually terminates its so you want

367
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,369
to look for those things but it sounds
silly but you actually run into that

368
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,180
quite a bit

369
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:50,339
password requirements last week I was
assessing an application and I was able

370
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:57,660
to go through and change the password to
one is the single numeric or one that is

371
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:03,089
terrible I even have a pet store right
so you want to recommend I'd say

372
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:09,460
probably at least eight year requiring
uppercase lowercase number in special

373
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:15,090
care that's pretty standard right so if
they're not requiring that if it is

374
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:20,940
something terrible like a single one
call that out that's bad you could brute

375
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:28,930
force that pretty easy probably in less
than a second if you're if you're

376
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,609
wondering what can use to brute force
and like web a picture of something with

377
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:41,060
high drug is good you could also use
proxies like it is again saying that but

378
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,190
you can throw a pool password list you
can even better user name lists at it

379
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,520
and try and win

380
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,509
brute force those can you have multiple
sessions at the same user the same time

381
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,720
some people don't really consider that a
boner ability and it might not be if if

382
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,020
if you're just logging in to check
something something trivial when it's

383
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,190
not necessarily something important has
a bank account it might not be ivana

384
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,350
building but still check and let the
client now and this is informational

385
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:18,270
level but we were able to login as same
user at the same time with different

386
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,420
browsers now if it's a pain you could
see where that might be more important

387
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,280
because let's say you're logging into
your bank account you're checking

388
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,330
yourself and your your session expires
because of malicious user had your

389
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:38,779
credentials in a London well that kinda
gives the user flag ok why did I just

390
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,720
get locked out for a reason so that
kinda help you understand why that might

391
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:50,230
be more vulnerability depending on what
the web app is used for and then pastor

392
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,230
Cain process when you change your
password

393
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,750
best practice is to either have to login
again or to give your current path or if

394
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,790
they let a change your password without
requiring current password I would

395
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:10,400
report that because that's weak weak
sauce

396
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,560
look at that game and I talked about
this little bit you want to look at the

397
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,740
host not just the app so again if its
running an outdated version of Apache

398
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,700
and there is a denial of service
vulnerability or you know if it's

399
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,680
vulnerable to heart leader something
like that you want to check that out to

400
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,660
cause that might be a different way for
you to fully compromise that host any

401
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,270
don't even need the application again

402
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,540
admin portals I love it when I find an
Apache

403
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,009
and her open that's not locked down to
an IP

404
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:54,130
brute force and they don't lock you out
usually you can brute force now you've

405
00:39:54,130 --> 00:40:01,120
got access to their Apache war file and
now you have compromised the bus so

406
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,339
those are things to look for as well

407
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:11,940
directory browsing found sensitive
information director of housing usually

408
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:21,990
through some federal clients and other
fun when I don't get this very much but

409
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,339
when you do its ridiculous because it's
so easy

410
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:32,360
HTTP methods that enable are you tell it
and then you put your code and actually

411
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,500
put your shell on their hosts for you
and now he owned the box great and then

412
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,980
if delete is an able to delete it and
take care of it otherwise tell the

413
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,520
client to put this on the air

414
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,860
can't delete it you might want to take
care of it so your boxes and opened it

415
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:57,150
in as I mentioned a second ago hardly
shellshock directory traversal check for

416
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,310
those things and again in map for
everyone's heard are used in map at some

417
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:10,580
point if you're looking at is the only
port 80 and 443 that's open or do they

418
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,910
have it at Sage you know SMTP all in
other services that they don't need

419
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:20,120
those are things that you want to report
on if it's just a web server you only

420
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,460
want those web services open on that box

421
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:47,129
for example actually something highly
critical what we do is we'll put

422
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:53,880
together a report of that single long
durability immediately and we go ahead

423
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,109
and escalated to the client that lay
hopefully by the end of the assessment

424
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:03,540
they've had a chance to fix it and then
we can retest for them the whole point

425
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,140
is to help make them secure is not
necessary to make some guy go home and

426
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,040
cry cuz you told him his baby was ugly
you know because he thought he had a

427
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,130
great website but it was terrible but we
also want to help make it stronger too

428
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:21,010
so that's a good question so yeah if
it's critical

429
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:27,779
some people will escalate hot esli highs
Incredibles to stick with rebels so

430
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,369
personal preference I guess or whatever
the client asks

431
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:45,939
setting so if they have it they have SSL
to enable with very weak ciphers and its

432
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,810
website that accept credit cards are
paying that something you want to look

433
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:56,240
and Steve are they are they using
correct encryption you know supporting

434
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,490
correct ciphers or is it all are they
all weak ciphers with known

435
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:05,240
vulnerabilities SSL scan as mentioned
here that's usually my go-to

436
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:14,970
in Cali Qualys has a cool scanner to
online only caveat to that is its public

437
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,950
and they save your results so if it's
something that you're really worried

438
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:25,759
about third-party disclosure or anything
like that I would probably not use it

439
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,000
but if it's just a quick thing that you
don't really care they say the results

440
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,550
before

441
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:37,110
file uploading features as a just
mentioning

442
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,029
thanks for the giggles at my stupid
picks up probably laughing harder than

443
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:49,020
what I should so appreciate the giggles
so following features if there's a

444
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,820
FileUpload you know a lot of bank
websites are there things you can create

445
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,330
profile everybody likes to have a custom
profile with your own picture something

446
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:03,170
like that so they have to enable file
upload capability you'd actually upload

447
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:10,660
your picture is so if it accepts that .
JPEG PNG or something can you take a

448
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:18,620
custom shell that supposed to be got THP
in the a.m jpg to the end of it and it

449
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:26,950
accepts it sometimes yes so try vet did
you can you obfuscated can you take that

450
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:32,810
code and encode it in a way where web
application firewall or whatever method

451
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:39,470
might not pick up on it she wouldn't try
those things it's amazing how how easy

452
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:49,040
it is sometimes to simply upload a shell
upload function and as I was talking

453
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,279
about

454
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,090
evasion against antivirus ideas I ES and
wow

455
00:44:54,090 --> 00:45:00,240
federal more fun to say why but whatever
you want to obfuscate polymorphic code

456
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,069
anything you can change again any
changes

457
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,780
file extensions while wrapping anything
to trick the application to let you

458
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:15,190
throw something on there should be one
of the

459
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,619
it's things that I want to point out is
as you're learning this stuff you make

460
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:24,980
you want to know really know what's
going on behind the scenes so when you

461
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,099
put go when something what's happening
is if you not go over at service in the

462
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:35,450
client says what did you do and you say
I don't know yet click Start you know

463
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,319
that's never a good conversation so you
want to understand what's actually

464
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:44,329
happening with these tools that your
automated scanning automated testing and

465
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:48,630
things that way it's something does go
bad you can explain where you can just

466
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,950
simply understand to know when not to
use as attack methods set up your own

467
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:00,000
practice lab never learn this stuff on
the client side I've seen guys get into

468
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,490
some really deep water because they're
okay here's a hint or tried on my

469
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,020
assessment tomorrow

470
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:09,720
not a good idea practice in your lap and
then when you're ready to have some

471
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:17,169
websites so that's basically my talk I
guess it's time for questions please let

472
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,170
me know if you have any questions if not
you can see he afterwards

473
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:45,808
and what have you done so

474
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:52,309
methodology was really about methodology
is that those are good I get away from

475
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:56,679
me and a lot of the guys I don't know
that it's a good way is kinda make sure

476
00:46:56,679 --> 00:47:00,719
it is when you're doing you know three
or four assessments a month on three or

477
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,729
four different environments

478
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:08,448
it's it's gonna get mixed up for me
anyway gets mixed up gets cloudy so I

479
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:15,129
have a checklist that I've made through
spreadsheet and so for each section like

480
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:18,999
the open source intelligence you know
buzzing parameters it just kind of

481
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:24,519
broken down and I could go through and
just check each they got what and for me

482
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:29,129
that helps against that kind of personal
preference but I'd say probably to start

483
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:35,049
I would suggest that the methodology for
stars who else

484
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,179
alright thanks guys thanks for listening
and get questions
