1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,150
today right and are going to give a
speech part of espionage 2016 addition

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,800
the speech and topic that we've been
talking about cost twenty years I've

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,490
done this speech by title believe this
is year sixteen so what we try to do is

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,960
give you guys a basic primer on what you
need to do prevention and the kind of

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,039
like tricks and things that we can to
teach people on our day one so if you

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,130
were to get hired on to our team and
work with our our practice this is kind

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:34,019
of the basic stuff we'd run you through
that first day we kinda like doing this

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,160
more as a form type discussion with the
room so if you have questions during the

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,468
conference please feel free to or rather
presenting please feel free to raise

10
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:46,000
your hand and shout out you know it's we
rarely make it to the queue a section of

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,230
the slide deck especially in an hour
long format because I talk too damn much

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,968
and I he ends up telling stories so
alright so that all going to go down and

13
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,079
see who we are and say why we're
discussing this talk about the myths

14
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,030
fables and bullshit that exists in the
industry right now that keep getting in

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:09,470
the way we talk about how you can become
a spy and working in red team will talk

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,400
about how the changes over the last 10
years that we've observed in this

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,479
industry a kind of changed how we
approach our attacks and what we do

18
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,220
we'll talk about the actual process of
the attack itself which is the larger

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,630
media section of this where we stepped
through the individual kind of the the

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,130
life cycle we love how to conduct the
work and we'll talk about how to tell

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,220
the story of your client where they can
actually appreciate and understand the

22
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,780
assessment you've done to our way right
and I are best friends we've known each

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,760
other for twenty-plus years

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,400
we hang out and work together on and off
in various roles in various different

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,410
companies currently at this moment he's
my boss which kinda cool but we we've

26
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,289
been around and work together for a very
long time this industry as a collective

27
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,340
though were part of a larger 303
organization which I like to give credit

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,470
to the start of every one of my speeches
because I didn't belong to a larger

29
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,470
organization like 303 I would have had
the opportunity in time to learn a lot

30
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,810
of the stuff that I'm learning so what
about trying to do it on my own so I

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,940
want to credit everybody in that picture
her for their knowledge contribution the

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:17,359
years but we're discussing today we're
not going to talk about contesting

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,740
basics vulnerability assessments
incident response out case doesn't go

34
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,740
through and exploit moment you guys have
some of the best in the world

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,720
available this conference you can teach
you these things that's not what we're

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,330
here to do today here we're here to
discuss how to not suck espionage red

37
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,530
teaming some more importantly when will
I see you guys again mindset there to

38
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,520
get an idea of the mindset necessary
when performing regime testing which

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,820
part of that is staying fluid adapting
to change because no matter how many

40
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
plans you have that's not gonna happen

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,910
red teaming to define a conservative
bunch of different definitions

42
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,260
combination of physical social and
logical testing to make sure that things

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,399
are going to react the way to clients
expect them to win their action when

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,310
they're under an actual attack so the
idea of a network meant as a similar

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,769
meeting up in making sure that firewall
is the way most people more time I read

46
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,170
teaming we're combining fishing in and
lying to people in dressing up as UPS

47
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,690
guys and clock ticking and everything
else to make sure that all of all of the

48
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,920
assets they have in place to protect
against people like us will work we

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,299
expect to find the gaps and helping
mediate one of the biggest reasons we

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,090
want to include the slide is because
we've now for the last 34 years so the

51
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,450
new trend where people are starting to
use the term red team to describe

52
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,350
internal testing and were being part of
an internal security team that is not

53
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,410
the definition we're using today

54
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,430
running Nexus is not red teaming is a
very very small small small part of

55
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,360
retaining the Miss tables and bullshit
that we all deal with all of your in

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,330
this industry guys here this everyday
people sit there and say they're not a

57
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,740
target they have never been pwned that
hackers wanna put them out of business

58
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,320
next-generation security solutions gonna
fix blah blah blah all these different

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,380
things that you see on the screen but
shit and you guys know that because you

60
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,170
see it all the time you can deploy your
next generation signature-based solution

61
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,690
and it's not gonna stop us single bit of
a day you can sit there and you can tell

62
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,230
me that hackers wanna put you out of
business naughty all day long you're a

63
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,219
liar because hackers if they compromise
you want nothing more than access to

64
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,600
your data bandwidth everything else out
of business would be the opposite of

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,000
what they're trying to accomplish truth
is though that you really need to keep

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,490
in mind as we do this talking as we go
through this because a lot of what we're

67
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,570
introducing in teaching you guys
intentionally low-tech basic stuff is

68
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,090
that if a motivated to hack motivated
Tiger wants to get in there gonna get in

69
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:50,750
so you know again going back to the idea
of why it's physical logical and not

70
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,680
just one or the other

71
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,620
all these areas whether it's financed
with its hospitals whether it's a small

72
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,410
mom-and-pop shops it's about protecting
the data data doesn't just rely on the

73
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,710
internet doesn't just resign on a
computer printout fundraiser resides in

74
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,700
people desperate resides all over the
place in the plane's protect the data

75
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,159
credit card numbers on the health
information whatever it is that is vital

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,390
to that company's operations she want to
be a spy we love this because when we

77
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,919
talk to people who aren't in the
industry they listen to what we do we'll

78
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,320
show them sanitized deliverables are
sanitized videos that we can share

79
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,349
that's part of our speeches and things
like that and they're always like you

80
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,950
guys like a real world spice it's like
you guys are sneakers for real on the

81
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,500
truth matters both Ryan I love that
movie and when we were younger that was

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,680
one of the movies that helped kind of
influence our direction of where we went

83
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,270
professionally with our work was that we
we saw a lot of people in this industry

84
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,830
that we're out there to check a box
search to run a tester to get the thumbs

85
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,469
up they've done something good

86
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,920
but we didn't see was application of
attacks that were very real world based

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,530
meaning that if somebody was actually
going to target UN come in and an attack

88
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,500
your business they're not gonna sit down
with your sexy c-level executives at her

89
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,860
own room table and ask you questions
about things they're actually going to

90
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,590
attack your business so the first big
step we gotta do in order to be able to

91
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,489
do that is get smart as as all of you
know this this job requires you to be a

92
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,700
jack of all trades you can't just be
good a pen testing you can't just be

93
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,090
good at fuzzing you can't just be good
at lock picking you have to do a little

94
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,440
of all of that to be able to apply that
put it together to be successful this

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,110
work

96
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,790
one of the big things that we've started
doing is pushing people towards looking

97
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,720
at the industry developed and supported
standers so you've got HIPAA

98
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,570
sarbanes-oxley you have ISO 27001 02
you've got all these different PCI

99
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,540
requirements exist around credit card
processing now so you as an attacker

100
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,120
need to start looking at the different
industries and verticals of your clients

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,340
because that's the kind of thing that in
the end when you're delivering the

102
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,909
report you're talking to them about what
you did that's the stuff that's going to

103
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,090
make it matter to them they don't give a
shit how cool you are and how quickly

104
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,409
picked through that lock they care that
on the other side of that lock was a

105
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,060
datacenter hold of their PCI environment
and their PC I didn't you could have

106
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,430
gotten every single credit card
transaction simply by being able to pick

107
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,350
that nor you have to be able to type
that stuff together when you tell your

108
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,850
story and when you wanna get educated in
these are good things are good learning

109
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,479
spots but at the same time don't rule
anything out so beaches like this will

110
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,419
teach you some hopefully but there's
books that are that have nothing to do

111
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,719
with red teaming because there's very
little out there on regimen actually but

112
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,790
example one of the books I just picked
up is called the burglars guided the

113
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,850
city it's written by an architect it's
an amazing book talks about how burglars

114
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,680
have to actually used the architecture
building to break into it gives you a

115
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,270
different way of thinking it makes you
start seeing things a little different

116
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,549
that's the kind of stuff you wanna start
reading more

117
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,940
junior conferences your social
communities near hacks basis again just

118
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,300
like I said at the start of this slide
deck I i thought i was cool shit chillin

119
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,400
starting now 303 and it made me realize
how long

120
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,150
credibly quickly I was in New because
there's just no matter how good you get

121
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,580
something there's always going to be
somebody better and if you have an

122
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,390
opportunity to come together with those
people and learn and share knowledge and

123
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,760
information what a great way to learn
and get better yourself or drink a lot

124
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,250
we end up doing a lot of other great
source of Education obviously security

125
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,220
to.net has is kind of the YouTube of
security videos out there like to give

126
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,080
him a thumbs-up because they've put a
lot of work and effort into making not

127
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,370
data available for all of you

128
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,070
offensive security Metasploit unleashed
is a great great primer for people to

129
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,170
start with that they've never done
contesting her ever played with the

130
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,190
basic tools that is offered via
Metasploit and then obviously da condo

131
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,460
rogues a great one to Jeff Moss is made
it to where all speeches have been

132
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,970
recorded and published so you got 24
years of slide content speeches of the

133
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,200
best in the world city of you talking
about what it is that they do so please

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,060
take advantage of these free resources
and we end with getting certified which

135
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,189
kinda you know everybody in the industry
certifications whatever its peace paper

136
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,300
but the truth of the matter is when
you're going in front of Fortune 100

137
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,030
clients largest banks in the world and
you're trying to demonstrate to them the

138
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,470
value that you can do the work that you
can you can conduct for them it's

139
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,600
important to have those letters behind
your name because those letters do mean

140
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,840
something to the executives the AHR
people the people that are gonna be

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,970
responsible for hiring you so as much as
as a group we can also hearing kinda go

142
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,390
on paper that's actually good technical

143
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,569
choosing the rest of ya it's important
to make sure that that you got it near

144
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,190
where the spending time and resources do
this if you're wanting to do it

145
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,850
professionally so long the same lines
giving skilled so

146
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,490
people like digging and they did not
easy thing to do with blocking is

147
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,300
practice that's all it takes you don't
have a 200 piece by pick set the ought

148
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,079
to have crazy mother videos it's
literally just buying lots more hardware

149
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,489
store and is practicing over and over
again same thing with the NLP stuff for

150
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,399
the social engineering stuff it's
getting used to his being comfortable

151
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,759
its practice your practice social
engineering going to a bar gonna be

152
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:08,000
somebody you're not going and and get in
that might start getting yourself in the

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,910
minds of that person who goes to be
specified a practice

154
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,610
loves those tough to the survival
training is a bit much mister go right

155
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,180
over here staying staying healthy is not
a bad idea cuz when you're not healthy

156
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,329
start doing especially some of the more
physical aspects of the stuff you're

157
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:27,019
gonna fall and hurt yourself

158
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,790
military law enforcement training I put
up here mainly a lot of people can

159
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,490
discover that but the cool thing is that
if you join the right mail lists and get

160
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,579
on the right Facebook pages in this kind
of thing you'll find a lot of this

161
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:40,500
training is freely available for anybody
that signs up you don't actually have to

162
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,740
be a badged Ali were a mill officer in
order to take this training and and

163
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,310
paying attention to stuff like that got
it to where I was able to watch Frank

164
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,540
Abagnale talk about the work that he had
done before joining the FBI a few years

165
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,240
back simply because I was on the right
mail list at the right time so it's a

166
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,600
double take advantage of it

167
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,490
challenges duck pond games obviously we
have the challenges here there's ETFs

168
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,819
here that you guys to participate in
tools here you've got a great

169
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:06,899
opportunity to be able to learn how long
before if you are gonna lock picking you

170
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,670
got an opportunity to be able to compete
person time opportunity to the people

171
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,759
that wins the urban exploring climbing
rappelling you can skip the being Batman

172
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,610
part no one has that much money but the
urban exploring it could be quasi legal

173
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,370
depending on where you're going there
did you start thinking about things

174
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,689
along this virtually abandoned building
to start making it look at things seeing

175
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,269
ways into a

176
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,000
and paying more attention to your
surroundings and in game to play home

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,839
games complete home so I put that in
there out of that because I i do things

178
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,750
I do challenges of my kids like my boys
are now 17 and 15 years old that since

179
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,550
they were 56 years old

180
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,510
age you know I've done the basic stuff
like teaching lockpicking and you know

181
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,330
evasion and getting around things single
boot mode in Lenox all the cute little

182
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,519
parlor tricks that we all know news but
one of the things that really been

183
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,200
beneficial of my children and not just
with this type of work but in their

184
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,890
overall life is helping them get
situational awareness so we play games

185
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,209
were all walk into a room or they're
playing video games not be like hey guys

186
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,439
and I'll make them turn around and look
at me and I'll talk to me about

187
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,740
something and then I'll change stuff in
the room and I'll come back in five ten

188
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,190
minutes later and I'll be like when I
change and you'll watch the kids cuz

189
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,690
everytime I go when I changed since they
say that they go because they know they

190
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,839
have to look up pay attention really pay
attention

191
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,320
look at what has been modified in their
surrounding be able to pick it out when

192
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,180
I first started playing with this this
game with my kids and their 56 years old

193
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,810
it was horrible

194
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,209
they can never ever pick it out they
could never ever see what was going on

195
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,300
now that they're teenagers and they get
a little older it's frightening because

196
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,149
I make even like tiny little changes
like turning something that sitting on a

197
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,920
shelf and they'll pick it up and notice
it because they've program themselves to

198
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,089
constantly be aware of their
surroundings in their environment by

199
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,399
designing some of my daughter will go
into russia or something I'll change

200
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,760
rooms will go to a different cell maker
sketch out the last room like where the

201
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:09,020
laws where the source she hates it but
as a good job of making sure that the

202
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,020
biggest point here is to make sure that
we're talking to a company and position

203
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,869
ask the right questions to make sure
that you're going in the right position

204
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,180
and then the position that you're
thinking of going into

205
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,760
is what you're looking for companies
like to describe things in certain ways

206
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,180
and then kind of shift you need
something else you want to make sure

207
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,290
that for example if you think you're
going into the red teamed up to make

208
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,579
sure that they have a methodology
documentation template see you there

209
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,870
have a team or not just the only person
that suddenly doing this neighbor never

210
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,600
sold it

211
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,250
may have happened a couple of times
bigger than what we see is that people

212
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,949
want to get into this work they think
it's interesting they go to the great

213
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,420
and then they go and they get an entry
or the princess level light penetration

214
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,670
testing drop and get pissed because they
spend ten years learning how to hack

215
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,149
local networks and never ever once to
any bit of red tape the big thing that

216
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,930
we find that really kind of pushes that
are the safety figures as we like to

217
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,630
call it where you've got these companies
that love to put titles and descriptions

218
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,160
about what the work is but it's actually
not what they're doing are conducting I

219
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,560
can't tell you the number of times that
we've talked companies that you

220
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,540
penetration testing and all the newer
motor village assessments or companies

221
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,170
that say they're doing red teaming and
an internal development threat programs

222
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,819
and they do a very basic contest make
maybe some dogs are used to work for IBM

223
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:33,139
years ago and they would say we do you
do physical penetration testing when he

224
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:41,459
was water and they reject Lions
occasionally and idyllic do this again

225
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,369
and then legally get a hold on it

226
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,790
not know we don't do that thats rich and
liability so it's it's tricky questions

227
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,839
make sure you know what you're getting
at

228
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,720
remembers you do this job is the time
equals change when talk about this

229
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,790
little bit as we go through this but a
good way to look at his I took this

230
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,209
picture in 2006 for the same speech

231
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,349
these were the tools of the trade you
can see that I've got a radio I've got

232
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,279
an old PCMCIA wireless Orinoco cards up
there for cracking WEP all this great

233
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,620
stuff right and at the time that I took
this picture this was literally cutting

234
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,610
edge talk the tool Dr the type of stuff
that we are using has an entire RFID

235
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,649
cloning

236
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,250
actually this newest last a long time

237
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,930
still have that backpack but nowadays
when you look at what's going on

238
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,849
everything can fit in your pocket I mean
this is a pretty standard setup here

239
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,690
I've got a pump at all the individual
tools are very very small collection of

240
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,850
pics you can see there just like ron was
saying my previous slide deck you're

241
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,660
looking at you know $300 worth of pics
and all this crazy vision stuff I've

242
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,089
broken it down to a southern ordinance
kit that's just all I ever really need

243
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,220
one of the biggest things that you'll
hear from us as we go through this is

244
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,780
it's really easy when you first start
doing this work to just 12 pack like

245
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,089
five or six backpacks full of every
single be security and then you realize

246
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,990
when you go to the work that really all
you needed was a strong shoulder and

247
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,510
credit card right through the door so
the key is really make your make your

248
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,380
way count think about what it is you're
bringing why you're bringing it how

249
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,320
you're going to use it with the
likelihood is that you're going to use

250
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,540
it and how screwed you'd be if you
didn't have it that's really the big

251
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,459
thing that makes a decision no matter
how much more stuff you carry the more

252
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,500
you have to dig through it

253
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:33,820
find the right thing you looking for I'm
trying to get over this for a minute so

254
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:40,630
eight years ago wow we get that TV show

255
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:48,180
Tiger Team last two episodes of this
episode we had to break into a jewelry

256
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,589
store in Beverly Hills what we're doing
right now as we couldn't leave his way

257
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:58,410
to bypass the front door was going to
clone the guys I RFID card and a friend

258
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,839
of ours at bill this RFID cloning kit
which that's literally one of the first

259
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,010
in the world there was massive and heavy
and shit in that backpack and then you

260
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,319
have a cable that snaked down your arm
that upon the reader and you get really

261
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,399
close like almost grabbed the guy's ass
which and that's what they show is Luke

262
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,130
revenue guys asked why I always make
sure that you know you know you'll see

263
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:34,150
it in a couple of size but like RFID
cleaners now i think is bad we walk off

264
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,980
there's a lot of talk going on here but
the big thing to take away from this is

265
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,890
that when we did this testing and I
talked about this a little bit when we

266
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,710
did this testing before really there was
a handful about three or four people in

267
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,860
the world that we're looking into how
widely technologies were producing

268
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,330
equipment we're doing the work as a
cranking out amore those guys were

269
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,689
really killed it with our affiliate I
think it was called back but they were

270
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,690
really doing some research and work
they're presented on a blackout on it

271
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,110
and it kind of got us interested that
unit that's my backpack was put together

272
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:09,928
by dulcis another 30 three year and it
took him five months of testing in plane

273
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:15,850
to get to where he could capture card
and replay a single card using Adam and

274
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,280
acts like researched it to be able to
put that together for us and build it

275
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,600
and if you noticed a huge took an entire
backpack it was super hot as the other

276
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,030
thing that was interesting is to
generate enough enough current for us to

277
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:37,020
be able to use those readers like it was
three or four lantern batteries like

278
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,850
linked together in parallel and then
like going through voltage regulator

279
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,219
just to have enough charge to walk out
on the street from the batch walk back

280
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,520
to the car and pray to God the battery
connection to disconnect somewhere in

281
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,269
between we woulda lost everything

282
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:56,289
together the best thing to look at is we
can only capture one card at I'm at best

283
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,969
it was impossible

284
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:01,659
realistically to rewrite your own cards
that point most of us if we were doing

285
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:04,649
card rewrites all we're actually doing
was calling the company that produced

286
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:06,988
the cards and saying hey this is our
site

287
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:10,979
idea and we also need these card numbers
from this point to this point and we

288
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:14,409
would do these orders of hundreds of
dollars that would be overnight shift

289
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:20,419
where are all these little cards just be
able to hack 1 RFID card RFID card sorry

290
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:26,139
replay attacks were very reliable with
portable year at the time but now with

291
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:30,928
it being 2016 obviously we've got the
process mark three hits in your little

292
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:37,829
tablet I modified the tablet and I'm
using testing the testing software

293
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:42,668
that's inside for playing with your box
marked be able to log every single

294
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,889
region out makes it to where one carry
this little reader that's about this big

295
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:51,049
I can literally locked thousands of
cards as I walk through an area if the

296
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,329
battery dies it doesn't matter

297
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:55,469
already logged off I'll go back home
into the night I can sit there and write

298
00:19:55,469 --> 00:20:00,119
these out to the various to discard the
right to the other things taking

299
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,639
consideration that handheld RFID writer
on there we all looked at it we've seen

300
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:08,889
it I've actually seen one work in real
life everybody looks at him and China

301
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:13,629
for $9 but I've actually watched one
work on an engagement and even cooler as

302
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,629
the Blue Key as he sat down there in the
lower corner what once was a backpack

303
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:21,259
full of beer for us to be able to
hopefully be able to do something is now

304
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,599
something the size of a quarter of the
you can place inside of an RFID reader

305
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,450
in the news your phone to be able to
trigger it to replay people's

306
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,589
connections as they come back through
pretty neat stuff the other way to look

307
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:37,509
at it is that backpack full of your was
almost $2,000 worth of research and work

308
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,259
put together

309
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,779
proxmire or the parts Mark 30 along with
tone pad set up that I've got theirs by

310
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:46,229
$1,000 worth of hardware to do it right

311
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:51,049
handheld RFID reader was 10 bucks I
think and the Blue Key

312
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:57,679
like 25 bucks or something if you get a
few Bible cover but it really just kind

313
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,409
of goes to show that it's one of the
things you need to think about his as

314
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,749
you're doing this work and as as things
at camps so we're going to be the

315
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:07,700
attacks or gonna be your approaches all
that stuff is is going to get different

316
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,969
and and you have to modify your approach
throughout the years so did the general

317
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,649
we love attack

318
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:25,049
prepared and ice ice a charge your phone
because your phone at this point is

319
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,879
pretty much the lifeline of a test you
have to communicate with the team

320
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,570
members have to collect evidence may not
always be allowed to walk out the door

321
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,239
with people working computers and shit
yet to take pictures videos etc to prove

322
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:42,479
what you were able to do your own due to
phone because we're talking on it when

323
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:47,619
you're pretending to talk on it and it
actually rings people notice and it's

324
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:52,339
loud it's been especially don't don't
charge your phone have a backup battery

325
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:56,989
too I just was on and get her last week
where my coworker is sitting under a

326
00:21:56,989 --> 00:22:04,139
desperate four and a half hours and so
he couldn't text me that the lady inside

327
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:08,389
the office had noticed me even move my
car in a parking lot so that wasn't the

328
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:12,758
same spot she had noticed me and called
the police and he wanna sex me but his

329
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:19,069
phone died so he couldn't tell me the
police showed up that actively don't

330
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:23,499
look at part of the reason that you
don't see us using the big big antennas

331
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:26,690
and ham radios anymore and why we sit
here and tell you to use your cell phone

332
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,589
looks out of place you don't wanna walk
in looking like you're a spy looking

333
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:35,039
like your bed looking whatever it is you
want to blend in

334
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,649
but you need to be thinking and acting
tactically will you do this work

335
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,299
one of the biggest things that I watch
new people make a mistake with doing is

336
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,359
dole walk into a rumor an area that they
don't belong in that they should have

337
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,260
been in someone's there they do the
worst in the world

338
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,290
they pause they look scared they turn in
a walkout versus just walking in and

339
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,700
owning the the room

340
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,730
owning the area keeping it simple so
this is something when you're doing red

341
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,260
teaming this is not a threat clients it
shouldn't be a one-time thing should be

342
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,050
something that's never happened every
year every other year is the ideas you

343
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,810
start really low keep the lowest of the
low tech as if you start off RFID

344
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:19,350
cloning and going crazy and super
high-tech specially client has never

345
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,100
done this before and they're gonna read
it freaked out and not know where to

346
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,389
start fixing shit on the shelf and never
talk to you again if you start with

347
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,890
simple things hard shaming you may be
some lockpicking social engineering

348
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,080
tailgating is still a huge problem

349
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,030
start with a simple shit let them have
time to fix that given recommendations

350
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,470
on the simple things start off cheap for
them is usually cheap fixes for that

351
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,940
then they'll come back the next year you
made it more difficult yourself that

352
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,140
makes it more fun for us to know I want
to keep doing the same shit every year I

353
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,420
want to get to the point where
eventually you are like you're

354
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,580
stretching really having reached for how
the hell you to get in this building or

355
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,550
how they're using the flag to the point
where you can give a report and maybe

356
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,379
you got the flag but you can also tell
my clit based on your company based in

357
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,080
the threats that exist for your company

358
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,980
no one's going to ever really do this if
they do here's how to detect it because

359
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,530
you can't stop and remember number for
your the criminal this is your job like

360
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,120
your job is to replicate a real-world
attack criminals do not walk in I said

361
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,820
this earlier but criminals do not walk
in and sit down at a large desk and do a

362
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,000
system of checks and balances to make
sure that you've got a firewall

363
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,370
installed they're gonna walk into your
front door and they're going to pick the

364
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,610
easiest targets of opportunity and
that's what they're going to attempt to

365
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,350
exploit and steel but started
information gathering this is mainly

366
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,020
online you go through it we've got you
know Google Maps and movers and

367
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,100
LexisNexis social media is also a huge
every company has social media presence

368
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,879
as you want to know what they're bad
looks like to look through Flickr look

369
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,220
to the

370
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,610
Facebook account you'll see a picture
someone wearing a badge duplicated

371
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,908
exactly you make it look close enough
that when someone classes at it they see

372
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:10,679
the green panel with the black waters
one of the other things do is check out

373
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,350
the website of the company that you're
hiking going back into looking at the

374
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,340
pictures like he's talking about various
company events it'll tell you what kind

375
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,649
of dress they have what kind of clothing
they where you know are there a lot of

376
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,940
people that have big beard and Mohawk
sit at the place that you're walking

377
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,750
into or is it all really clean cut
people that look like they just walked

378
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,610
out of church those are things for you
to know your everyday on-site clients

379
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:40,500
wherever reason love to brag about who
they used for using Cisco Dell or go to

380
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,770
a true story by Adele sure and you're
there right in the front so when we

381
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,668
started this work and started doing this
work 1996 1998 timeframe we didn't have

382
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:54,030
all these online auctions we actually
had to go to do like you'd go to county

383
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,120
records and public service searches need
these types of things but sometimes be

384
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,699
able to pull data and information about
about these businesses now with Hoover's

385
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,690
LexisNexis Google Maps you can literally
with Google Street View can walk around

386
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:12,789
the facility over and over again before
you ever even there any liability on

387
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:16,570
site recon same kind of thing you know
we've all seen the pictures and videos

388
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,320
of people sitting out in the car and
done it for 10 to 12 hours where you sit

389
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,639
there with a little piece of paper
recording what's going on

390
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,970
modern times now guys there's no reason
to do that you can put a drone out and

391
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,090
you fly a grown up above the business
you imply a drone near the business

392
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,879
these things are fairly silent anymore

393
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,840
get the right ones makes it really easy
click the whole bunch of information

394
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,250
very very quickly without having to
reveal your identity or location I don't

395
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,370
know if you guys can really appreciate
it but the middle picture that I have

396
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,039
there is a glass window that someone is
a whole bunch their notes and passwords

397
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,539
and other types of things on make sure
that you have a clean desk clean board

398
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,809
policy people laugh at me about this
when I say this but I cannot tell you

399
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:58,649
the number of times that we've gone to
businesses and they don't realize that

400
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,919
just because they can see out during the
daytime and not seeing when the standout

401
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,110
smoking a cigarette doesn't mean that
that's the way it is it might if flights

402
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,729
are left on and you're sitting

403
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,280
a mile away and you've got one of his
camera lenses that he just bought for

404
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,620
this job you can literally take
high-resolution images the glass

405
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,149
multiple floors up of what people have
on the boards it's a great way to get

406
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:25,360
access to different things inside the
business the other thing is we still a

407
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,120
lot of dumpster diving again you guys
watch the Tiger Team thing you saw

408
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,168
examples in real-time bus like going
through bloody tampons and god knows

409
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:40,260
what else just food given this world's
done now days we have secure Benz that

410
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,990
everybody supposed to put their
documents into the cool thing is you can

411
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,710
usually open them with a flat head
screwdriver because the stupid hinges on

412
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,809
them they can have a nice big fat lock
on the front hinge on the back to

413
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:54,780
literally just pulled out looked up the
other way and use the longest the hinge

414
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,879
but the cool thing about those sensitive
document Benz is that you're guaranteed

415
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,530
to be getting gold because no one would
take the time to walk away from their

416
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:09,610
desk and thrown in there it wasn't
something critical and important target

417
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,320
selection obviously got some pictures
there these are things that we looked at

418
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,070
the only real one that I want to call
out here is that lower one with the

419
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,490
brick wall a lot of people ask me why
that pitchers in there you know

420
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,320
obviously got one here tailgating shown
examples where renews alarms to stop

421
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,879
like elevators to get on the course that
the the one on the lower part they're

422
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,520
the reason I showed that is that the
building architecture itself actually

423
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,379
provided me with the series of stairs
that I was able to use to get up to the

424
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,850
second floor where none of the windows
word they'd only thought about actually

425
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,309
locking in securing if you look at the
window that's right below there until

426
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:44,200
it's like nasty hardened lockdown window
all the ones that are above it on like

427
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:51,190
the second and third story just
literally go up so when you're talking

428
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,720
to a client began the project you need
to stop black whether that's a deal

429
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,809
whether it's the building for 30 minutes
of you could be anything but they're

430
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:09,510
still it can't be just as you break in i
mean that's fine but they're doing it

431
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,179
professionally cuz you still actually
opted to buy buy a scope what is the

432
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,160
client said that you can and cannot do

433
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,640
and it's really important to make sure
that you clearly defined that before you

434
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,160
start breaking into their especially if
they've never done before because they

435
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,050
might think this really cool but they
don't really understand what put

436
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,530
contracts are used against them to make
sure your conversation among casual

437
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,410
usually do no rule in or rule out what
you can and can't do and that's fine you

438
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:38,470
have to you know last week was a bank
they ruled out lock picking and the use

439
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:44,110
of specialized tools which kinda limited
so I used a pizza and a coat hanger in

440
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,290
the middle of water broke in big thing
to think about to us when you're doing

441
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,340
this professionally how much time you
out unlike criminal you can spend months

442
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,230
maybe even years I'm planning to do a
large coordinated to talk when you do

443
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,760
this professionally are usually given
somewhere between five to 10 days to

444
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,740
actually executing do the work you have
to work very very quickly and I will not

445
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,260
sure how did it all for you if you come
and work with us or any of the other

446
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,210
teams that really special in this type
of thing you will not have a two hour

447
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:17,520
workdays days holds 16 to 20 hours when
you're doing this work and and that is

448
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,570
just for you to have enough time to get
everything done that you need to get at

449
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,750
the same time you're really into it
you're not going to want to sleep and

450
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,220
even when you try to offset weak we can
do this and you can leave the hotel in

451
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,590
just gonna try to meet when discussing
the flag and the important things with

452
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,070
the client really talk to them about
what's critical for their business to

453
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,439
operate who gives a shit if you steal a
whole bunch of credit card information

454
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,230
if it turns out that it's all being
processed by a third-party processor

455
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,550
never ever want such as their
environment but they may be very very

456
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,540
interested about the fact that you just
don't two hundred and twenty people they

457
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,649
charge data about their medical records
about social security numbers home

458
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,460
addresses phone numbers that stuff means
more and that's really the key is why

459
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,900
you're talking to your client you're
trying to kind of scope the South

460
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,900
understand what's most important to them

461
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,629
planning will get into this little bit
more but the big thing to look at here

462
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,549
is that I i put this crowd in with
priestly because the big deal I've done

463
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:18,400
assessments with various people out
there I give a lot of respect to the

464
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,270
different people I work with but I've
met some people who are really hardcore

465
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,100
in this industry that have to plan a
plan B Plan C plan D plan and it becomes

466
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,799
this huge massive pre-planning when the
truth of the matter is you just have to

467
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,520
be able to be flexible so noticed the
stiffest tree is most easily cracked

468
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,520
while the bamboo for the willow survived
by bending in the wind really made that

469
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,150
quote it's absolutely true in a way that
we approach this look at it almost from

470
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,900
a martial arts standpoint of your
wanting to be able to see the threat

471
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,840
that's coming out you wanna be able to
react as quickly as possible approaches

472
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:57,909
and stuff will come out in europe online
training you're not talking tom cruise

473
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:03,950
once I hope his one-time got actually
repeal of the building to get into it

474
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:10,320
one time in 20 years of the work
planning and preparation so my favorite

475
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,049
thrift stores you'll probably find all
sorts of their employees that have left

476
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:22,690
a given to them are now or the crime
themselves gave to him when they were

477
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,740
trying to be nice and they changed the
new logo that is again with a Bachelor

478
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,700
play with a business cards of all these
things

479
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,190
if you can collect online before and you
can start making all this plan again be

480
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,990
waiting for you go on site for now
business cards easley no doubt bad as

481
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:46,630
ginkgo ginkgo is your friends everywhere
has a Kinkos and they're open 24 hours

482
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,960
planning the attack so when you do
you're actually on site were doing the

483
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,789
vulnerability insight analysis thing you
need to be thinking about is how are you

484
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,879
gonna get in without being seen wearing
a deal with the various security

485
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,240
controls it exists and and how are you
going to locate what it is that you're

486
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,549
looking for when the most interesting
things will bite you in the ass on your

487
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,850
first day doing this job is you broke
into the building you're in the facility

488
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,740
now now what if you don't never for plan
if you don't know where the data centers

489
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,649
out if you don't know where the
administrative offices are at your just

490
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:21,549
wandering in the dark and that shows in
back with that there has been flagged as

491
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:25,190
there is no flag you even know where to
start the first line of getting without

492
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,539
being seen that might be worth looking i
differ I don't care if I'm seen if I

493
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:36,129
already got away trade you a video tapes
of me doing something that maybe I'll

494
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,130
just do the videotape that's happened in
the past so execution when you go get

495
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,240
ready to do the attack you gone in you
gather your information you have a good

496
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,630
idea who these people are the different
types out there in place you need to

497
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,590
prepare yourself for that work part of
that his mental condition in which will

498
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,799
talk about the next slide but the other
aspects are you need to make sure that

499
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,149
you're aware of real threats that exist
how you're going to get what you need to

500
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:01,158
get in when you get in how to not get
caught

501
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,460
how to maintain persistence once you've
left and how to get out cleanly the big

502
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,639
key rule that we teach everybody is
don't fuck it up so states of awareness

503
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,280
I used to call this the the stop for the
stop sign

504
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,980
slide but the truth of the matter is
that I stole this from the United States

505
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,418
Military they train this mental
conditioning all soldiers go through

506
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,029
this training all law enforcement
training in more the aspect is that all

507
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,079
of us who live in life you see in this
room right now you're probably in a

508
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,659
condition green where you're comfortable
you're unaware of various threats that

509
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,569
exist outside of this room most people
live their life like this when you work

510
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:39,550
in law enforcement military or start
doing operational type work like this

511
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,470
you'll train yourself to continually
existence in the condition of yellow

512
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:46,549
you want to have that heightened
awareness you want to be attentive you

513
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,970
won't understand what's going on you
wanna be aware of the conversations that

514
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:53,029
happen around you it takes a bit of work
to get your brain train for this stock

515
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,609
something just clicked on all the big he
is that you don't necessarily want to

516
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,940
live in red red is after something has
already happened it's reactionary you

517
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,590
looked panicked you look stressed if
you're doing this work those are all

518
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,650
very very negative things the other
thing is really making sure that you

519
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:16,760
know the true threats that exist for
years we've we've SAT here and you know

520
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,410
models sister plug years we've warned
Kevlar vests when doing certain

521
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,759
engagements like airports large banks in
places like that because we're going up

522
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,430
against running costs that have real
guns and real bullets and we don't they

523
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,520
have no clue that were coming they see
us as a real-world threat which is

524
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,440
technically in my opinion the only way
to conduct this type of work in

525
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,540
assessment and have it be real is is for
the people who were responsible for the

526
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,830
security not be aware that you're coming
in doing this work but the big he is

527
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,310
also make sure that you got your get out
of jail free card printed on your phone

528
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,940
and on you physically to where you can
reach your back pocket and pulled out a

529
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,490
piece of paper that shows that you are
authorized to be conducted in doing the

530
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,680
work now that doesn't have to be a crazy
legal document that literally just has

531
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,690
to say with the date and time and a
signature of the the client her firmly

532
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,830
on the client letterhead saying you bear
this letter is doing this kind testing

533
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,660
here's what's involved here is the sites
that are involved with the dates that

534
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,109
are if you're in question of these of
the visibility of his top of this letter

535
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:24,440
call these numbers and it should be at
least three people at two o'clock in the

536
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:32,359
morning when you have to use that is not
get caught if you show your get out of

537
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,310
jail free card you you've lost

538
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:41,609
don't run catches you know it's a bad
idea they don't like that and honestly

539
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:47,609
when I and this is happening the past a
guard or drawn on you don't reach your

540
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:51,430
pocket for the letter just tell them
where it is a dude apparently giving bad

541
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,200
advice because if you look at breaking
in

542
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,060
on the TV show like three of those
people are hanging from court right

543
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:03,210
there so I mean I guess we did wrong
guys but we did include you a nice

544
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,190
little slider me looking like I'm giving
Chris Dickerson head and say for Tiger

545
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:15,599
Team ok physical ways of getting in our
favorite physical ways to get us in and

546
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,609
it worked over and over again in the
past is getting to invite you and guys I

547
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:22,598
mean it's cool to go sneak in and do all
that but that shouldn't be your first up

548
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,859
your first step should be reaching out
to building management building

549
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:28,450
maintenance talking to them about
various ways that you can get in it's

550
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,609
amazing when especially on these big
shared property facilities if you call

551
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:35,020
up and just be like hey you have offices
open we would like to look at your

552
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,020
offices were looking to open up a
location in your area

553
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,170
know literally walking in the best part
is the person is walking UN and showing

554
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,349
your out of the building their RFID card
opens every door and they're not

555
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,040
security people so they're not going to
think it's weird when you pull out your

556
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,279
little phone pad set up with rocks part
3 inside of it and you go oh that's

557
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,240
really cool back and then hand it back
to them they have no idea that you just

558
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,919
imagine doing that

559
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:11,180
utility companies one orion's favorites
bucks players and you can spray air I

560
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:18,230
got five bucks we're going to a
datacenter and IT guy come here and like

561
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:24,780
not at school I got this is like it's
it's special quick drying my watch it

562
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,780
has spread from that might see you can
tell it's wet

563
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:36,410
public bathrooms and and public reaching
areas are a wonderful just lift list if

564
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:41,790
it has a false ceiling ceiling tiles
left it almost always you can use that

565
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,230
to get access to secure areas of the
building where to actually find places

566
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,060
that have designed a building with the
intent of a data center or secure server

567
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:57,020
like I can't tell you the number of
times even like they just like this is

568
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,910
our safe room and you go over new push
up all four directions into other safer

569
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,060
miss you literally just crawl over from
somebody else's office into their room

570
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,590
why take the time to pick lock you can
call over it the biggest the big point

571
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,860
of all of this is you want to present
yourself as if you belong and be

572
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,230
friendly you don't have to be an asshole

573
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,630
it's not if people talk about how you
can be a cruel and social enjoying your

574
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,530
not gonna get very far with that nine
times out of ten shutdown smile

575
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,150
importing goes along way guys on side of
incentive we talk about candy contest

576
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,850
and pizza Eric Smith all use this
example one of our friends gentleman who

577
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,890
works with lawyers consulting him
another consultant went up to the places

578
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,180
they were hiking and they'd already done
the job they'd already got everything

579
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,899
but they want to see how they can really
push it on their last day they walked

580
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,890
into this facility took a folding table
set it up in the lobby of the business

581
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,900
not shared property this is like the
lobby of the blah blah blah business

582
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,940
they're tracking and they put up a
little sign that says come test the

583
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,420
strength of your password and they were
giving out free candy bars all these

584
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,260
people that are typing into an
application their password to test the

585
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,830
complexity of their password the crazy
thing was over seventy percent of the

586
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,880
people that walked up and actually typed
in their password gave them a legitimate

587
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:18,500
domain credentials for the business that
they were in it you'd be amazed people

588
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:24,030
are stupid guys other fun things to look
out obviously RFID we've already talked

589
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,990
about credit card trick still works
that's that's super hardcore badass lock

590
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,479
right there by the way that's that's
probably the lock them sitting there

591
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,470
shaming is probably almost a $200
installation on that

592
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:40,740
door for that that panel and that lock
and yet I got into the room key cards

593
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:50,160
gift cards are free and they're perfect
don't use your idea don't you and if you

594
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,160
do use your idea you're gonna get
questions every time you should it's not

595
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,660
hard to figure out what happens your
idea when there's very little Denson and

596
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:04,480
done it once and other fun stuff is if
you can see how on the third picture

597
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,840
there the gates exposed meaning that I
can usually get a tool in there to do

598
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,710
the credit card trick so if you're
installing a responsible for security

599
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,720
need to walk around your business and
think about the shit magnetic locks are

600
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,790
one of my favorites because I've got to
do is walk up there with a little bit of

601
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:23,160
iron filings and rub it across the top
of that magnetic bar any kind of a break

602
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,098
that you create even at my level between
the magnet and the bar itself makes it

603
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:37,560
or if you put your foot on some of those
bars or the like

604
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,509
take six thousand pounds of force to
open this door know until you put a

605
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,410
piece of duct tape on the reason I
included the one on the bottom on the

606
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,690
middle it's one of our favorite tricks
we carry a ziploc bag with the sponge

607
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:53,070
with liquid tide on it you can wipe down
a key pattern aqui cerca stays cool

608
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,890
thing is after people coming in touch it

609
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:59,509
the residue of the oils on their fingers
in their fingers touching it will

610
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,200
definitely affect cool thing about
liquid tide is looking tired how is full

611
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,700
photo passports so we hit with the black
light glows bright so you can see where

612
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,390
it's damned those of the buttons that
people have been touching are using my

613
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,900
favorite on this one is that key there
is a ridiculous and would be super hard

614
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,050
to pick that lock but it was awesome
because the janitor who I was talking to

615
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,260
as I told him I was taking pictures to
change all the locks for their security

616
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,730
he added me the key so I can take a
picture of it go home and come by on

617
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:33,060
other types of things that exist in our
little shittier power supplies for

618
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,779
datacenters lot of states require that
you can't lock these by law to walk up

619
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,180
shut off the power to the building is
the biggest thickest move you can do

620
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,920
great way to tell me that you're testing
their UPS's but you'd also be amazed at

621
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,390
the fact that because of loss of life
being the leader in how this stuff is

622
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,270
done when you kill power to the building
security controls like electronic

623
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:03,079
magnetic locks that they'll open by law
it makes a lot of noise rebuilding you

624
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:10,900
hearing like freaking out as they walk
outside to smoke cigarettes one more

625
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,910
great way to be able to RFID badges
offer people what a better way to put

626
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,410
300 potential matches out in front of a
business then shut off the power to the

627
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,930
business or triggered the fire alarm we
all know the tricks with motion sensors

628
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,339
like I showed up there in the middle

629
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:27,828
we've talked about the hot water under
the door the can of compressed air all

630
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,829
those things still work

631
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:33,460
show down here on one of the door
magnetic sensors that you can literally

632
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,829
peel back the cabling and bridge the two
and then it never ever knows that

633
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:41,460
connection has been modified or broke
alligator clips actually helped alot

634
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,230
with this and in the middle when you've
got time you got to glass doors shutting

635
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,530
this way means that you've got a
potential be able to go in with the tool

636
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,140
and it crashed car from the other side
my favorite thing to do with that is

637
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,190
just a strap aluminum pulled in and
that's where the bank last week

638
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:02,089
problem with that that's where the
manila folder in the coat hanger went

639
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:04,390
right through and triggered the exit
sensor in the door

640
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:09,890
members of can't break in like it's it's
unreal how many different security

641
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,790
controls are put in place the just
really have no purpose I I love the one

642
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,529
down there it's hard to see in this
picture but the one with the grass

643
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:22,839
there's just people driving away a drop
or alright breaking India technology

644
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:29,119
using technology again we're not going
to sit here and talk about one billion

645
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,160
justification testing but you guys have
the idea there what we're talking about

646
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,299
you get little keyloggers that you can
physically walk in and put in line with

647
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,220
small little cameras are easy to plant
place and they do a really good job of

648
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,868
being able to give you access to see
what these people are sleeping in to

649
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:45,829
keep out other types of things like that

650
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:50,059
I gotta give props certain that is or
ever now they have been the single

651
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:54,940
largest source credentials out there on
the internet so when you're doing your

652
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,900
initial reconnaissance you say for
example find out that they're using

653
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,989
wireless cameras and you can see those
cameras that's the best way to find out

654
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:05,239
where the inside the building looks like
without having to go in the door and

655
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:09,680
those camera systems are almost always
installed with Deepak credentials stung

656
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,969
by a third party and the people who are
using it inside the business never take

657
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:16,400
the time to go back and hardness
credentials when you get when you get

658
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,719
your official work and you've got your
told them that were searching for things

659
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:24,869
like cameras were bad name the kid no
Mames computers bad camera whenever

660
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:29,150
again if you can if you can use external
resources going on

661
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,950
take advantage of it that's part of the
whole blending social I got to love your

662
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:41,538
camera system then I got into the
building are countered or candles as I

663
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:45,349
just literally walked my guy and i cant
seem on the cameras so I said ok take a

664
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:49,690
left and then opened that door for him
and he went to the next time I called

665
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,469
the elevator down to 172 the 15th floor
open a couple of doors for me was

666
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:57,449
exactly what I needed to be all because
they click the link in an email the

667
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:00,420
other thing is don't ever underestimate
the power of stupidity bring your own

668
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,390
disaster is now everywhere even hardened
military facilities now even though

669
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,788
there's policies against it you will
always find some jackass standing there

670
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:14,640
with a smartphone that has Bluetooth
enabled wireless enabled there's a

671
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,269
million different tools out there that
you can use to me in the middle of this

672
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:20,249
and take control those devices which
they then carry into their secure

673
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:26,558
facilities other devices obviously lots
of other stuff here that we can hack and

674
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,180
things that we can look at pagers pac's
a complex series of Unicode foreigners

675
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,379
nowadays a lot of printers have you know
64 gig worth of memory it's an awesome

676
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,859
place to be able to store your tools and
be able to have a dumping ground to put

677
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:45,140
data to Excel traded out convenient have
made things really easy we have coffee

678
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,049
machine smart TVs smart gorgeous nasty
all these things now they can all be hot

679
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:53,630
all this stuff has been publicly
exploited pushed out there

680
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,029
smart TVs those things are in conference
rooms all the plays they have webcams

681
00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:02,210
and microphones you can just let the big
key to remember all this technology

682
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:06,309
stuff is don't spend a lot of time
resources and energy trying to look cool

683
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:09,490
when you can just pwned people people
are stupid

684
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:14,640
the key is that we have an uphill battle
to fight because like I said people are

685
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,368
really really stupid and they do dumb
shit so they can even know that what

686
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,700
they're doing is the wrong thing and
they'll still do it on like a fish

687
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,450
unlike a technical control to review
program and not to do something it's not

688
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,490
going to do it

689
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,189
people don't function outweigh the crazy
thing is is that what ten years ago we

690
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,750
are having to build a strict servers
with boy band we're doing all this crazy

691
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,140
work to be able to do caller ID spoofing
and just to be able to get through

692
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,828
nowadays you can download spoof app on
any smartphone and pay what is five

693
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:48,440
bucks 400 minutes or something like that
for credits and in my opinion it works

694
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,519
better than the ostrich servers and
other stuff too because it's on your

695
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:55,750
phone you have it there you don't have
to have external access to that server

696
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,650
it it makes it really really solid
social engineering toolkit once again

697
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,589
props out to the guy's a defensive
computing but this is a great tool set

698
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:08,349
that freely available for everybody
download use this along with like three

699
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:18,019
or four other software packages for its
not into guys doing good work in the

700
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:24,508
keynote tomorrow but the key is you can
walk in and just ask for it back in the

701
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:27,559
day are are the thing that everybody
would talk about was walking around with

702
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,900
the clipboard and tend to look
professional looking portal well I argue

703
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,769
against that because that draws
attention to you and it makes it look

704
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:39,288
like somebody who if someone is
responsible for the business of the

705
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:41,839
operation are gonna come talk to you
again asking why you're walking around

706
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,670
taking notes the amazing thing is that
if you walk into a business during an

707
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,279
iPod and and your plan on your iPad into
your thing no one is going to stop you

708
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:53,690
were asked what you're doing the cool
thing is that the iPad or whatever it is

709
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,279
you're a million different hacking tools
on it where the piece of paper does

710
00:48:57,279 --> 00:49:00,410
nothing more than brought attention to
you so again I show that between the

711
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,078
differences

712
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,819
ten years ago but he was saying the best
way to go and was look at thirty of them

713
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:05,240
say now the best way to go in

714
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,029
it's going to look like anybody else we
talk about a minute ago

715
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,820
make sure you make sure you wear
clothing to match them don't have

716
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,980
touched you showing if you can hide your
tattoos wear long sleeve shirt or make

717
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:27,510
sure they're now take your piercings out
their hair to normal color you're gonna

718
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,800
have to give up some things

719
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,950
job and when you when you're not doing
the job then you can have lived here

720
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,339
take the time to study again and all P

721
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,320
the stuff has been research for a long
time lot of people call the city's

722
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,619
science I can tell you find serious
science yet I have used it to hawk

723
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:48,790
countless people over 20 years time if
you learn how to read people's eyes

724
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,790
their emotions

725
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:53,860
attentive in your main close attention
to what they're doing it makes it really

726
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,880
easy to get them to buy into to what it
is that you're doing and what it is that

727
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,080
you're trying to accomplish

728
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:05,069
don't give you everything you want the
eye when I spoke with my wife she helped

729
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:10,940
me with it at a conference in Oslo
called paranoia earlier this year and we

730
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,300
walked in and she is a five and a half
foot tall girl with a foot tall

731
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,650
milwaukee has ball probably matters runs
Mohawk on it but we have her in this

732
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:27,170
really nice velvet dress and the best
part was during the first part of the

733
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,040
conference before we gave our keynote
she was walking around in that nice

734
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,790
dress talking all these people
collecting business cards getting

735
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:33,900
information

736
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,490
RFID sweeping people it was great the
best part was I go up and start giving

737
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:42,580
the presentation on stage I wait to call
her out to about this point me in the

738
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:47,150
slide deck that we were giving and she
walks out on stage with the red dress on

739
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,940
looking like the matrix girl in this
shot here and you watch half the

740
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,930
audience go cuz they realized as they
were flirting with this large breasted

741
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:00,509
tattooed punk look and check the entire
time she'd been harvesting in stealing

742
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:03,420
their credentials in their information
and getting information about their

743
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,500
business never underestimate the power
of being able to be cute smiling

744
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,180
flirting that stuff goes a long way make
people feel good about themselves when

745
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,720
you're packing them it's a lot more
successful than telling them that the

746
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,919
wrong or stupid

747
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,350
not getting caught so make sure you know
where your eggs are make sure you know

748
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:33,868
we talked about this for systems alright
so you're in the building access so

749
00:51:33,869 --> 00:51:39,070
things like three kids to the USB thumb
drives the leave behind which we use

750
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:44,550
Arduino Zuhr home close all the time no
one notices a little white box that has

751
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,320
a cellular modem minute has plugged into
their network and then called back here

752
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,010
server home so you can do everything
else from from the hotel room or house

753
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,990
physical access once you if you can get
in there during the day when you're not

754
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:03,220
breaking and entering putting tape over
a door latch putting you know having

755
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,040
seized as you see them girls Destrehan
idea and those are things that are all

756
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,600
really useful the next night we're
trying to do and people for whatever

757
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,750
reason don't notice that shit missing
you don't notice that the door doesn't

758
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:21,340
really close properly because you taped
up magnet taped up the latch that would

759
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:26,130
normally allowed or stay closed big
thing though is when you're getting out

760
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:29,000
when you're actually inside that
building it's now time to leave the big

761
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,210
you need to think about keeping call you
need to look you you've got a backpack

762
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:38,930
full of their since the most sensitive
information you've got everything that

763
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,230
you need now it's time to get out the
key is to not look like you're in a rush

764
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:46,760
to get out or to not look like you
belong again so we get a couple t like

765
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,830
little teasers here but the funny thing
is every one of these thoughts on the

766
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:54,920
slide is something that we've learned
the hard way over the years you'll

767
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,480
notice that some of the things in here
like the don't hang out or things that

768
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,600
others beaches will tell you is
absolutely a good thing to do so you can

769
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,259
develop a rapport with people but the
point is is that once you got the

770
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,310
the kingdom get the hell out of Dodge
there's no reason to stick around and

771
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:14,220
taught other cool things like this slide
because right and I over the years of

772
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,980
taking a lot of pride in finding common
household items like it at Home Depot

773
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:22,390
that you can use to help you with the
work remains you like if you're breaking

774
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,080
into an office facility simply having
one of those stupid little rubber

775
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,680
stoppers corridor is priceless because
you can kick it into if you break into

776
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,580
an office in like a large complex of
businesses you break into an office you

777
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,860
can put that door stop in place and then
even if someone has a key they're not

778
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,420
gonna be able to open it up to come in
to look at the key to remember about

779
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:47,400
this stuff is remove it when you go to
his you can't leave stuff messed up the

780
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,180
little drainpipe cameras that you can
buy now there are about 50 bucks I think

781
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,810
for the ones that you like smartphone
now those are awesome looking under

782
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:59,040
doors always a good idea to have an idea
of what's on the other side of the door

783
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,220
before you walk through it if you're
doing this for you don't want to just

784
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,649
all the sudden walk into the middle of
you know central security when you're

785
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,300
trying to break into their place and the
reason I included the headset even

786
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,800
though you'll never ever see me wearing
a headset at work when I'm at work is

787
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,180
the filters white light is very bright
splashes you can see for miles and miles

788
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,640
away if you defuse it using a red or
green light it makes it very very

789
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,580
difficult for people's eyes to pick up
the differences in the separation so if

790
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,180
you're inside of an office near going
back and forth with with like a red or

791
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,279
green light it's not gonna show outside
of that officer outside of the windows

792
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,620
like you would with a Maglite

793
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:40,690
so once you're done and you're out and
and the projects finished part of the

794
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:46,880
client actually peace the report it
needs to have a narrative explaining

795
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,010
exactly what happened and not just how
about us you are and they are good at to

796
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:59,670
look at what failed and what would work
best when its tests not just to make

797
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,780
them feel it also should work to make
sure yet documentation on both sides of

798
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,670
that makes you know how their employees
don't necessarily name people in their

799
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,590
clients I try to avoid that

800
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:20,660
especially when it's when the person
acting is that they're supposed to mean

801
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,230
that personal make sure they understand
whatever you did whatever trainings

802
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:29,800
person got that work so write review
repeat that person himself helped teach

803
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,220
the rest the company in the ways that
they respond right away

804
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:40,060
2016 get away from delivering static
reports it's important to be able to

805
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,880
have something that people can sit
around a boardroom and be able to look

806
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,690
at it through and read but include video
presentation of the work that you're

807
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:51,720
doing i mean a GoPro silver 04 is so
small now days that if you have it on

808
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,270
your backpack and it's so common no
one's gonna ever ask why you're wearing

809
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:59,320
a camera and the cool thing is you can
literally record days in a video if you

810
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,510
have enough memory on those things and
and the right batteries and the client

811
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,570
will end up using that shown up their
bodies and becomes a sales tool of you

812
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:13,710
know you had because they're going to
look we did this is that ass examined it

813
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:19,580
was I was on the job and I took video of
the exploit process that I was doing

814
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,360
what I was going through and we got
through and I'm sitting there talking

815
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,420
about how how things are done and I'm
like yeah with our poisoning we are able

816
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,080
to secure man in the middle of a
captured your boy profit you know and we

817
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,580
were able to listen phone calls that
tune executive meant nothing when I hit

818
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:36,200
play on my computer and played back
aboard administrative call from that

819
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,520
business and he listened to 4 minutes
and 20 seconds of his of his more

820
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,730
talking about highly sensitive
information and data all the sudden

821
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:47,800
attack I did which two seconds ago it
meant nothing to him was super super

822
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,130
critical and key and he wanted to figure
out how to mitigate that issue

823
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:55,670
immediately contact us there's our
information

824
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:11,279
and we got all the way through the slide
deck but the questions comments stories

825
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,340
to tell

826
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:27,710
thank you very much so I thought I'd
like to thank you very much you guys

827
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,030
thanks
