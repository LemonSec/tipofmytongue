1
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:38,110
across the great thanks for sharing I
first heard on a plus for everybody at

2
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:49,200
putting a lookout on what a great
environment to New Orleans and have a

3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,170
great time and all that good stuff so
actually the bed fairly early yesterday

4
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,280
for most folks think I think it's almost
everybody out still 1 a.m. so I feel

5
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,990
pretty refreshed and ready to go

6
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,509
little better myself ted kennedy I
started to companies called trusted

7
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,090
second binary defense just a second is a
consulting company like it's tough and

8
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,540
PDS is a mississippi but you know my
history is always been more so on the

9
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,380
technical side of things and getting
into organizations in more of the

10
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,450
offensive and so I thought today I talk
a little about what I do from an

11
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,170
offensive perspective but also talked a
lot about how you can detect things that

12
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,750
I do on a regular basis in all actually
releasing some new stuff on github W

13
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,670
today or Monday that there's a lot of
new techniques you can do to detect a

14
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,339
lot of something I'm doing but in other
news a lot of testify before Congress I

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,180
was a marine always funny going on the
news I think some of you have probably

16
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,510
seen me on there a couple times and you
haven't but when you go on the news the

17
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,399
first time ever did it I was terrified

18
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
you know you you're in front of the
screen and you can't see anything and

19
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,370
literally just sitting there and I have
no idea we're going to talk about you

20
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,430
you studying I had a little book the
first time I was gonna go on the news

21
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,290
you have a different points on the cover
and had like a five second you know

22
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,320
peace on the news or whatever and so I
started doing more moral I got more and

23
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,079
more confident what I was doing and
there is a time recently routes on how

24
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,090
supposed to be talking about like you
know like I said capabilities when it

25
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,540
comes to think it was the dude from team
poison trick that was you know you are

26
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,290
helping you know the ice and I get stuff

27
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,730
and so I knew my topic very well and I
was on different news organization will

28
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:30,988
say which one but they introduced me as
an Iranian nuclear experts know nothing

29
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,939
about Iranian nuclear technology and
their nuclear at all or even earlier was

30
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,780
going on I ran actually don't follow or
watch the news at all which is an

31
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,090
interesting piece so you know at that
point in time you know went from being

32
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,209
extremely comfortable 20 shit I need to
figure something out here and you have a

33
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,340
choice either you like ok can I ES my
way out of this or can I just tell them

34
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,459
that they got the wrong person who
introduced me to the wrong person and i

35
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,030
said i do the BSD I'm like yeah you know
the iranians is crazy but I stress out

36
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,810
from like in town I'm you know they pay
you know we talking about here for

37
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,370
mister going to like some Treaty of like
the 1947 something another in like I

38
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,599
have no idea what's going on I started
sweating in places I never knew it gets

39
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,488
wet from like you know I'm studying my
nose mightier than I live in a new title

40
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,858
is apparently the thing so you get crazy
situations when you gon those bears also

41
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,150
another one that I asked me how I would
disrupt Isis with an EMP and I know

42
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,099
nothing about the MP's at all you know
why would I want an epi says I have no

43
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:31,630
idea but still get weird things on on
those but it's always fun and exciting

44
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,440
thing on those type of things mostly in
the founders of Derby Conn so hopefully

45
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,630
I'll see you there

46
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,860
sorry about the craziness on ticket
sales that was unexpected I also wrote

47
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,979
the social engineering toolkit

48
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:49,500
things so today's talk is on offense and
defense and one of the biggest things

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,260
that I typically Stephen going it's
organizations is the fact that that they

50
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,949
don't understand how we attack from it
from an offensive perspective we goin

51
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,780
time and time again it's like everything
that we do is kind of miss nicole and

52
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,179
and it looks like you know magic from a
line a lot of cases in folks in the blue

53
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,590
team are very attuned to the
technologies that they leverage and

54
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,039
leverages technology is very well but a
lot of cases do not understand the

55
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,270
techniques that we leverage to get
access to the system and I'll talk about

56
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,740
that and some good stuff around the
detective capabilities

57
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,919
this is by far the number one most
common thing I see is not understanding

58
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,859
thoughts of attacks you look at actual
breaches

59
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,639
based on our company data but we done
for responses 82% still and point

60
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,509
compromise so you know going after the
end users 14% of prisoner compromise and

61
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,949
4 percent of employers so you know
shared credentials are things that they

62
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,539
did by mistake

63
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,030
know what's interesting about this is
that if you look at at risk highest risk

64
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,188
in organizations are gonna be by
compromising then user by far the

65
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:51,819
easiest way highest return a high return
on investment type of situation and so

66
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,659
we have a lot of security now Earl of
lack of security and M points and that's

67
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,370
one of our major areas of compromise
most likely about that but why we're

68
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,569
seeing this is the interesting part in
wire were at a point where one user can

69
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,289
be our entire downfall entire
organization still tends to be the case

70
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,139
and has been for a long period of time
and i want to show a little history of

71
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,400
InfoSec of why were at where we're at
today I think it's important to

72
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,279
understand you know we're at and why
were there today and then from there how

73
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,180
to be building a better at what we're
doing and if you look at the nineties

74
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,539
which is when I kind of came up I was
programming modes and games and stuff

75
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,650
like that when I was a kid but you look
at the recommendations of what we're

76
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,870
supposed to do you know your firewall
which are relatively new concept in like

77
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,469
hey these parallels and what you should
do is you should do never segmentation

78
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,839
you should like taking things off so
that people can communicate with one

79
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,900
another there was a good concert in the
nineties the nineties ok you should not

80
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,469
you know put sales folks on the same
thing is I T nineteen you know you know

81
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,690
something changes the issue should
actually segment off things and you know

82
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,110
create little containers of your
business that if you get to know they

83
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,449
don't spread over but no one really
listen to that and so we have fled

84
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,650
networks and all this other stuff kinda
happening right today and it seemed like

85
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,419
reduce crime will call and that's not
going to happen or we can just building

86
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,389
a network it's it's easier for us to
manage you know flat network then

87
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,490
actually have to go in and do know
segmentation

88
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,319
PCI happened right and everybody's ago
he will have to comply to PCI bus

89
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,279
companies that have to deal with PCR
using PCR framework you know when you go

90
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,009
to a board directors like hey we have to
do a PCR we have to you know do PCI

91
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,219
compliance to tell us do all these
things like using credit cards

92
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:29,219
nobody's going to comply to make sure
we're doing everything fine and so PCI

93
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:32,870
was a leveraged for us to start to build
security programs

94
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,960
because we were you know hey if you
don't do PCR were gonna get breached and

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,210
against my crying wolf and then target
happen and everybody started you know

96
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,120
saying hey let's not be the next target
right how many times we hear that I mean

97
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,810
board of directors to be hearsay that
type of thing and then you started

98
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,900
seeing Jimmy Johns and Home Depot on a
lot of the other ones start to happen

99
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,020
it's ok let's not be the next target and
again we're crying wolf about hey let's

100
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,710
not be the next breach but then
something crazy happened something

101
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,710
absolutely awesome

102
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,169
market went off the hook crazy when it
went like in a completely different

103
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,750
direction than any of us could have ever
saw in this is interesting because I

104
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,710
remember looking at most organizations
like I can't get no funding for staff i

105
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,820
cant get funding for this I can't do
this you know i i can't inject into my

106
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,020
business you know all this stuff right
and you have people that are really

107
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,159
freaking out about getting briefed
people are terrified that hey we're

108
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,860
going to be the next person on the news
and any of these cyber weapons right you

109
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,900
know that can completely take over par
entire infrastructure and we have people

110
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,500
that look like this hacking in the
basement breaking into you

111
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,470
organizations doing all this stuff and
then we heard terms like advanced

112
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:39,600
persistent threats and sophistication in
cyber weapons mister to pollute the

113
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,120
executives at all these different things
and what's interesting today is that if

114
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,390
you want to be an apt all you need to
know is is a couple lines of Bosch

115
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,050
because you look at what the techniques
that are leveraging to break into these

116
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,729
companies it's not sophisticated it's
not advance in any way shape or form is

117
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,980
just called hacking that's what we've
been doing for ten years twenty years

118
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,840
thirty years you know in these type of
technique sperm in advance perspective

119
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,030
you look at a lot of the techniques are
breaking take a very simplistic nature

120
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,120
the not dropping 0 days and and
compromising organizations using very

121
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,150
poor concepts but it's giving companies
an excuse

122
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,240
on how to get out of a breach because
they're targeted by an advanced actor or

123
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,600
something that was sophisticated know
you had horrible security practices for

124
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
the past 10 years

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,490
own because you haven't passed a doggie
reader in like 10 years right that's the

126
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,060
reason why you got nothing to do with
being advanced you were targeted because

127
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,949
you have horrible security practices but
it gave something give us an hour but

128
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,220
one thing that was interesting about
this whole movements is something

129
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,760
awesome right

130
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,750
we finally got money we've been talking
about it for twenty years about how we

131
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,580
don't have enough money however have
enough funding how we don't have enough

132
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,570
people I'm going to talks and say well
hey who here has enough funding and

133
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,300
people for their the security program
and the audience laughed and snicker

134
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,109
right you still get that sometimes here
in there but most people feel like

135
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,750
they've got enough budget I you know if
you look at a lot of the the statistics

136
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,650
most security programs are generally
anywhere between 8% to 12% of the

137
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,250
overall I T budget estimates burying
term that can go in different directions

138
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,770
on a phone call two days ago talking to
a customer likes to watch your general

139
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:27,660
you know percentage over 44 42 percent
of ITC 42% like how does that even work

140
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:35,850
when you spend much as I don't know I
have cash ok like what we do what I can

141
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:42,900
get back you know i mean but we got her
wish we now have funding for everything

142
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,079
that we needed to do and start to build
things and the interesting part about

143
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:54,310
this is we SAT there with this big
collar cash and he said now right we sit

144
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,290
there like ok we'll have been
complaining about security for five

145
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,640
years in my organization and I actually
have to do something and now we have 10

146
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,970
million risks and I have to complete
everything in the year right that's not

147
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,860
the directive I got from my organization
that do everything in the year 2000 hire

148
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,130
some people

149
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,930
and say look for talent yet this market
is so crazy that it's hard to find

150
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:21,000
talent especially locations that are
coming from and are RHR departments are

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,130
used to our regular you know type of
hiring a normal person a normal salary

152
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,230
this industry blowing up so big you
can't going get significant talent so

153
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,650
you have to build from the ground up for
you outsource and so you have a shortage

154
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,170
of towns in this industry which happened
but what's interesting is you got this

155
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,969
big Impala cash just sitting there we
don't know what to do with it I got a

156
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,870
million dollars didn't write this in
cash and I don't know what to do with it

157
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:55,710
and so you saw a lack of a check out our
talents and a significant need to

158
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,060
address things very quickly and that's
when we started to see the technology R

159
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,390
and the products and so you have this
whole industry that consume this

160
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,000
industry around technologies saying hey
you by my tool it's gonna be so much

161
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,870
better for you to stop the advanced
persistent threats in the sophistication

162
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,460
all the stuff when you have you know
Tomcat Tomcat web server on the outside

163
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,790
apt is are the least of your concern
right now

164
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,130
the last time that I've used 20 day or
even in exploits on a company has been

165
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,840
years I haven't needed to use an actual
exploits to compromise on organization

166
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,650
in years anybody here pen tester

167
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,600
humor so put your hand on how to use an
exploit the compromise and employ in the

168
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,450
past couple of months

169
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:50,920
oh that's right that's going in the
morning so if anybody had to use an

170
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,699
expert recently to compromise an
important know right it's not an it's

171
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,930
not a a zero deficit compromising so you
get all this technology stuff that

172
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,900
protects against your days you get all
this crap that makes your computer run

173
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,439
texting typically slower and you can
barely even use the damn computer right

174
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,910
they care to give a blood sample and
happy sample to make sure that I can get

175
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,810
my computer I am I saying and obviously
it takes you 16 minutes to log into a

176
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,199
computer because you have to do two
factor authentication your phone your

177
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,970
phone doesn't work you gotta go call by
TV Guide and it's you know it's a six

178
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,700
hour process to get your computer when
you talk about VPN VPN in I had a

179
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,920
customer where they gave me a VPN token
it took me two days of the engagement to

180
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
get access to two days

181
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,760
all this technology to try to protect us
against ABT's and sophistication when we

182
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,200
have the most horrible security program
that is until foundation you look at

183
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,010
this the worldwide cybersecurity market
was valued at seventy seven billion

184
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,680
dollars 2015 is estimated to go to a
hundred and seventy billion by 2020 as

185
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,130
reports many other companies have
doubled their investments researching

186
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,020
and purchasing a technology and so it
seems like every single day is a brand

187
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,220
new piece of technology is coming up
against your ass when it comes to

188
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,040
sophistication and see you see all these
different technologies and as investors

189
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,510
everywhere I don't know about this
market if you have an idea you get a

190
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,439
million dollars for an idea I have an
idea that's going to revolutionize

191
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,709
security it's called turning off the
computer and not letting it run and

192
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:20,660
people will be able to get half a
million dollar idea right so investors

193
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,390
are are throwing cash at this industry
attempting to get some yes this is

194
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,209
becoming so large and see the value in
this was not a lot out there what's

195
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,959
interesting is that there's seriously
because series age who beat UC funding

196
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,699
we know about investments in and getting
funding a lot of stuff you got through a

197
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,700
series do you watch a lot of the
company's at UC now breaking down your

198
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,350
doors are done it means that they
haven't been profitable the first run

199
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,060
improbable second runner on third round
to try to get problems they're blowing

200
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,239
money on marketing and much other crap
is a technology isn't working

201
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,060
and so try to get profitable I get into
these doors and get companies to buy

202
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,050
them but the next revolutionary think
it's gonna stop you

203
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,420
artificial intelligence test up 99% of
hacker seriously that's crazy

204
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:22,790
thing but we we also created a
technology that will stop all hackers

205
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:43,290
about this up here because it doesn't
have sounds of music videos are

206
00:15:43,290 --> 00:16:07,670
literally just messing around this is a
lower than we thought

207
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:24,479
internet to see how busy you just
created

208
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:44,260
wat truck outer must have Rick call the
house ecology test herself for coverage

209
00:16:44,260 --> 00:17:19,629
of stopping all the hacker stressed out
full coverage so quick last Star Trek

210
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:46,990
hospital officials worried

211
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:37,669
so this is a big focus on technology
over talent and and that's really causes

212
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,960
industry to go in a catechal because you
know you have someone that's been

213
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,440
working on essays for ten years or so
you have a network engineering

214
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,799
department that has five people those
five people know if they since I not

215
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:50,840
right you have a pile of cash need to go
home by Paula Walters

216
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:57,789
NXNE next gen technology record next
generation got better and so you have

217
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:00,039
ten years of horrible network design

218
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,539
networks and everything else ok but we
got this awesome next gen technology

219
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,669
stricken use the Cisco importer tool and
import all her shit into this plot on

220
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:14,030
our next how that's supposed to change
and understand like an hour next time

221
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,649
because it gives you a little bit of
analysis on the protocol so now you've

222
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,700
introduced a bunch of new technology
that's complexity and complex in nature

223
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,490
get all the folks that were Cisco folks
now they're trying to figure out how

224
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,870
long does not seem plausible that are
alright but the complexity of something

225
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,610
introduced causes much more than
actually buildings programs so let's

226
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,309
take a look at how and when compromises
working I'll show you one of the new

227
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:42,330
some working on and said it should be on
the next few days but if you look at how

228
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,389
I actively go after an organization
homework right looking at open source

229
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,010
intelligence you know things like that I
developed an attack and then I actually

230
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,100
gonna attack

231
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,959
what's interesting about this this
technique as you could literally go

232
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,850
after anybody that wants it with an
organization and most of the test we do

233
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,020
though in companies like a need to do a
sample size over 20,000 employees

234
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,340
organization I need to sample size I
want you guys to some fish up to 5,000

235
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,980
you know people at once that's not an
accurate test under security program

236
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,690
as an attacker what I typically do I
restart one or two people and I bill

237
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,679
might happen to people and I send an
email or call somebody on the phone with

238
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,830
those one or two people that sit and i
wait that doesn't work and move on 2012

239
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,480
people you know and so it keeps me the
worry about a lot of different things

240
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,450
here on my favorite ones that I always
remember doing is going after a company

241
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,169
that was celebrating 50 years of 150
years of business but they're an

242
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,020
American company and are so happy about
being fifty years in business and

243
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,389
manufacturing space and other stuff and
some of the website you could see it at

244
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,040
all over their site fifty years of being
and an awesome company and they're

245
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,500
really happy about to go to the press
releases and it's all press releases

246
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,150
about and everything and how they love
their employees and also their stuff and

247
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,940
you have an event and also their stuff
and so I sent an email to the person in

248
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,410
charge of the press releases could use a
little contact us on there and she sent

249
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,250
me an email almost immediately and
what's great about that one email is not

250
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,150
the headers and IP addresses coming from
using from exchange infrastructure

251
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,070
technical perspective but how they
perform at their emails now I know you

252
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,899
know how to use this font in this
disclaimer and you know this you know

253
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,190
this type of lettering and also their
stuff sonata for my emails I'm sending

254
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,230
them in and I sent an email out I said
hey you know based on you know fifty

255
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,020
years of being in business we're gonna
send out you know fifty three iPhones in

256
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,049
the employees at that goes through this
this raffle remember I said so the other

257
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:34,049
two people had over a hundred miles on
my system according to other people like

258
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,260
he did you see this morning that when I
get this nuclear cannot provide a

259
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,040
hundred shells you know in my room I
might do with these many shows a pretty

260
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,159
awesome you know what's interesting
about that technique is you know you

261
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,380
entice people but it's super simple and
ridiculous see you know stupid but it's

262
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,799
built off of their company don't expect
you to build an attack on the company

263
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,370
was also kinda funny at that time is I
couldn't ask my permission to operate

264
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,530
and so around four o'clock people
started going home after losing show and

265
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,240
I still didn't happen in 10 foothold
into the environment on the crap you

266
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,000
don't have a lot of time and so I stuck
my phone number coming from this

267
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,510
person's desk I had to be in the Global
Address List in so i stupid phone number

268
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,658
to the help desk and said hey you know i
having issues getting an end in sight

269
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:19,340
see people are so predictable cuz they
get annoyed with people that don't

270
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,409
understand technology

271
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:27,460
it all started like talking and things I
had no idea the RTD low colonel 0 and I

272
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:33,050
read the whole thing was a really long
and I can you try going to CBS

273
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:40,080
Interactive or something like that is is
that is that on my desktop and Peter

274
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,669
Simek what's the address I don't
understand where youre talking about

275
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,730
like you know can you tell me a little
bit tell the person getting annoyed and

276
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,310
a remote into this person's computer and
I gotta get access into the environment

277
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,629
is great so you know those are
techniques you can leverage in like

278
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,770
cases if you're in a pinch but that's a
homer no one my favorite ones that I

279
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:06,730
recently did a segment on CNN is people
when they go after helped us typically

280
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,740
like you know try to reset password or
something like that right that's ok in

281
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,580
most cases because you need to know a
lot of information about somebody takes

282
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,590
a lot of time and I'm a lazy person I
don't get there in time for the last

283
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,490
four somebody social security number or
an employee of the year things like that

284
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,790
so we can do a lot of cases in this has
been effective for me time and time

285
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,540
again has put your phone number coming
from you know your internal company

286
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,600
thing that you don't have to call for me
so I want you can call from a different

287
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,320
you know

288
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,530
country don't look at them care but we
did you ask them you know to go to upset

289
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,330
No go to about verifying a lot of the
employees things and that's what I did

290
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,939
here on CNN article

291
00:24:46,840 --> 00:25:42,689
we got a customer to allow us to do it
as long as we can username and any way

292
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,790
shape or form so it's funny the first
time I called the answer with their

293
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,850
their their company names of the Cliq
tried calling and got somebody else is

294
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,010
cool so this is actually my second
attempt at it but we got permission to

295
00:25:53,010 --> 00:26:07,570
go into this so this is a company that's
how i mean it could be a stupid thing

296
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:19,439
I'm so it's it's it's it's WWW dot
survey asks you are why dash crow dot

297
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:30,650
com here's what the eighty I didn't
realize I quickly indeed full well

298
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,200
that's where doctor said it was fine now
I really didn't have a really appreciate

299
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,380
the help

300
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:50,190
the funny thing is that in doing
research in your common sense I just

301
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,030
found their help this number by calling
them in line and then called a couple

302
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,879
places and that was it was like you know
a couple minutes

303
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,030
you know we're getting into
infrastructure and I'll show you how a

304
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:03,000
detector using these two attackers funny
because this method HTH are nothing new

305
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,910
there's this old book it's Mike 1998 or
something that's a rainbow book it's a

306
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,080
really fat and thick it's a

307
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,750
looks like you know like a horrible
computer book in this room opens to find

308
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,800
it and I paid like one thousand or
something like that it's like hey

309
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,919
there's this we can use each decals to
completely hack into a computer that was

310
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,180
a 1997 it still available be invaluable
today's

311
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,870
worked great today so this method I
definitely was quite a bit in just a

312
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,050
second but it's funny because you know
people are very predictable a lot of

313
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,270
ways you wanna be helpful in life
situations in a lot of different

314
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,139
techniques you can use of social
engineering a good example of that as I

315
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,330
was doing a thing for a news
organization and the anchor want me to

316
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:49,350
hack into her boss ok ok fine whatever
in so I look up the persons name in you

317
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,679
know I won't say which news organization
is a whore but you know look at the

318
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,450
person's name and the person happen to
be in Paris don't mean a thing for this

319
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,910
this new organization and despite all of
that and so I call my phone number and I

320
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:07,470
thought I come from a 100 number I don't
care what it was but also look who the

321
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,950
credit card providers were a lot of
times you'll see like press releases and

322
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,960
things were like no big company will say
oh we partner with Chase or partner with

323
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,450
so insofar corporate card or credit
cards to find a press articles from Mike

324
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,030
you know 2010 that said hey we partnered
with you know say chases an example and

325
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:27,260
so I put the car on a calling number
from my number and called this is called

326
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,990
bob and I said hey Bob this is so answer
from Chase card services here I were

327
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,230
noticing some strange activities most
recent look like in in paris are you

328
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,550
currently in Paris right now and what I
was doing as I was when I make myself

329
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,730
available rates and services company I
know what company has per my credit card

330
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,260
perspective and I know that he's
traveling to France I built a little bit

331
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,780
of a poor on a couple of seconds to
establish myself

332
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,120
anything here that that bob is and you
know allocations kind of public you know

333
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,520
and he's kind of like agitated little
bit he's like yeah yeah I mean I mean

334
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,470
I'm in Paris everything's fine ok no
problem

335
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,800
ok we'll have to go over a couple of of
these charges from you really quick if

336
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,970
you don't mind you could tell Bob sent
to get a little noise and that's kind of

337
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,240
a dangerous situation because they
normally just clicking on hang up on you

338
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,020
both of those opportunities to do
something quick I was gonna put him off

339
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,170
center so that I can get control of the
situation and I can dictate the things

340
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:24,530
that happen next and so is it ok bob you
know did you spend you know $1,250 at

341
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,530
German dungeon porn.com

342
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,290
no no no that's not me that's not me i'm
ok ok I did you spend you know in a

343
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:38,760
horrible stomach animals and you know
it's terrible and body is completely

344
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,830
embarrassing a public location and bob
is at this point I'm taking these things

345
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,600
very seriously right he's very scared
about what's going on and so I say okay

346
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,379
but no problem you know I just verify
these and I'll get him on knocked off

347
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,380
and when are you coming back from France
will monitor activity only allowed

348
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,440
charges coming from France and also
thank you so much is horrible I don't

349
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,670
know how this happened but we don't have
a lot of time to travel overseas but

350
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,170
what I need to do is a need to repeat
the names that just at the values that I

351
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:11,860
can remove marker account like us know
that you really like your body needs to

352
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,889
verify your folks here for credit card
number so I can remove it started

353
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,950
getting a little credit card number get
a Social Security number and ask you

354
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:28,680
things like his wife but it's you know
79 poor you know so you know you can do

355
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,820
what you need to you based off of
targeting individuals in in creating a

356
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,980
fantasy that seems so this is using the
attack back there and this is my

357
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,040
favorite song and said now this new
version that I've been working on is

358
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,240
pretty cool because it's what a lot of
like virus companies are doing things

359
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,820
like that as they're looking for
specific methods of like power injection

360
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,929
now so PowerShell you know by far is is
one of the easiest ways to compromise an

361
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,990
organization and not have to be traced
remnants of what's going on

362
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,780
but you know it's like things like
powerful empire for example getting a

363
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,500
lot of popularity lot of talks and
researcher going up our show on you know

364
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,960
and folk music at all of these things
that we leverage spent testers but also

365
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,690
the attackers do same type of thing

366
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,800
non-personal get pretty savvy at
Powershot injection and so the methods

367
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,960
III released in this new version I
actually called Powershot any way shape

368
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,020
or form so it actually does partial
injection with alcohol calling

369
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,970
PowerShell so obviously all of that so
that is not actually calling card so you

370
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,100
don't get picked up by things like you
know anybody looking for like the last

371
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,209
person that I really upset was getting
picked up by Symantec I'm like that's

372
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,309
where the picking up power so whatever
they look at it and I start going

373
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,790
through it and they had a hard-coded
variable name in one of my command

374
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,649
parameters and so I changed the name to
be randomized complete got through

375
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,710
semantic my so you literally wrote a
signature for my school because of one

376
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,030
pram internets how you did it seriously
that's how bad those are but anyway so

377
00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:04,149
it minimizes all that now it's even
better so he took it and so I'm gonna go

378
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,630
to the changing attacks which number one
in every little more the better

379
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,449
what's that attack vectors which number
2 I'm gonna go to the HDU tech sector

380
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:22,300
was number eight now again you know the
lab I'll ask folks like 10 testers and

381
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,050
things like that like he went last time
that you use an expert would you use to

382
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,740
get access to an organization lots I'm
still job app with are still very very

383
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,330
predominant obtaining access embedded
Excel macros are still very applicable

384
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,860
and unusable you know still a lot of
methods but this one might seem kind of

385
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,620
hokey but it works every time for us was
funny because martin was doing a pen

386
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,300
test operate my boss and he was in a pen
testing we're laughing and using it to

387
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,639
text back to NM and Justin elsie was you
know just like all these factors that's

388
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,070
going to work and make it part of my god
yes I can only guess Kiwi delete keys

389
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,070
and everything and they went launched it
and we got like almost like nineteen

390
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,820
ninety-four percent success rate on
everything that we hit right I think the

391
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,830
two people that we didn't get one
because they were out of town so you

392
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,020
know I was like seriously that really
work that works great ok so nice to

393
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,020
start switching to a Hdez

394
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:28,360
honor and I'm going to clone like
whatever and amenorrhea Peter S 430 this

395
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,870
is a traditional maternity overseas to
BS I do a little bit of funky

396
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,449
configurations when I built this so that
standing with her cell doesn't get

397
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:41,430
picked up for example cannot but when
you download the rehearsal HTTPS US

398
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,280
theatres and actually download the PDF
file so it's actually tried downloading

399
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,590
an executable so it when your first day
jitters and Down Goes the internet and

400
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:55,330
actually goes into it so it's done on
the internet most content filtering

401
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,909
stubble typically block that right so he
can do it if you start enable states

402
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,350
including two true in randomized is that
I'm using Shikata which is the old

403
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,770
encoder but it over the wire and I think
it picked up anything and so it's

404
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,020
actually like Rob blah blah date of this
going back so that gets passed on a lot

405
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,280
of that stuff and also the default on
nearly all certificates topical

406
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:22,030
aesthetic cases in there so I pass those
that want to go through so I generate

407
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:29,570
everything for us and

408
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,810
what happens in a specific attack is is
when it injection

409
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,168
injects the code used a technique that
Matthew Graber really create which is

410
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:45,060
like one of the best partial folks
everybody check him out one of the best

411
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,049
parts of your life

412
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:52,069
got a huge man crush on him but he came
up with a technique that allows you to

413
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:56,449
inject shoko directly to memory through
our show is really awesome and another

414
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:00,770
powerful process what I did is is you
know we have to do is you have to

415
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,119
determine whether or not it was 6432
been in use a specific command for each

416
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,880
one and when using said I don't want to
have to spray a 64 bit and 32 bit or a

417
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,500
32 bit and 64 bit and cost issues and so
did the new attack vectors called x86

418
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,560
downgrade which looks for the operating
system that it's in and it's great that

419
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,730
process the 32 bit processor cars and
sports a partial process maturity

420
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,819
perspective I'm so you basically what
you need if there's a show called on a

421
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:32,099
64 bit platform or just use that doesn't
cause of the crash in which is not at

422
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:32,530
all

423
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:40,210
into this and I will go to the state

424
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:52,180
should use it thx interesting because
they actually at the click Run her so

425
00:35:52,180 --> 00:36:07,379
much and I am running a sort of like
nine gigs of ram in the slowest thing

426
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,109
I've ever do that with my entire life so
you have to hit open ok that's one thing

427
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:18,299
that a user has to do which you know my
seem like it's kind of crazy and then

428
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:37,640
we're doing coaching change the military
vehicles that had open minded and open

429
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,029
access to this now what's interesting is
that different browsers have hearing

430
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:44,980
things like Chrome and Firefox will
actually show that it signed by

431
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,309
Microsoft Corporation and you want
Microsoft Corporation actually going

432
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:52,910
running errands for Microsoft it's gonna
be good but you can build and your

433
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,788
pretext like hey you need to open this
up that very question the one of those

434
00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:00,220
he wants it I do like employer employee
benefits and meet the verify that it's

435
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,500
your computer so quick open when you
actually go into it and you get access

436
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,529
to the computer and all that good stuff
that soldiers had opened a very high has

437
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:09,400
also our technique in here in a long
time to go through but Cheryl fast

438
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,400
clickjacking checking

439
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,690
objecting say got a social sharing tax
website X Factor and its subject matter

440
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,860
number five so that real quick 'cause
clone

441
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:32,580
training gmail orkut yeah thanks for all
the time

442
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,280
want specifically is because it

443
00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:04,150
advantage of everything that we know
about education awareness so what I

444
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,540
would do is build this pretext up in a
way that you know has a nice and pretty

445
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,910
page that's pretty website and I was so
you know how to make sure you hire you

446
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,899
hover over the link and make sure that
it's going to you know benefits got

447
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,660
trust sector com obviously find a third
party website that does this year when I

448
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:25,770
highlight over this key the key the
bottom left-hand side still small but it

449
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,700
says account like google.com right
there's no trickery that says HTTPS

450
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,120
calling for court / account stock
google.com message it right click that

451
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,020
it should be perfectly fine right right
click it and I was actually go to a

452
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,530
counselor calm but it does a quick
redirect to a malicious website and now

453
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,370
we've taken control of that right so you
make it believable

454
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,660
site obviously had registered a domain
name and things like that but it

455
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,569
redirects in cash whatever you want you
can live forever attack you wanna go

456
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:00,570
after all those things gets to those
good things so another easy way of

457
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:08,650
getting us so that's some easy ways of
getting it right now but we use my main

458
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,370
method of exploitation or message me
method of expectations till this day or

459
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,819
executables by far PE files are the the
main method dropping executables on the

460
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,820
machine ransomware still uses
executables fact that you know

461
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,970
everybody's freaking out about
ransomware is an indication that we have

462
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,410
poor security practices of stopping
executables in our environments as

463
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,089
interesting as they had a a large
finance institution call me on the phone

464
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,850
and say hey Dave can we can you help us
out with their business kinda mean

465
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,860
disaster recovery program making sure no
problem they were trying to figure out

466
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,980
how to address transforming sure I'll be
happy to give you some good ideas on

467
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,310
backup strategies and also stopped like
know when to use you and buy bitcoins

468
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,080
from use that in the event that we have
an issue we can just pay the ransom not

469
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,350
be interrupted

470
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:51,500
are you serious

471
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:00,280
really ok anyways everything is slowly
moving to PowerShell knowledge can be

472
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,950
bashing windows which I thought was
amazing it's gonna be great awesome that

473
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,790
was interesting about this is that the
argument is that it just takes one and

474
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,610
this is the one we always use the red
team

475
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,990
technique right hey I can always
breaking just takes me wonderful ought

476
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,620
to get my member you have to stop a
thousand difference

477
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,600
vulnerabilities right that's always been
the argument was interesting as Jeremiah

478
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,000
in retrospect a lot and Egypt ever
smoked a lot from Jeremiah said it said

479
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,240
an adversary just needs to find one
vulnerability to win to do that they

480
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,609
just need to find one system at the
target doesn't know they own that's a

481
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:40,050
great example what he just said
counterpoint once you're on a system

482
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,830
adversary roles reverse blue only needs
to find one indicator compromise to

483
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:49,230
catch them that's so true as an attacker
guess I only need one plot against your

484
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,050
infrastructure but it only takes me one
message that you have a detective

485
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,580
capability to actually going catch me
for not building those detection

486
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,770
capabilities into our environment to
look for them and that's the big

487
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,110
difference yet you might have a thousand
or million risks but great detection you

488
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,630
stop it on day 1 vs day twenty that's a
lot better the situation that you're on

489
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,890
the air before some of the things I love
tokens that Tony Jackson me up as a pen

490
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,900
tester I highly recommend incorporate
environment and it's not it's not impact

491
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,130
at all it's very easy you can do it like
a day and what honey tokens are as you

492
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:27,000
create a specific amino say the current
release next next next week and is

493
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,230
actually here but what happens is it
creates it sees it as a scheduled task

494
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,560
in your environment than 11 today

495
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,060
and it creates a process and suspend
mode and it creates a process using fake

496
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,120
credentials and I recommend creating a
domain admin accounts a legit domain

497
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,160
admin account that you don't use it like
a five hundred character password or

498
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,210
something like that right and and locked
up in a statement ever use it and what

499
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,230
you do is you create this account to
make it look like a good password right

500
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,690
like you know hey this is a super
awesome domain admin one password right

501
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:00,870
and what i doin attackers with this the
cytokinin the scheduled task is it

502
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:05,290
shoots in the memory when I compromise
machine i'm looking for those tokens if

503
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,730
I find a domain admin token I'm going
after that token in two seconds to find

504
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,890
that city have that in their oh there's
a dynamic talking I'm gonna check real

505
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,609
quick to make sure it's legit account
you know he also legit account ok I'm

506
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:22,340
going to use that energy use it he look
for the login login failure which is

507
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:28,080
46254 log on for that specific account
and that is a hey I need to respond

508
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,890
immediately to someone is in my
environment from a machine that I need

509
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:37,129
to specific event log contains a remote
address as well as its longtime 33 and

510
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,100
is going to have the hostname username
of these exactly what you need to be

511
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,730
able to detect that that's a great
benefit is also something you can do

512
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,680
those were my favorites its revenues
responder a lemon orange and indian US

513
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,339
tax write letters like cheating ok thank
you let me put it on then you get credit

514
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:58,280
and you never can go to the magic and
fix it was great but what's great about

515
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,830
this one has been there were doing a
course taught in South Dakota and they

516
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:08,380
have to figure out a way up there so to
get had a calm and I'll post all this I

517
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,870
got to get up that com slash minor
depends I'm gonna put all up here on

518
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:17,480
Monday so you see it there but Ben
Rhodes PowerShell scripts that you can

519
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,610
leverage as well that sends out fake and
DNS and 11 are queries and it's too easy

520
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:27,220
you can do this one is put a domain name
domain admin username password and

521
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,299
they're right you can specify a password
to put that same one in there and wait

522
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,490
for a failed login attempts ok

523
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:40,209
the second thing you can do is detecting
responder in your environment when you

524
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,710
actually send out that PowerShell
command he wrote

525
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,570
what will happen is that a little sweet
the networking if anybody response

526
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,770
responder has to actually catch inside
yet I met you can send me your data ok

527
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:55,259
what happens if you see it about log
4648 explicit crowds were used in order

528
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,859
to log into an in a remote system with
that specific account you know that

529
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,420
responders internet work because no one
should ever be accepting those

530
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,310
credentials on your network and and and
communicate with it and saying that the

531
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,950
host name is actually a proactive
mechanism just waiting for the crack the

532
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,750
password to get access into your
environment you gonna look for those

533
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,490
specific ones that actually find that on
your network which is really awesome so

534
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:21,069
I'll be releasing that source code
PowerShell with shoppers and five for

535
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:24,070
some amazing detection capabilities you
put into it specifically with

536
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:29,240
enable scripts script blah blah blah
climbing you can get the actual

537
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,129
PowerShell command itself you can
actually pull in PowerShell commands and

538
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,619
all that good stuff actually stop
PowerShell to have good access controls

539
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:41,660
in your environment you have people that
are not local admins you can see an app

540
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,440
Locker which you have a partner policy
disallow power said he'd seen you the

541
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,460
other lines for anybody other than local
admin and it can literally stopped

542
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,780
PowerShell for money in your entire
environment so there's so many different

543
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,810
ways you can mess with us as attackers
those are just a couple understanding

544
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,980
red makes you better those techniques
really messed me up as an attacker and

545
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,180
it seemed tax that the other people
using 2008 actors in China and Russia

546
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,919
and Iran and North Korea third crazy
cyber weapons are destroying companies

547
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,940
with right you know there isn't the same
type of techniques that we leverage on a

548
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,970
regular basis the truth of the matter is
that ten years of neglect isn't fixed

549
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:19,379
with one year of investment it takes
time to build all these up it takes time

550
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,130
to build all your programs in to
understand that and so understanding

551
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,690
that being being blue is also about
being right now you have to have that

552
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,710
mindset of being purple you have to
understand both of them in your part of

553
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,060
your job isn't just understand a piece
of technology about understanding that

554
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:41,470
we face a lot of issues and ability to
look at that they came out and said what

555
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,848
threats challenges are you a great
concern

556
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:49,079
and its to top one by far our
sophisticated attacks targeting at your

557
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,759
organization the second one was fishing
social network exploits other forms of

558
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:58,529
social engineering what we actually
spent time on search capabilities

559
00:45:58,529 --> 00:46:02,150
introduced through the purchase of
off-the-shelf software internal mistakes

560
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,660
or external attacks that caused me
organization to meet compliance security

561
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,739
vulnerabilities introduced my own
application development accidental daley

562
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,579
and users who fail to follow security
policy and permit is fish emulsion

563
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:18,619
arcing exploits and so are our jobs here
dealing with fires on a regular basis

564
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:21,489
versus actually proactively going out
looking for these things as the term

565
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:26,450
because we hear a lot about which is a
very solid practice by going out and so

566
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,649
we can't be a mystery to one another how
we do things you know our focus needs to

567
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:34,920
shift to understand a lot of different
things that were doing from a security

568
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,220
perspective look at complexity complex
eased up one of the largest issues that

569
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,009
we face as well

570
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:43,559
introducing complex environments new
piece of technology just know that if

571
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:46,849
you buy peace technology you have to
have two or three people that support

572
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:51,249
that technology right you can't you like
him from the new policies we just got so

573
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:55,218
that he can do deal he now she's here
she doesn't work that way you can't

574
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,940
believe that took it away

575
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,779
require that users i dont organizations
they have all these awesome programs

576
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:07,229
like how do you what do you do for
detecting the text points we don't do

577
00:47:07,229 --> 00:47:12,960
any event logs and don't do any point
you don't have any visibility about loss

578
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,989
can literally find most of the stuff
that's out there so much information on

579
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:20,670
that there's a call W my intrinsic and
extrinsic events you can create those

580
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,239
for some amazing pieces of information I
have a couple of samples that you can

581
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,729
pull from a crippled escalation I'll be
releasing on Monday as well but you can

582
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:31,799
leverage those the query and look for
specific indicators are you that I

583
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:36,019
all-time high of scripts ago power cord
W mine and pull the data back then you

584
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,629
look for these are looking for

585
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:43,200
so in order for business to operate a
balance between security controls and

586
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,558
awareness is is critical and and I would
spend a lot of time on this justice

587
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:50,729
specific topic but the culture that you
still security has to be one that's

588
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,710
healthy and has to be one that's
positive

589
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,930
if you guys are the draconian folks in
your organization stopping everything

590
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,569
that you look at it again your two
highest likelihood areas are going to be

591
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:06,099
using population your prisoner
penetration testing is an interesting

592
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:09,410
topic because you know normally it's one
of those things where it's like a young

593
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:12,670
apprentice done annually you take those
results and you kind of fix them and you

594
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,040
might do a little bit with the defenses
around it for finding is that you need

595
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,810
to have a team either internal or
external whatever that focuses

596
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,109
longer-term working with your booty I
just had a purple team exercise where

597
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:28,130
our objective was apprenticed better
term but that wasn't the focus the focus

598
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,730
was building the defensive capabilities
inside the organization and they had

599
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:35,390
company working with a massive
organization across the world they're

600
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,420
leveraging our carbon black and and what
we don't care what or leveraging

601
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,140
protection wherever you decide to buy is
fine but we came out like seventy two

602
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,609
different watch lists for how they can
attack power saw injection liquor

603
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:49,880
privatization looking at labor movement
lacked know all those things that we

604
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,550
want to do that exercise just a week
engagement can you imagine that was

605
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,160
spent over a month or two months or
three months or four months you have to

606
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,410
have those exercises the environment the
detection become something that is so

607
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,770
much better than anything else out there
it's cool that you buy that has the

608
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,869
depot use cases isn't gonna happen in
there I wasn't talking about but by the

609
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:10,720
time for that unfortunately but I'll be
released next week

610
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,689
tokens suspicious about the text and
Senate action I'll post a link of bands

611
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:22,380
out there that really jacked up at 10
testers that's our get home page right

612
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:27,630
there so it's getting back on defense
and you can also do get a.com all the

613
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:33,400
offensive tools that I write all time
hillary anybody has ever 2.0 a sec

614
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,629
heads to complete nightmare to manage
because you have to develop key pairs so

615
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,109
I wrote an entire protocol that
automatic automate the installation and

616
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:44,940
provisioning of all the keys you can
deploy IBM assigns entire organization

617
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,310
that's up on there as well

618
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,630
medications that I really like
compromising machine the randomizer

619
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,859
disabling of local admin accounts that
is why I should be able to move

620
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:57,098
laterally to other systems so disabling
your local admin account only using you

621
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:00,120
know the county can do that

622
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,730
solar use a privileged accounts domain
damaged every logging into members there

623
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,150
was a period ever

624
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,440
why do you have to login to members of
islamic no stansky per domain and only

625
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,530
log controllers and make another council
member servers remove that I can't get

626
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:17,530
to access the thing that I want access
to excessive account usages management

627
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:22,170
is still keep breaking that people using
stuff from like 2000 57 I don't

628
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:26,430
understand how possible we are feeling
so bad if we have a mystery to 67 in our

629
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:32,190
environments terrible start basic
binaries you know application

630
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,720
whitelisting actually does a decent job
at certain things I'm a big fan of

631
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,700
application that lets meet you can
deploy it not perfect in any sense

632
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,930
doesn't stop against power some stuff
like that but does a decent job

633
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:46,069
execution and point visibility is huge
this this GPO right here

634
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,830
completely this one is the worst GPO
that that you can put in your

635
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:54,240
environment for me as an attacker if you
can figure this to deny access computer

636
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,040
networking remove the local
Administrators group from that it

637
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,910
totally up to me because I can't do
things like

638
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:04,190
exact or you know you know W my
injections to like I can't do that type

639
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:09,750
of stuff with this specific policy
enable so you put this into motion is is

640
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:14,460
that is not local but you know Chris
specific group says hey folks rabin's

641
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,970
whatever in a domain that really messes
me up so last but not least we all need

642
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,540
to be purple I learned so much working
with the blue team about how they defend

643
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:28,920
against things in-house make me a better
hackers while the kids but we work

644
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,860
together to figure out each other to
understand each other because there is

645
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,580
no longer hey I'm on the red team on the
booty its hey we're on the purple team

646
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,890
working together to figure things out
and that's what we have to do is a good

647
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,580
book I recommend reading it has nothing
to security at all it's called originals

648
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,850
and if the guy a professor at the
wharton and I he wrote this book about

649
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:50,810
how nonconformist can change the world
and help people that dont attached to a

650
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,770
certain rational thinking can go in and
change and industry for the better and I

651
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,720
HIGHLY believe that we have those people
in this industry today

652
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,290
you know we're told hey you know a pen
test we need to do a pen test annually

653
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:05,140
building your own pen test team you know
do your own stuff internally it's great

654
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,520
fantastic job and I'm fine with that and
go start BCSO summer

655
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:16,930
our security but you know you do
something that that makes a difference

656
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,859
in your organization are doing it for
the industry as a whole it's very easy

657
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,850
to complain to say that we're horrible
as an industry is very easy to complain

658
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:27,390
that everything's messed up completely
different personnel changes and you look

659
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:30,109
at this book it's people like you know
Steve Jobs who you know had his own

660
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:35,390
laundry list the failures right and how
he overcame those when he was able to do

661
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:38,629
other folks that have done things that
just change the destructive to complete

662
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:45,640
a mission to make it better you can do
the same questions thank you very much

663
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,279
appreciated thanks
