1
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,169
and it

2
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,219
you know mysteries of the universe that
always get me so this was a shot I took

3
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,500
from the flight as we're coming in

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,420
coming in to land two days ago class I
don't what a beautiful shot and then

5
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,579
took it and then never got a little bit
closer on approach I saw some chips

6
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,019
there and little did I know that when I
thought these ships and they took the

7
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:07,030
picture that I actually solve the needle
mystery found them at this was actually

8
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,979
a photo I took from the plane coming in
so this is not something I found online

9
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:14,580
but the really interesting thing is this
really hammered home something that I

10
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,819
like to talk about is getting into the
details in the minutiae of the

11
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,940
discussion of the problems that I have
in media and I have made this mistake

12
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,679
myself in the past as we don't get to
the meat of it we don't actually discuss

13
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:32,020
what the real problems are as either
practitioners or media hora together and

14
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,810
I often feel like I'm an old man
shouting at the clouds go figure I'm

15
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,929
working for a cloud provider who saw
that coming and when we're going through

16
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,740
the media and we're looking at all these
things they're talking about DDoS and

17
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,079
admittedly in the TOS in the title but
don't stick to that but these type of

18
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,508
attacks are never really gotten into any
sort of detail with regards to media and

19
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,429
I don't mean to beat up the media it's
just it's one of those disconnects that

20
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:02,990
I want to actually talk to because they
want you to feel fear and not because

21
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,420
they're malicious by any stretch of the
imagination but they're saying they're

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,310
going these are the bad things are gonna
get you and you put in security controls

23
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,100
you may predict what are you putting the
right security controls are you actually

24
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,070
defending yourself properly and this is
a perfect example that running and see

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,390
so in this particular case this
highlights an issue this looks like a

26
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,130
really scary problem and the media like
to go on about these sort of things to

27
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,130
my two-year-old this is absolutely
terrifying although not a real threat

28
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,890
and not the problem I see with think
threat is that we're seeing about this

29
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,630
new media lot like dormant cyber
pathogens and thanks to a demise for

30
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,859
putting that traffic together for me
these are things that really concerns me

31
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,489
because we're losing focus on what the
actual problems are and we're not

32
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:54,440
looking at data from various platforms
and these stories really left me one

33
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,890
thing that brings me to being right here
so just put in case in point the type of

34
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,850
data that were pulling from our platform
this is a question I would know the

35
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,609
answer to but it anybody in this room
not been online in last 30 days exactly

36
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,069
every one of you is in our logs at some
point but just shows you the breadth and

37
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,660
scope of the type of data that we're
dealing with and as a result of having

38
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,209
that much data available to us we can
see some really cool things developing

39
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:26,950
so does the game plan that i'm gonna
wander through I'm gonna talk briefly

40
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,339
about actors types of the tax tools
trends and where do we take it from here

41
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,870
and all of this is driven based on the
data that we've collected so when I

42
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,840
presented on certain items people say I
only you're here and certainly noticed

43
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,190
this is actual raw data with no filters
attached so early on in my career I came

44
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,109
across various types like this online

45
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,620
actors for higher digital mercenaries
from one of the better term and I

46
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,510
thought wow this is pretty and I went
through it I was looking at the various

47
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,750
types service they would hire and it was
really intriguing to me that they

48
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,799
thought they could get away with this
and in some cases they have really good

49
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,430
ones don't get caught but the audacity
of these characters really comes through

50
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,430
when you look at something like this now
this is a part of a menu item that we

51
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,100
found online about three years ago two
or three years ago now

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,580
little bit dated but this is a Russian
underground site and these are the

53
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,159
prices that they had put up and for the
various services they don't you wanna

54
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,350
hack into a corporate email box costing
$500 so on and so forth we get right

55
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:44,260
down to it you look at the US but now
$700 two maybe three years ago and that

56
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,420
price has dropped dramatically and I'll
talk about that a little bit later on so

57
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:58,210
the fear that people have with regards
to these sort of characters can often be

58
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,900
mitigated by positive stuff now this is
actually a service then went live

59
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,929
roughly a year ago and when I first
heard this presentation North 2nd

60
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,840
Montreal Quebec the did his presentation
and by the time the slides were done and

61
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,260
two hours after that this site had been
compromised and all of the people

62
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,980
participants the late so given points
for trying and fortunately it didn't pan

63
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,060
out so this was a service where you
could put your turkey you gonna sign up

64
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,850
and say I'm available depend s on X Y
and Z and they would find contract work

65
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,060
for you so the right idea for 10
execution and I really hammered home the

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,670
problems of you know blue vs Red teams
that the kennedy was talking about

67
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,600
yesterday and when you're looking at the
types of actors and threats and you have

68
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,060
to deal with one of the most prevalent
one of course there's the board kids now

69
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,940
the board kids I always have a real
problem with not because of what they're

70
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,490
doing but because they haven't been bad
people taking the time to pull the signs

71
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,710
say these are real problems these are
things that you need to be concerned

72
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,169
about because this could negatively
impact you further down the road and

73
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,690
they are looking for in a lot of cases
sense of belonging something that they

74
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,480
can be a part of the can contribute to
because as with any teenager or twenty

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,210
I'm very upset they're angry at the
world they want to find some way that

76
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,130
they can actually make a difference or
belong to something bigger than

77
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,280
themselves

78
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,479
and when they make these decisions and
without proper guidance these decisions

79
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,350
can often go horribly wrong and when
these situations go wrong it can impact

80
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,480
them for later years this Google David
Cameron and pig now these folks were

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,050
before I get to this

82
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,250
these things kids are disposable
workforce has a lot of places that these

83
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,780
kids live or reside they tend to be
below the age of majority and if they

84
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,559
get caught

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,090
get a slap on the hand a lot of them
that record will not follow them into

86
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:08,169
adult so for a motivated operator these
are great disposable workforce and they

87
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,169
really don't particularly care if they
get caught

88
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,880
now the activists are the easiest
example because they are splashed across

89
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,830
the media on a regular basis whether or
not you agree with their politics they

90
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,210
are very effective at what they do and
the problem that I see when they're

91
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,159
calling themselves something like
anonymous is it's right up there with

92
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,140
Kaizer Soze anybody can be this person
or character or operator and it's not

93
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,810
necessarily somebody motivated with the
best intentions and when you think about

94
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,510
that for a second you have no idea who
you're dealing with and this could

95
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,080
actually really go badly and it can go
even worse when you look at it from the

96
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,659
perspective of a nation state actor if
nixon state actors are in your threat

97
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,300
model then you're doing something very
serious if you're building teddy bears

98
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,640
we not so much but this one of those
things is what is the risk to your

99
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,560
organization are these folks actually a
problem for you and when you looking at

100
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,669
nation state actors you've got your
standard the loans which are commonly

101
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:14,560
trudged out sorry dragged out for the
likes of the Sony Pictures Sony Pictures

102
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,680
reach you still have problem believing
it was them and then right up to your

103
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,620
arch villains and

104
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,050
these folks are you know they are real
threat to certain folks certain

105
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,100
operations certain environments and you
really have to look at what is the

106
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,279
riskier environment and I hope you
appreciate that by virtue of me putting

107
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,549
this particular picture of actually
broken the law in Russia they can act as

108
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,779
I made a deal for this one if I ever go
there enough not no rush so when you're

109
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,370
looking at state sponsored actors a
great example for a few years back early

110
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,510
al-qassam cyber fighters now the
al-qassam cyber fighters were a brother

111
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,160
a depth organization that ostensibly
rolled up under some branch of the

112
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,910
Iranian government this has never been
fully unwound but this seems to be

113
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,890
fairly sound in its assessment these
folks were attacking financial

114
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,370
institutions all over the United States
unfortunately they also attacked

115
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,800
organizations in Canada where I'm from
and I really tried to figure out why are

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,140
they were attacking Canada when they
were angry at the united states and at

117
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,350
some point it actually came out that
they did not understand the candidate

118
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,300
United States were separate because it
looked like the same land mass on a map

119
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,949
so these folks he's a tool called robot
not talk about that little bit more

120
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,930
later but this was a very effective
platform that they could actually pick

121
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,870
up their attacks within a space of about
five minutes so if you are being

122
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,060
attacked by vector X and you block that
vector they could pivot very quickly to

123
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,449
a different way of attacking you and the
thing was when they said they were going

124
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,870
to attack you they showed up and they
did it unlike their models but that too

125
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,670
so some of the attacks and i wanna talk
about are gonna be doing with volumetric

126
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,209
application layer as well as protocol
base attacks now by virtue of the fact

127
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,329
that we have so much data available to
us when we go through it we look at the

128
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,680
different types of attack vectors and
one of the things that really jumps out

129
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,439
at me especially in this first life here
is that the top three attacks that they

130
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
have here a local file inclusion
sequence action and cross-site scripting

131
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,060
can anybody tell me how long sequel
injection has been on the top 10

132
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,720
close enough I was gonna set the decade
but thirteen years probably actually

133
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,970
accurate this is a solvable problem and
the attackers are looking for it because

134
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,510
it still works because applications are
getting pushed out the market in a very

135
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,700
quick expeditious fashion and in a lot
of cases the project manage go out of

136
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,830
their way to bypass security how do I
know this because I had eaten the souls

137
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,380
of so many project managers it's not
funny now from looking at a loss over

138
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,340
TCP we look at the types of attacks
again

139
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,360
well if I in sequins exonerate the top
in this particular case it appears the

140
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,690
injection but PHP is such an interesting
piece of work but again back to the

141
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,990
things they're hitting our stuff that
are solvable items if we are doing

142
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,590
proper patch management if we're doing
proper configuration management it's not

143
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:21,060
sexy but it's so easy for us to do a
better job at it as defenders now in

144
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,609
addition these types of things that
they're looking for the types of attacks

145
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,500
that we see on a nonstop basis you know
since you to be floods in the rest

146
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,370
anecdotally on our own platform were
dropping about to terabits attack

147
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,520
traffic continuously and that's not even
the stuff that we login process this is

148
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,260
just the cross that we drop so it's
absolutely amazing how much attack

149
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,720
traffic is out there on the internet and
we're only a portion of it at any given

150
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,070
point removing about 30% of the Internet
across our platform so take that amplify

151
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,050
it out for the rest of the night pat is
a lot of attack traffic and the vast

152
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,490
majority of it really does fall under
volumetric base attacks against

153
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,830
infrastructure and I would have hoped
when I put an academic paper on that I'm

154
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,250
an academic that they were going after
stuff like application-based attacks and

155
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,750
things like that where they can get the
real meat of it but I guess automatic

156
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,460
tax or just that much simpler and I'll
talk about that a little bit more in a

157
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,460
moment but how many folks in this room
know who this character's yes I know

158
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,760
it's Sunday ron was done if anybody
knows Starcraft the game this is a

159
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,800
character called the third and if you're
playing this game you referred to build

160
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,620
up your resources build up their weapons
and all that sort of thing and then

161
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,209
these characters would show up and
destroy everything

162
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:37,748
pretty aggravating when you're playing
the game and if you know this game you

163
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:42,610
know how old I am now this was an
absolute frustrating thing and this is

164
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,629
very much how I envision it when I'm
looking at it from the perspective of

165
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,379
denial of service attack and when I
explained it to see sweet types that are

166
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:55,249
my age or older it's almost guaranteed
that they're going to get this reference

167
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:59,439
in this weather funny in that regard the
other reference I use is this you have a

168
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:05,248
website too fast or discard but you
can't really do anything if you can

169
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:08,809
actually have people get to your site or
you can execute on their orders or

170
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:16,290
whatever happens to be that your company
email from the data that we have on our

171
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,779
platform we pull out all the different
types of attacks on a quarterly basis

172
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,360
and we provide this for free to everyone
so use it for whatever purpose as you

173
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,240
want to use it for so the latest data
that I have a publicly available at this

174
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,800
point still about a week before we
release our cute one day which is not

175
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,420
here this breaks out the various types
of the tax and the victor in frequency

176
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,860
this was actually the first quarter
that's cue for 2015 was the first

177
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,019
quarter we saw SSDP attacks dropped
precipitously every quarter before that

178
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,420
this was actually being used as a denial
service reflector by attackers why

179
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,569
because it worked that simple when you
look at all of the home routers that are

180
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:59,469
being plugged in and miss configured as
a perfect example almost all of these

181
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,740
had universal plug and play as part of
their structure STP is a component that

182
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,879
simple service discovery protocol now a
while back I wrote an article forms

183
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,720
about this where I talked about this is
being leveraged by attackers and

184
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,439
apparently there's an organization
called the Universal Plug and Play

185
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,259
consortium I didn't know this was an
actual beast but they popped out of the

186
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,259
woodwork and they sent me a very nasty
email

187
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,170
they wanted me to be they wanted me to
correct the article saying that

188
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:34,030
universal plug and play was perfectly
secure as that but data I know it's

189
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,220
secure we set so apparently they had
lost in the translation that I was

190
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,560
actually showing them raw data as
opposed to jumping up and down like my

191
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,760
hair was on fire I was actually showing
them something empirical and they still

192
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,090
wouldn't back down on it but this is
really how I look at a sneak peek at

193
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,640
this point in time is really a tool that
if it is not implemented correctly

194
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,350
security is not taken into place into
account whether this becomes a attack

195
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,740
tool now that takes into application
layer base attacks

196
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,490
these are the attack services that I
really expected attackers to be going

197
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,980
out for more and as someone who
defendants companies for a living I'm

198
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,090
happy that they're not but as someone
who sits back and say well logically why

199
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,260
are you not doing that I guess because
it's a little bit harder require some

200
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,810
level of intelligence

201
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,609
these are the attacks that I feel have
the biggest bang for the buck with a

202
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,840
dial services just doing a volumetric
attack there are all kinds of ways to

203
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,670
help mitigate that sort of attack with
Apple case basis that you want to make

204
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,319
sure that when you have controls in
place

205
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,470
resilient code has been reviewed do you
have any sort of issues in it like

206
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:50,390
sequel injection solvable problem though
it keeps popping up now when we look at

207
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:56,600
the data we go through it and each to
begin with one of the biggest pieces of

208
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,570
the puzzle but as you can see here

209
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,440
application based tax only accounted for
3% of the overall attack vol for that

210
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,690
quarter is very slightly from quarter to
quarter but the worst I've ever seen as

211
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,930
it went up to 10% knows about six months
ago and is really actually amazing that

212
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,120
we don't see more of that

213
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,750
this really interesting that when you
look at the data and when you look at

214
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,490
the data this is where I go back to
talking about the source

215
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,630
talking about raw data versus what we've
gone through massage this is actual raw

216
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,279
data and we're going through it based on
countries and I don't know if you can

217
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,920
see it on this is better than i turn my
back on the real weird little sound well

218
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:54,060
alright so when you're looking at these
sources countries for web attacks 56% of

219
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,099
the source attack on part of the
country's was united states and cue for

220
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,490
2015 and this really comes into an
interesting focus when you look at the

221
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:10,140
top target countries United States came
in at seventy-seven percent this really

222
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,120
evokes the image of Nelson from The
Simpsons just going stop hitting

223
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,839
yourself stop hitting yourself and I
don't understand why this is such a

224
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,399
prevalent problem in the united states
there could be something that I missing

225
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,020
or it's entirely possible that attackers
are just running through IP addresses

226
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,320
North America that's one of the reasons
I but I caveat that we just have the raw

227
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,970
data we have gone through that level of
granularity digging into it

228
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:40,990
yeah but what we have done to reverse
the day based on industry verticals now

229
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,559
we're looking at the various industry
verticals is really interesting to note

230
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:52,840
that retail is by far the number one
attack critical of the mall where is in

231
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,720
years gone by

232
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,630
finance was definitely the number one
and when people are attacking financed

233
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,630
directly after financial data records
credit card numbers all the rest of it

234
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,470
and as financial institutions got better
as securing their platforms fewer and

235
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,980
fewer people were going after these
platforms because I said ok it's getting

236
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,000
harder and harder I have to go after
something a little bit easier

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,770
who has the same kind of data and is not
nearly up to snuff that we're seeing

238
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,860
with financial institutions retail

239
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,219
attackers are becoming after retail and
more and more as well going after hotels

240
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:32,200
in various places and a perfect example
of this there was a hotel booking site

241
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,540
in Europe roughly a year maybe two years
ago called elephant hippo hippo this

242
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,240
site was really interesting because you
could actually increment there is a

243
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,600
unique identifier in the URL if you
changed it

244
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,949
factor of 10 per down you get somebody
else's booking details and rather than

245
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,679
fix the problem when it came to light
the company just went out of business

246
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,460
so when you're looking at these sort of
things you have to understand that

247
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,250
you're not doing a good job of securing
your own platform you can go out of

248
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,080
business like that and this was a great
example of that and I may be getting the

249
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,689
name wrong but I do something to that
effect and when the attackers are going

250
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,070
after the sort of financial data and
they can't get it they can always flip

251
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,260
to a different method now one of the
really interesting methods and around

252
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,940
for quite some time but it really risen
apartments in last year's extortion base

253
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,210
attacks

254
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,530
these are the folks that will come after
you and say your site with X amount of

255
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,049
data sent you an email saying we're
going to attack you hears evidence and

256
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:37,760
your logs pay up or going to knock you
off the internet and they didn't go

257
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,100
after quite a few sites in 2014

258
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,250
there were documented such a steely meet
up and base camp and the interesting

259
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,850
thing is when ever they made their
extortion demands of the ransom demands

260
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,889
for these particular attacks it was very
low was always in Bitcoin and always

261
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,890
amounted to somewhere between 80 and
$150 urs

262
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,600
really struck me as odd and as we went
through the look at the natural

263
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,030
progression of things we realized that
this was an organization of trying out

264
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,710
the new monster and they became known as
the day for BC whether by their own

265
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,750
monitor our I don't remember how the
doctor came into being but these were

266
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,870
folks that would attack sites for money
and unfortunately a lot of folks that

267
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,559
didn't happen

268
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,790
protections in place actually did pay
the ransom and the problem that I see

269
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:29,770
here is that in so doing they managed to
create a precedent by creating that

270
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,418
president ok we'll talk more sites and
as this sort of information found its

271
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,720
way into the media all the sudden you
have copycat

272
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,280
example of an email and unfortunately
fairly certain nobody can read that from

273
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,149
that particular screens Audrey totter it
says allow us to introduce ourselves

274
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,460
first they would put three different
articles and it was this would vary from

275
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,179
email to email for news sites and saying
this is describing who we are or just

276
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:05,809
google tv for pc they've gotten to that
point where they had gotten so sure of

277
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:10,668
themselves that they were willing to say
you see how it is and if you don't pay

278
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,309
us 30 bit point we're going to attack
you this is not a legitimate actual

279
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:17,280
email that went to one of our customers
who was protected so they didn't have a

280
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,590
problem but the email really resonated
with me because what if your mom and pop

281
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,649
shoppers small-medium business that
running it doesn't have any sort of

282
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:30,450
protections in place this could be the
end of you theoretically now more

283
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,070
recently these attackers this particular
group has sort of gone to ground a bit

284
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,678
but they were claiming between 400 and
500 gigabytes of traffic is their attack

285
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,020
platform the reality of it was more
around the lines of just under 50

286
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,309
gigabytes but that in itself can still
enough to take out quite a lot of sites

287
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:53,450
but they didn't end well for one of the
key members of the group who just this

288
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,730
past January or December the little bit
fuzzy on the dates with actually

289
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:04,919
captured by your pool and is now cooling
his heels in a prison and the really

290
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,220
interesting thing is that a lot of
people were like yeah we got one that's

291
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,559
gonna be the end of the knocks this is
just the start because they see yes they

292
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,670
got caught the attacker to learn how
they got caught

293
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,520
and they adapt and move on as one of
things that we collectively need to do a

294
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,060
better job of isn't learning from our
own mistakes learning from her own past

295
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,010
data and saying how can we do a better
job of this the attackers do a great job

296
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,290
with this so now we see more
organizations popping up there doing the

297
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,840
same sort of thing but they're getting
better at keeping the military even to

298
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,530
the point where we saw one particular
group Armada collective which would

299
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,899
threaten but more often not they
wouldn't launch an attack and then an

300
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,740
immediate just a couple weeks ago it
came out that they actually never

301
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,590
attacked anybody of any size or shape
but people would pay up anyway they made

302
00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:00,199
about $100,000 just by threatening
companies not tell me that is not

303
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,950
incentive for somebody living in the
former East Bloc country that sit around

304
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,680
at home and figure out how they're gonna
make a career for themselves who we got

305
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,950
method we got most we got opportunity

306
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:20,930
wow I haven't

307
00:23:43,200 --> 00:24:07,230
hospitals with the ransomware that we
saw in California unfortunately they

308
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:18,490
paid the ransom and just northeast of
make a point to look that up and that's

309
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,720
a perfect example of just because you're
attached the internet you become target

310
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,510
uncertainty and doubt it's that you have
a number associated with your

311
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,870
organization and what are the Tigers
doing they're winding through the IP

312
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,989
address blocks and eventually going to
get to you and when they do they're

313
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,279
gonna want any sort of empathy attack
and this is the easiest one and also the

314
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,830
most prevalent one was talking about
earlier and a lot of this is wrapped

315
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:46,769
around NDP SNMP DNS biggest
amplification attacks and a lot of this

316
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:52,220
is our own fault as defenders why do I
say that because for example NTP if it

317
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,139
is not updated to create your name is
not updated the current it is

318
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:58,928
potentially a reflector if you asked him
he is not updated to current is

319
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:05,260
potentially a DNS misconfigured same
problem and as we can see going from the

320
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,299
right side of the screen from the top to
the bottom it's quarter over quarter we

321
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,908
can see the amount of the volumetric
based attacks is increasing as we go

322
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:19,750
along and it is just getting easier and
easier for attackers to launch these

323
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,039
things because we haven't been
exercising proper website hygiene or

324
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:29,100
proper system hygiene in general they're
leveraging on our mistakes how long does

325
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,399
it until somebody says we'll wait a
minute you didn't properly configure

326
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:38,969
systems you are part of the attack so
you're in cyber insurance is now pull

327
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,260
not there yet but it's possible scenario
so why are these attacks launched

328
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:51,730
getting bigger and bigger a lot of the
what I see is the barrier to entry is

329
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,350
dropping

330
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,750
it is getting so simple tools I'm gonna
show you here are admittedly a couple

331
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,750
years old but you get the point across

332
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,820
haven't just as a great little tool for
doing sequined action has set up a lab

333
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,600
in my office and I use this tool couple
years ago it was frightening how buddy

334
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,879
simple this is click link next time you
have Papa system and you know that

335
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,760
uncomfortable moment when you realize
your slides are out of order

336
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,360
awesome anyway so I'm not going to talk
about don't don't add another example of

337
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,889
a slide sorry tool that is literally you
put in the site you want to hit you hit

338
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,789
the pickup or and goal and that was how
simple it was now this year is and i

339
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:40,450
chart that shows the requests coming
across the wire and this is the type of

340
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,030
information that you would see as a
defender in your logs is very simple

341
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,870
there's really nothing here to
distinguish it as being that particular

342
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:52,549
tool other than the absolute volume of
the attacks so apologies for missing on

343
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,090
screen

344
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,770
tools that that make it as easy as well
as for example is held this was from

345
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,490
2012 so it's a few years old but the
reason I love putting this one year

346
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,530
because of the name is the HTTP
unbearable load King which wasn't

347
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,030
exactly all that unbearable but again
this was very similar to the donut and

348
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,820
again it was based on HTTP get requests
and again we see the type of information

349
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,539
that would come into your logs this
isn't all that different from a normal

350
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,270
web request in a lot of ways and as
you're going through it you're looking

351
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,309
at this is simply based on the volume so
you have to adapt how you're actually

352
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,649
detecting these sort of things because
the tools are getting simpler and

353
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,360
simpler case in point we all know that
somebody in here not familiar with this

354
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,129
one as the low orbit ion cannon this
would put out by one of the anonymous

355
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,650
groups at some point few years ago and
it was crowdsourcing the denial of

356
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,450
service attack and going back to
disposable workforce it was using that

357
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,190
disposable workforce to do their dirty
work for them they would each get one of

358
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,840
these tools they launched an assigned
date they would offer them up and all

359
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,149
pointed at Target and go attack

360
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,330
the problem here is this still did
absolutely nothing to obfuscate the

361
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,840
point of origin so a lot of folks got
themselves a lot of trouble on Forsman

362
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,730
because they had fired up this tool and
they were under the age of 18 and a lot

363
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:19,020
of cases and so prices they didn't end
well for a lot of them but you can see

364
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,670
that this one has a lot of configuration
options but later on we got the higher

365
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,400
than given credit for the names they're
pretty amusing but in this particular

366
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,490
case they've actually reduced the amount
of configuration needed down to a button

367
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,500
that is firing lasers they can configure
that's what different types of what they

368
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,800
call blaster packs

369
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,350
booster packs which would change the
type attack type and again you have a

370
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:50,669
crowd-sourced denial of service attack
but at no point of somebody saying to

371
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,680
these kids really should look at a
better way of doing things that this is

372
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,330
why this is a bad thing because you
could get yourself in some serious

373
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,350
trouble if you can just get online
Google you can be attacking a site in

374
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,790
mere minutes that's really unfortunately
a look at it from that perspective one

375
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,620
of the really interesting tool that I've
seen through my work is dealing with

376
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,600
robots and robot of the talking before
with the al-qassam cyber fighters this

377
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,629
was an excellent tool that was built
using compromise WordPress installations

378
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,310
and we all know how secure wear dresses
I've been running a wordpress site for

379
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:28,310
over a decade and own the headaches it's
given me this tool was very good

380
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,980
launching I'll service attacks and when
they would launch them there were fears

381
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,960
there was a lot of notes and I still for
all intents and purposes is still out

382
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,320
there although it's not being leveraged
by attackers at this point I'm a matter

383
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,230
of time before somebody actually gets
gets a little now the flip it on its

384
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,010
head one of things that drive me crazy
is when the media gets a hold of a tool

385
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,300
and says this is an attack tool and then
all the sudden you have talking heads

386
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,300
and various government saying this is
tackled we should ban it

387
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,490
this is actually a case that actually
happened a couple years ago where they

388
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,800
were going on about how W get within a
hacker tool and should be taken away

389
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,430
it's not it's very much like a hammer I
can build a house or going back to you

390
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,340
about the head and neck with it it
doesn't change the fact that a hammer

391
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,740
but the thing is you have to look at the
intent of the intent and this is why

392
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,300
worry about if people are going to
legislate all these tools into criminal

393
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,050
existence are ever going to get anything
done with all the attackers pretty sure

394
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:29,680
they can now as we go through all the
data it's really interesting to see all

395
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,780
the different types of trends that we
see a developing out of this data and

396
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,160
we've only just begun

397
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,260
we've been doing this for about a couple
of years now and we really only struck

398
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,100
the start of the scratch the surface on
the volume of data we have available to

399
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,370
us so hoping to be able to provide
better reports going forward which again

400
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,520
if read everybody can talk about that
more little bit one of the things that

401
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,639
really jumped out was the media
grandstanding that was being done by

402
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,770
various attackers case in point lizard
squad they were very good at getting

403
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:05,010
themselves arrested there was one case
where to the folks that I'd

404
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,270
self-identified as being part of the
lizard didn't interview where they were

405
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,150
doing an interview with either British
or Australian television media their

406
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,340
faces were blurred but at no point that
occurred to them that this was an

407
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,209
incredibly bad idea

408
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,040
the face and say they were incarcerated
soon after this and this is something

409
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,870
that we see more and more if you look
back in the days you know the early days

410
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,899
of attrition all day and age and things
like that people with compromised sites

411
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,340
because they could there was a young
priest to my peeps and all that sort of

412
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,659
thing it would put it up on a screen
capture it whatever happened to be there

413
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,950
was no motivation other than the hey
look at me factor now there is a lot of

414
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,210
money to be made and the grant standards
like to make a lot of noise because

415
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,800
there's money to be made for them as
well and that comes in the form of the

416
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,040
commoditization is denial of service

417
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,850
bit of a mouthful but when you look back
to all of those platforms over doing

418
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,929
simple site discovery protocol that were
usually being added as denial of service

419
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:09,300
tools these and other types of nodes
across the Internet can be conscripted

420
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,509
into botnets

421
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:17,469
these botnets can then be harvested into
a platform where they can actually sell

422
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:21,719
services to an end user can be an
attacker so rather than downloading it

423
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:26,209
to launching it you can now use the
platform now but if your goal is quad

424
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:29,570
came out with a platform which was
actually built on another group's

425
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,439
software called titanium going or
titanium and titanium crews platform

426
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,919
they got there so I got this offer from
them how don't know it was given to them

427
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,469
purloined whatever that may be but when
they first set it up they set it up so

428
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:45,099
badly that we were able to download all
of the users and the unique identifiers

429
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,159
they didn't even figure out how to put
it she access files on it so they're

430
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,519
very good at getting in front cameras
but they were not doing a very good job

431
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,499
of securing their own platform but the
part of it that really got me was how

432
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:01,949
they would break it out this is an
actual screen shot from the lizard

433
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:06,159
strasser platform that they put up and
it gives you the various packages

434
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,729
unfortunately I probably can't read it
but I'll tell you the one in the bottom

435
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:15,979
right corner here is 7200 seconds for
$69.99 a month or two hundred and eighty

436
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:20,389
lifetime but with a platform like this I
wouldn't go into the lifetime helen hunt

437
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:26,569
now with this particular deal if you
take $69.99 divided by 30 per month when

438
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:31,289
you're looking at $2.33 day put that in
context

439
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:42,309
coffee drinkers I know now look at a
Starbucks americano Grande $2.55 for

440
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:46,359
less than a cup of coffee a day you
gonna knock and sites offline using this

441
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,999
cloud-based platform really amazing to
think how things have come now something

442
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,440
somebody pointed out to me when I get
this talk and interrupt this year

443
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,279
what if they're actually onto a business
model admittedly these sort of platforms

444
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,569
did exist back in the nineties where you
can actually do load testing on your

445
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:07,649
sites and use wanted one of the
financial institutions that was but it

446
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:11,509
wasn't meant as an attack tool now these
folks are using all kinds of interesting

447
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:17,539
language to cover that up to one of the
things that these platforms use is a

448
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:20,770
bitter and a bitter is actually born out
of the gaming platforms

449
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,040
and if you have somebody that you're
angry at because they're getting a

450
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,699
higher score you could actually use this
particular tool Twitter type of tool to

451
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,770
knock them off and it's really
interesting that in addition to that it

452
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:37,120
would end up taking out other people it
was really an annoying piece that as you

453
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,139
progressed you also found a spot for
granting stressors which goes back to

454
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,649
what I was talking about a moment ago
where these are legitimate by foreign

455
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:47,399
back in the nineties but now as it
actually calling the stressor because

456
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,469
it's illegal artifact and by calling it
that they're going back to the days in

457
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,158
the nineties where these were actual
platform that reused and say oh we're

458
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,710
just giving the platform we're not
actually doing the attack and I would

459
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:04,290
say that this is they should really seek
actual professional legal help because

460
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,750
this is not the way it works oh and
there's all kinds of these platforms out

461
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,230
there this is just a sample list and
this is by no means an endorsement of

462
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,180
any of them in any way shape or form but
as you go through the list one of the

463
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,210
ones that really caught my eye was the
Big Bang better watch it because it made

464
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:26,560
me giggle so these five forms you can
pay for all of them to use them to tack

465
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,360
wherever you see fit but Big Bang bitter
what we're doing our research my

466
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,120
coworker and I found a video of this
works

467
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:41,860
yes this is a remarkable video in that
it goes through and it provides all

468
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,880
kinds of information about their
platform that provides about the types

469
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,510
of attacks and see if I can do this
without setting off the speaker

470
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:09,890
custom source goes through to you can
hit like a boss

471
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:17,109
there's a reason I'm writing this run
for a second has a piece about a minute

472
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,600
in that actually cracked me up to no end

473
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,770
not this but this is funny untraceable
servers and we all know how that works

474
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:31,200
on the internet a different types of
attack methods call now karen is 24 so I

475
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,089
seven friendly support this is how I
days they've become and then I really

476
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,140
thought back to what the person
interrupt enemy that are they on for

477
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,450
business model they may well be actually
there could be some legitimacy as you

478
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,899
look at bug bounty program today

479
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,700
bug bounty programs are legitimate two
years ago that would not have been too

480
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,660
low and some other highlights I'm going
to drive him crazy I'm gonna wander

481
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,240
around and going through this we're
looking at the different types of things

482
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,779
we're seeing a lot of psychological
index contacts and more and more of

483
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,580
these attackers are going out of their
way to build out their platforms so that

484
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,460
they can offer these services and one of
the biggest problem that we saw our data

485
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,430
breaches fueling further attacks and
when I say that we see all of these user

486
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,100
names will see all of these accounts
that are getting dumped out and then

487
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,740
being run against other sites in hopes
of breaking into Amazon Apple whatever

488
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,990
happens to be so they can actually take
a gift cards in your name things like

489
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,990
that and make some money

490
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,930
alright so attribution and something
that I have a huge problem with

491
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,440
especially when you look at the whole
north korea Sony Pictures think I really

492
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,530
have a deep and abiding suspicion about
that one but that's a whole nother

493
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,830
ballgame so when we present the data

494
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,520
sorry when I presented in this
particular case it is just raw data

495
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,759
there is no effort to go through and

496
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:06,170
vilify any particular character so now
before us talking about top 10 sources

497
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,360
for webOS attacks this is top 10 sources
for DDoS attacks and primarily based on

498
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,730
volumetric attacks against
infrastructure and go figure

499
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,630
China came in at number one but this was
a really interesting departure this

500
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,790
particular quarter because turkey jumped
to 22 percent of the overall tax and

501
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:28,100
this coincided strangely enough with the
downing of the russian fighter jet in

502
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,230
Syria so we don't know if this was a
relation but it was an interesting

503
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,010
correlation when you look at the time
stamps and they almost reflected exactly

504
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,140
based on the source and when we see the
types of attacks that come across our

505
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,950
platform this is a perfect example of
one attacker against one of our

506
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,850
customers and they were alternating
their attacks alternating their attack

507
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,500
Muslims over the course of the month of
december trying to get through and

508
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,440
trying to knock down the site and it
really shows that these these particular

509
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,010
this particular attacker went up to over
three hundred and ninety bits per second

510
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:07,400
on one particular day december thirtieth
did not end well for them this year we

511
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,150
look at the frequency attacks based on
the industry and we look at the

512
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:16,400
frequency gaming this is our number one
there's a lot of pissed off teenagers

513
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,940
with access to the internet and as we go
through these we look at the DDoS

514
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,010
attacks as a function of time if we go
back to queue for 2013 up to queue for

515
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:31,930
2015 and then we put them out based on
the number and the volume going from

516
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:39,049
left or right to left after a new day
you'll notice one thing is really caught

517
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,030
my attention is that it goes from the
lights back on all the way over to a

518
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,030
darker smudge on this site and it's not
too much of a stretch to think that in a

519
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,570
couple of years I just gonna be a solid
black bar at the rate we're going

520
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,290
because the number of these attacks is
increasing quarter over quarter and it

521
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:58,600
really shows that you know it's getting
easier and easier to attack people other

522
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,450
innovations I go back to this over and
over again

523
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,118
single injection this is a solvable
problem

524
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,210
and we're going through this will look
at the different types of things

525
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,039
malicious file uploads job I think
general election one of the most

526
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:16,109
maligned miss marketed things in the
world it is an excellent remote access

527
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:21,680
market lost and single injection like
we're talking about earlier

528
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,299
has been around for over a decade the
least documented over a decade and this

529
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,920
doesn't have to be the case it just
won't die and I don't know why

530
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,249
and the reason that I have a real
problem with this and as we all should

531
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:38,038
it's because it ends up badly for the
people getting attack this is data

532
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,559
actually pulled from recycled data is
beautiful and graphical representation

533
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,559
of attacks over the last part of let

534
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:52,350
last year that's a lot of records that
have been pop because of various reasons

535
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,390
they're not all signaling their base
attacks but the good part of them and

536
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,920
when we're looking at these types of
attacks and going through them we also

537
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,530
look at remote remote file inclusion and
one of the things that we found was this

538
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,090
thing here there was a slider slider
there was a wordpress plugin called red

539
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,160
slider and regular if you ever been to a
wordpress site where you see the images

540
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,670
changing randomly this is one of those
plugins I could do that and it they had

541
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,800
a sequel injection problem that allowed
for this sort of attack where that you

542
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,100
would have a shell on a WordPress
installation where you can leverage

543
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:29,000
other types of attacks continued in
itself but when you look at it this is

544
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,350
the kind of thing that the attackers
were using to get into these systems

545
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,360
look at the CD days up here

546
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,300
2009 2012 2008 this is data from last
year

547
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,250
these are old problems that should have
been fixed but we're still stuck

548
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:50,080
cleaning up the mess now if we're not
doing good website hygiene we really run

549
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,690
the risk of becoming part of an undead
army we have all of our systems that

550
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,500
were responsible for but if we're not
paying attention

551
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,510
we're not doing the most you know I'm
glamorous thing of looking at log files

552
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,630
were gonna miss these sort of things and
we're gonna become part of the problem

553
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:11,350
so what can you do that first line of
course in november they can't help but

554
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,810
sequel injections are solvable problem
really have to go but we really have to

555
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,700
go back and look at data

556
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,129
ingress and egress and make sure that
we're not allowing this to happen we

557
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,600
need to do a better job of hardening
their systems for example the trap the

558
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,810
travel site that was talking about
earlier we're able to increment based on

559
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,529
the record that shouldn't happen if it
was tested properly that never would

560
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:38,410
have happened with your ISP's if you
have a site that is not currently in the

561
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,089
cloud you're still doing a traditional
hub-and-spoke architecture the ISP is

562
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:46,090
your next hop up a lot of cases they may
have medications that they can help you

563
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,240
with your ideas help you better secure
systems and most importantly of all

564
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,149
catch your systems this is by far the
leading big problem that I see it there

565
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,059
is people don't do a good job of this
people love

566
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:04,509
fascinated with a zero-day attack this
is a problem oh my god it's this is that

567
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:07,509
but what about the patches you didn't
apply from six months ago

568
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,739
Oracle patches perfect example and we're
going through this we look at these

569
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,650
stories about 20 days a week a whole wow
but then the data goes has to come in

570
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,380
and say no stop that we really have to
look at the information a lot of these

571
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,489
attacks were happening the successful
ones based on deprecated systems that

572
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:31,039
aren't properly passed or whatever
happened to be we need to do a better

573
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,559
job as defenders now all of this data
that i've been pulling hear a lot of

574
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,729
this data that point from is actually
available that we make it freely

575
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:41,209
available to everyone to read it

576
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:45,279
interstate of the internet report which
comes out every quarter and a lot of

577
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,910
this information is available because of
a lot of my coworkers at work in their

578
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,828
search team and various other research
functions within Akamai and there's a

579
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,529
t-shirt that they were giving out Miami
last week so I couldn't resist but throw

580
00:43:57,529 --> 00:44:00,369
