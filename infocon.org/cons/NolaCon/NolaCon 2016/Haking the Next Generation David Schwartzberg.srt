1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,350
so thank you joining today this is
called hacking the next generation of

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,080
cyber frontier could control myself very
brief

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,349
my name's David Schwartz Berg I work for
MobileIron

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,130
as a senior security engineer and a part
of the MobileIron security lab so the

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:25,448
acronym of SL is affectionately
pronounced missile is a pretty woman who

6
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:32,480
just called missile I'm also the
president of her kids not for profit and

7
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,910
that's all I'm gonna say about me but
this is a little bit of you got the card

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,980
with the facepalm kind of embarrassed
that we've been with this way with the

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,010
Star Trek me but you're not gonna see
too many other references and angry

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:58,170
angry writer doesn't like that word very
much so much generation of users will

11
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,710
call her childhood that if you wanna do
anything with technology it was a lot of

12
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,340
restrictions and these restrictions were
really kind of age babies because if you

13
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,619
were here nine years ol right then and
there is cause depending on what level

14
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,920
you are could've been reading there's
also the other restriction of typing

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,590
right you need to know how to use a
keyboard and a lot of patience but now

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,210
through things like mobility and
consumerization of int today's

17
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,350
generation of kids they don't have these
restrictions at all

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:02:04,250
ok yeah yeah it's ok to share bathroom
people so a couple years ago my son they

19
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,930
are many he really didn't speak very
much at a young age he understood

20
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,810
everything but he didn't worry very well
but when he started to speak to one of

21
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,500
the first things he started saying

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,190
passcode is very detached and he still
is to establish now fast-forward couple

23
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,560
years it took us some time and now he
says is passed out in his head

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,280
were thankful for but we haven't changed
it yet so everyone on the internet knows

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,850
how to break into his tablet but this is
kinda really part of the point is kids

26
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:48,260
are wired to learn and if you give them
an environment where they can play while

27
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,480
they learn you're going to see better
results and that's really the reason why

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,619
we created hack for kids for kids is
essentially an environment where kids

29
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,200
can go and learn about Internet safety
practices explore things like science

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,470
and technology in a safe environment and
if you feel that it's our responsibility

31
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:19,650
to teach this generation of computing
users these best practices and we have a

32
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:31,750
lot in common so when did have two kids
come about due back in 2013 thank you

33
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,160
kind of proceeding before that but this
this was really the catalyst back in

34
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,109
2013 I thought we'd including four
different people that wanted to start

35
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,030
fuck on

36
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,330
thought was really pretty cool as I've
been going to talk on since the first

37
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,860
one and operate a volunteer is the
better year for this one

38
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:59,370
and I love that event and inside of me
has been kind of burning ember to want

39
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,460
to deliver some kind of conference to
bring people together but there was a

40
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,230
talk on chicago's really didn't make
sense to have another event there and in

41
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,760
so doing something activities that I do
creating a children's book on technology

42
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,310
and just working with Cub Scouts and my
kid asking me kind of computing question

43
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,130
it's starting to make sense of this was
really kind of the direction to go and

44
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,320
you can other people but to me and said
you know you're really that kind of a

45
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,719
person who should really be leading this
effort in this mission to get these kids

46
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,250
trained at a younger age because they're
still entrenched in technology now

47
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,770
they're not getting a lot of the best
practices from their schools or even

48
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,270
some of their parents what we did to
these guys and I was thrilled when they

49
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,169
replied and said yeah we'll have you on
the team will be the fifth person being

50
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,039
an organizer and now I kinda felt like
that fire members being abandoned its

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,370
kind of burning inside and then some
about a month or month-and-a-half leader

52
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,240
the thought con Board of Directors
decided that they didn't want to get

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,490
into a kids event and that kind of
really over you know the whole team does

54
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,740
that you know maybe come up with
something else so that fire fell back

55
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:28,640
down to a little bit of a spark and I
just carried on deciding you know do

56
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,440
this on my own

57
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,270
just a different direction you know what
are we gonna do and then just kinda

58
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,659
talking to some of the people that I
reached out to the other four

59
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,060
individuals just to get to make sure
that it was ok with them but they prove

60
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,740
that I can go and do this on my own I
got a bunch of people to help me in 2014

61
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,610
we created a person expertise in chicago
which was really pretty exciting and fun

62
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,400
I love this picture because you could
see like one of the staff members on the

63
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,539
right you know looking down at his phone
not really paying attention to the

64
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,260
opening

65
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,840
Sherman but we we have a like a really
light hearted group of people we work

66
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,340
well together because we treat each
other like family right we we love one

67
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,369
another so that means we pick on each
other and part of that keep this going

68
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:18,710
forward but he was the first event and
there's some other pictures so there's

69
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,510
my son again he was we had some
gentleman from mid Illinois he did from

70
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,750
home in half in the homebrew hacksaw and
this is what we created this rollout of

71
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,180
the garbage can and galvanized pail he
put some wheels on it was powered by

72
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,410
Arduino and some wifi controllers and
was really pretty cool in the cowboy hat

73
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,350
was really just hide some of the the
wires are the antenna that was sticking

74
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,130
out the front with a tablet with our
website there's my son he looked at this

75
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,670
mechanical beast and it's bigger than
him so he's like a little intimidated

76
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,669
that we seem freezing in his tracks that
I don't know if you could see but a

77
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:02,550
little bit on the side of the road but
there's a clear and in the mail and

78
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:09,040
overcame his fear he hadn't said he was
motivated and really that's kind of

79
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,440
interesting is when I was a youth who
played Dungeons and Dragons here are

80
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,580
still does but I didn't wish I could I
used to spend a lot of time memorizing

81
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,620
these complex matrices and tables
because it would make the game played

82
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,780
better this incentive and it's really
kind of what we do it happen we find the

83
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,609
incentive for the kids to motivate them
to want to learn and a big part of our

84
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,780
incentives are prices we have this
competitive with me we had this

85
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,890
participatory CT yet whereas the kids go
through the different stations and you

86
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:50,060
learn more about that soon the more the
more involved again the more punches the

87
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,400
recognition they get on a little
business card and the more chances they

88
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,870
have to win a prize and we found that to
be very very effective so there's been

89
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,310
any

90
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,230
one of the things that we do is we
introduce electronics right foundation

91
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,020
of a lot of technology and who were
members of the old crystal radio set

92
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,280
with the little springs in the wires and
had to stick him in there and connected

93
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,469
to another wire and it would work for a
period of time and there were a lot of

94
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:23,030
fun with the heat get little soldering
but these are snapped circuit with you

95
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,219
could raise your hand if you played with
snap it really hi there are a lot of fun

96
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,130
but there really is something which cost
prohibitive the cheapest settle things

97
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,880
like 60 bucks and fortunately the
company a link oh they're based out of

98
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,970
Wheeling Illinois which is really like
the next town over for me I visited

99
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,190
their warehouse and it's really pretty
cool that really nice place to go if

100
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,930
you're into electronics and soldering
and whatnot put the donated a bunch of

101
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,469
kids stuff so that the kids can then use
these kids and we gave some away as

102
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,990
prizes so one of the prizes width 500
project which retail then was about a

103
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,090
hundred and seventy-five which is a
really nice price for people with the

104
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,100
kids are they are the kids play with
only given budget challenges we educate

105
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,460
them a bit on electronics

106
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,790
leaping forward a little bit we had some
windows and these are just a bunch of

107
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,439
Arduino since and custom hacker kids 3d
printed cases and the story behind this

108
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,280
one was my eldest son Sam as I can't let
me show you this link with an Arduino

109
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:29,829
and had a plugged in the blinky lights
at school but can you make it more I

110
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,070
love it down and it was new to me I was
it uses the language so we went there

111
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,240
and we figured it out and we started to
get it to blanket different durations

112
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,240
look at this is the day that works fine
I will just trying to like the letter S

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
and we went through all the different
command I think that's kind of long and

114
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,810
difficult to follow how do we know that
the letter what we come up with some

115
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,380
kind of function that does and we can
just readers dot dot dot and if you know

116
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,630
Morse code that's fine

117
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,570
international so you know Morse code you
can go through it

118
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,450
good but then as we started to introduce
oh and then again

119
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm like this is getting harder to read
what do you think we can do is like

120
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,410
let's make another function like what do
you think we should make one for ethnic

121
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,290
140 sure so we were starting to do

122
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,910
function calls which I thought was
pretty cool its back then he was nine

123
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,730
and he's going through this and any
understanding it is we're doing and just

124
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,480
building upon layers and by the end we
had functions

125
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,370
every letter in the English alphabet
calling dr dre beats them whenever the

126
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:40,190
more sequences and then when you look at
it it was readable so then we integrate

127
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,410
that into hacker kids at the scavenger
hunt is one of his friends came to me is

128
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,060
it gonna do scavenger hunt this year cuz
that would really cool sure

129
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,439
printed up a bunch of these different
cases had scorecard and different

130
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,110
challenges and had the difference
between those blinking the answer so

131
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,220
they found the Arduino they figured out
the more we had the answer but then they

132
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,510
have to look at the store cart to see
where that map so they could fill it out

133
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,000
but little did they know if they peel
the cover off the number for the answer

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,880
was right inside the wanted to try to
introduce the hacker mindset of you know

135
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,870
voiding warranty right we peel off the
sticker label we don't really doesn't

136
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:28,430
stop us and that we just were probably
afraid to break it on the other one

137
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,410
thing that I did with my son with these
was instead of having like some kind of

138
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,030
external power source and trying to find
a place at the venue what we plug it in

139
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:43,010
we meet some nine volt wiring casings
and we started them up and a connector

140
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:48,520
in just had a little nine volt battery
and not the good work which was really

141
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,470
nice seeing a lot of people learn from
that

142
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,470
here there's a young lady that our
technology destruction village who here

143
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,220
as a kid love things apart to their
parents agree and I think everybody

144
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,220
raised their participation

145
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,920
participation so you know when I was a I
remember my parents having this TV that

146
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,740
was the size of a piece of furniture in
these days and turn the TV on and it's

147
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,870
like you know what it looks like inside
to get out the flathead screwdriver and

148
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,950
removing the screws and I look inside
and it's all these two touch gonna be

149
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:37,640
alright cool down then I started taking
him out looking at it was like oh my god

150
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,269
this is have to go back in the same
exact way I don't know anything of this

151
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,029
dick I mean I was like what are they
gonna get in trouble they put it back in

152
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:49,870
the right way and want to turn it was
warmer no not transformers and transfer

153
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,060
to and that was kind of my first
exploratory moment it's what I could do

154
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,630
I think it shop fortunately but it was
no adult supervision

155
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,019
my parents around but they didn't know
what I was doing and that's kind of what

156
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:09,170
we want to introduce into her kids give
kids the freedom to take things apart

157
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,010
without feeling like they're getting in
trouble

158
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,750
to give them the ability to explore the
components and not have to worry about

159
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,970
putting it back together and you could
see she's taking apart the DSL modem

160
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,790
with no care in the world about what her
parents are gonna see it when they find

161
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,250
out and she can go and explore destroyed
but we do it also we want them to

162
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,290
identify the components so part of the
challenges in the exercises

163
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,689
resistors capacitors what is this what
is that and then they get recognition

164
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,800
for that during the participatory CGS
sounds like fun right so what is

165
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,899
happening we are a registered 501 C
three with bu s government IRS so that

166
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,540
gives us certain benefits from being
able to ask for donations and stuck with

167
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,630
organizations and corporations tend to
open their purses a little wider

168
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,189
sometimes for a charity rather than
someone doing it for profit but it also

169
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,019
introduces other bureaucratic
complexities but we are a public charity

170
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,459
and we partner up with a lot of other
different conferences so we do have the

171
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,990
one thats independent in Chicago but
more specifically we found that if we

172
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,810
partnered with people like Circle City
con worker then there's going to be

173
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,000
needy parents with that mindset I T

174
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,400
looking to learn and be curious you know
when you grow up

175
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,290
families and they're going to want to
bring their kids like a lot of kids go

176
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,390
to DEFCON these days so it made sense

177
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,770
you know kind of like go good with a
couple of our that's part of what we

178
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,960
decided to do and it worked out really
well as specifically with nickel city

179
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,080
con

180
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,590
more like a village that we don't need
to worry so much about venue and all

181
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,620
those other logistical items that come
up we really kind of get the focus on

182
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,650
content and attendance in keeping the
kids safe and given them a lot of

183
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,420
activities to be fun so last year with
her here working on this year june 11

184
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,670
gonna be in Indianapolis will be there

185
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,000
bring your kids I think you could still
register with Circle City and the kids

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,950
are free to help subsidize a lot of a
cost which is really nice models well we

187
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,940
went across the pond and we're working
with the folks over Bruc on those people

188
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,160
over there they're phenomenal who work
with their hands are really polite just

189
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,550
like comedian I know there's at least
one Canadian in the room today and one

190
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,620
of the great things about buchanan's we
went there be covered a lot of our costs

191
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,360
begin as a charity it's kind of hard to
get money for people and then we do

192
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,220
we're very careful how we want to spend
it we want to give that much back to the

193
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,090
kids so going into flying and bringing
all that equipment over they help pay

194
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,910
for that they gave a speech to youth and
we had a good number twenty four kids

195
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:09,100
would like minimal promotion of it they
just contacted the regular Phukan and

196
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,050
he's and staff and it was phenomenal

197
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:18,729
that was actually our first event we
ever deliver in any language other than

198
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,530
English and it wasn't three languages so
Englishman's their rank and file image

199
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,670
which I thought was really pretty cool
you know I'm seeing somebody's face

200
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,640
kinda scrunch up a bit but think about
it this way in the Python programming

201
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,830
workshop the educator needed to know the
language is that the kids he spoke

202
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,400
English French and Flemish had a
question in the kids native language

203
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,910
because I did know this but certain in
Belgium kids who are like younger than I

204
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,550
think it's like 11 didn't really start
learning English and you know what

205
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,540
whatever their native languages at home
and depending on weather in northern or

206
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,380
southern Belgium it could be French
Flemish so I got a nice education at

207
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,750
that but we we dominated them and had a
great time very happy to say we're doing

208
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:13,680
it again this year in in Belgium Ghent
Belgium and the folks there have really

209
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,540
kind of just taking initiative and
they're going forward in the came up

210
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,520
with a whole bunch of little things and
then they and we want to get you want to

211
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,720
call what do you think about this how do
you know what this work with this not

212
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,870
work what do you think would be involved
and that's really the kind of the model

213
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,290
we were looking for is it very difficult
to scale globally it because they have

214
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,320
limited resources but if we help break
the ice with one group of organisms

215
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,990
organizers then if they're willing to
take the initiative in cohort in to

216
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,740
YouTube it with some advice we don't
want to completely go hands off but

217
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,980
that's the ideal model and it's working
really well internationally speaking

218
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,850
very excited to announce that as of
Monday this week it's been communicated

219
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,449
publicly but I think this is going to be
the first time you get familiar with

220
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:08,690
Sektor see hang around oh we are
partnering with SEC pour CA so you want

221
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,690
to publicly thank them for all their
efforts it is a big year for secular see

222
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,650
it's a year and then there's a lot of
things going on there so being able to

223
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,840
the event right after beachside strano
which is Saturday and then we'll be

224
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,970
there on Sunday and insect or later in
the week I'm absolutely thrilled

225
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,580
changing I'm absolutely thrilled I know
people try to that then asking me for

226
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,120
years you guys gotta come around oh so
they've Lewis is here I know he's a big

227
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,699
part of it and kind of bridging that gap
you know I'm going to put him on the

228
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,080
spot you guys mind giving a quick
applause just to thank him because he

229
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,908
helped make it along with renew and the
other folks don't want to leave them out

230
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:55,740
but you know it's just some
conversations that we had in the past

231
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,799
impromptu at different conferences and
and you know it takes people in capital

232
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:11,750
so thank you and we could probably do
you know we also partner with their out

233
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,610
Grand Rapids Michigan we're partnering
this year with converge and b-sides

234
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,668
Detroit which is in July so appear

235
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,100
Grand Rapids is a little bit too much of
a drive for you and you think it's going

236
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,830
to be in that area

237
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:34,070
think about October 9 this year we've
had it in Grand Rapids Michigan person

238
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,760
here in the room but you don't have any
kid but you could still help us out

239
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:46,289
think I can trust you know we're able to
say no right now but we we we've already

240
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,360
had one year with this will be our
second year and they're kind of the

241
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,209
hybrid approach in Chicago we reach our
tickets are pretty low fee at Circle

242
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,470
City con we don't charge but we're still
applicability so it's kind of the middle

243
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,519
ground but we still are able to provide
a lot of fun and the cool thing with you

244
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,840
could buy the ticket

245
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,879
and still have a pool two day pass the
girl and you can drop your kids off with

246
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,419
us as we have security that is very
strict about parents dropping kids off

247
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:23,020
and picking them up so you could feel
very comfortable that your kids are did

248
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,158
well you're all having you know
educational moment contests in London's

249
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:37,950
so by now maybe feel like this is really
fun and exciting the guy I kinda really

250
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,490
relate to this week we do it with Google
forum about writing it down this is

251
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,299
being recorded you can check it out
later and you can you can sign up or you

252
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,220
can just email at the question

253
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,020
floral and we could talk about possibly
maybe organizing something with you in

254
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,570
your area or if you're not an organizer
and you know the organizers we can

255
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:04,399
absolutely do that so that would be a
lot of fun just let us know what you do

256
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:10,279
want to say that one of the things is
when it comes to people who volunteer

257
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:16,679
and help out we have a bit of a model
with your child protection and Safety is

258
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,080
a very big part of what we do so we
don't just let any volunteer the street

259
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,418
we're very careful that there they are
seats we give the children gun to

260
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:33,289
protect themselves that's one of my
other kids no but seriously that that

261
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:40,490
would actually went over so we we only
we only allow volunteers who neither

262
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,640
know board of directors where organizers
in the area that they'd known more than

263
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,779
bob and I've known Bob three years cuz I
met him three times at the same concrete

264
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,630
I'm so yeah he's cool it doesn't bother
with us

265
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,350
takes a lot more

266
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,539
part of that is because I'm very active
in Scouting

267
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,439
the terms counter that usually like an
adult leader and they have a lot of

268
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,950
strong training you protecting training
so that naturally kinda alluding to have

269
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,840
kids in a part of the white btw is you
never have one kid left alone with one

270
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,139
goal and it's not just because you know
there might be a situation with that

271
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,419
adult but sometimes kids do things that
are innocent but can be receiving

272
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:34,090
correctly in the adult then becomes in
question and we never want anyone

273
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,270
volunteering helping us to have to
defend their character so we have

274
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:44,539
certain rules specifically around you
know it's never one on one and if you go

275
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,780
into a restroom and there's just one kid
in their use your common sense and go

276
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,918
outside and we then going but if you
happen to be there and someone walked in

277
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,010
you know finish up and leave as quickly
as possible we also have rules like

278
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:03,490
photography control so we try and
depends on where we are in europe their

279
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,940
little bit more loose about this but
specifically the states that some

280
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,110
parents just don't want their kids on
social media and we do everything we can

281
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,990
to respect that so we do ask that you
know you're in the restroom you put your

282
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,679
phone away because even if you just
checking something really quick and it

283
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,340
might be important

284
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,250
could potentially be perceived it is
that you're photographing in the

285
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:30,419
restroom and then you'll be fine for the
couple minutes you don't need it or even

286
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,830
the direction I got some examples of the
point of view of the shot because again

287
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,178
we just don't want any volunteer off the
street we do want to make sure there's

288
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:46,520
somebody who's been properly vetted
here's an example of photographic

289
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:53,600
chapter we usually have 12 to photograph
her staff the pictures they get no shots

290
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,070
as well

291
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,840
back shot like this one is like the over
the shoulder charge so I don't know who

292
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,250
this kid is probably only like

293
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,280
the kids mom or dad family members could
recognize who this is

294
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:11,629
there's really no identifying markers of
the blonde hair and hear anyone and you

295
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,580
can see he's having fun doing some stuff
with electronics you could see there

296
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,820
there can be no you might have played
with the Morse code and if somebody was

297
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,810
going to take a picture of their child
but from the front and there's another

298
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:30,399
child in the rain we do ask them either
to change the POV or nicely politely the

299
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,230
child if they can just kind of step back
for a moment take the picture quickly

300
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:41,650
and then carry on then here's another
example I personally do know this child

301
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,210
but when you look at it

302
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:51,810
picture of you know the gender boy girl
hard to tell right here in there so

303
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,250
there and there's his dad reveals gender
but there is dad doing something with

304
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,310
him and that's the kind of photography
me what we want to show the action we

305
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:09,169
want to protect the identity we try to
create these fun patches I'm working on

306
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,060
some branches this year that would be
electronic that'd be really cool and the

307
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,070
engineers here and he's working really
hard to build these bad people and

308
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:23,070
customizable and you know that this last
year we did some 3d printing that is in

309
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,379
the fun story behind that is it would
run all night long and visits like my

310
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,770
office is in my bedroom and it probably
ran for about three months ending up

311
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:38,290
hundred the badge to my wife was really
happy with that thing bro you know the

312
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,750
story behind the bad news is I was
pretty 3d robot to have a little button

313
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,360
and then it kinda like maybe we could
put each porque and they're bigger and

314
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,719
bigger than a little loop on the top and
the venue in the glider and then that we

315
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,850
see that upside down arrow actually I
created a symbol for the kids to this is

316
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,300
their symbol of the tyro symbol you know
the definition of the word that means

317
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,330
somebody who's learning I can

318
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:08,449
but the the arrow is the symbol of the
Nordic room symbol for strength and

319
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:15,110
warrior and then the circle completes
the word Cairo but the circles

320
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,120
representing the unity within the hacker
community as well as a half-hour's never

321
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,500
earning never never ending desire to
learn right was once we figure something

322
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,130
else we push it a little further make
the train go faster

323
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:38,090
heavier load this software OS right we
keep going forward so that's their

324
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,879
symbol and was intentionally upside down
so they look at it was right side up and

325
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:50,620
only the kids had that symbol on their
badge so you might be asking yourself at

326
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,090
this point you know why talk about some
of the geography little bit but why are

327
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:02,730
kids there's other events out there and
like root for example phenomenal event

328
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,220
it was originally DEFCON kids and when I
heard about that fun kids and check it

329
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,760
out I wasn't allowed to bring us during
I did all this stuff and my kids wanted

330
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,110
to go but to be honest I really do want
to bring my eight-year-old to Vegas with

331
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,110
me for a week to go to bside Las Vegas
and black hat and DEFCON because they'd

332
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,080
be period of time he'd be bored or you
know really late at night if you've

333
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,389
never been there and there's not a lot
of hours of sleep and I just don't think

334
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,400
that would have been there for me to do
that but I know I know he's asleep to

335
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,850
roots is phenomenal and I do encourage
people to go

336
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,949
fortunately I did get it tour last year
under adult supervision because if

337
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,740
you're not accompanied with a child you
have an adult walking around with a good

338
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,840
control mechanism and they do some
really wonderful things there another

339
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,250
event that's being asked to another
event is in San Jose did

340
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,100
and that was run by be here for a number
of years but he's moved on to someone

341
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,610
else and I only have information based
on their website but it does not look

342
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:17,780
like it's going to be another one in San
Jose anytime soon so it's unfortunate

343
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,030
because they also seen photos in Queens
and stuff but they really do provide a

344
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,600
lot of also wonderful content picketed

345
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:33,050
you have in common and we know that
there is a lot more than just those two

346
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:39,300
coast so that's why we decided you know
the kind of created in Chicago where in

347
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,770
Indianapolis went to places in Michigan
this year we're across the pond at

348
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,379
Baruch on Belgium and we're also going
to be this year in Toronto which I'm

349
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,330
really excited about that is actually
one of my favorite cities vancouver is

350
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:58,179
pretty cool but I just a little too cold
for me so we are looking to reach out as

351
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,190
far as we can go i mean Eric we might be
doing a no kids no luck on next year

352
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,930
it's not really been discussed in debt
but we talked about it we might do that

353
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,460
next year

354
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,340
dallas has been asking us atlanta has
been an active has been asking us but we

355
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,639
run into the scalability problem I can
only go to so many these events here we

356
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,360
need people who know how to organize
people that can work in the leaders are

357
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,419
great leader but they don't have to
follow you were trying to really expand

358
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,260
as much as we can so if you do know
people in your area organizers have an

359
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,260
email

360
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,760
talked a lot about the background
support never really talked yet about

361
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:47,840
the book we provided the kids so we
provide primarily Chicago it's really

362
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,360
kind of the initial framework and then
it depends on where we're going and what

363
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,669
we're able to do the chicago has a
speaking for kids and adults we have no

364
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:02,070
age limitations whatsoever so if
somebody wants to see who's eighty years

365
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:08,210
old and it looks like it's a good talk
for kids or eight years old and their

366
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,550
first time presenting and they need
mentorship we provided we provide these

367
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:19,700
out of these activities to think of it
is you you go to different areas like

368
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,910
there might be something which could be
cryptography be so he said he did you

369
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,900
check out the number theory in advance
man second you get to have fun and be

370
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:35,520
like 15 or cooler we also have like stem
activities right you're not familiar

371
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,389
terms

372
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,540
technology engineering and math and I'm
also working on something with somebody

373
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,860
drunk we're going to include hacking so
we're going to try to start to rally

374
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:56,110
around expand that terminology that
acronym to be ste eight because EEE ths

375
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:05,429
really is not appropriate so there's
these stations where they can go around

376
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,560
and do something we're loading your
hands onto always going to be hands-on

377
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,510
we also provide some workshops in the
workshops give me anything from like

378
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,290
with hacking exposed that you see here
Raspberry Pi sitting here very old birth

379
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:24,320
minecraft server with kids ask me a lot
of fun we give them a Linux the AM and

380
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,929
we thought that Linux will they learn
how to set up minecraft a week you know

381
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:35,700
that was the win win the game but
they're learning and then we will

382
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,220
partner also found a team which has
recently changed their name in one of

383
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,860
the things they they

384
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,870
do the part of their cybersecurity
awareness and stuff is this safe and

385
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,799
secure online presentation which prior
you had to be a CISSP you had to go

386
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:55,929
through the background check their chain
making some changes just to get the

387
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,990
presentation now the presentation
publicly available and they're expanding

388
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:06,220
that now to include something for adults
as well as seniors and even younger kids

389
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,299
really happy to be able to be a bit of
an advisor to them for some of these

390
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:15,929
things that's mandatory all the time
that's where they learn the internet si

391
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:20,059
he visto troubling just cuz you can do
something online and it doesn't mean you

392
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,059
should write we know better they need
allure

393
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,710
digging deeper little bit need to each
of the different types of content we

394
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,820
provide this is gonna be recognized in
this is Ruben Paul he was nine providing

395
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,970
you know which was really pretty cool he
know was if you want to be an effective

396
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,350
white

397
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:46,909
you need to learn you got to the dark
side right you need to learn other black

398
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,960
hat techniques and he was really
focusing on the ethics but he made it

399
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,840
really fun with the whole Star Wars
paradigm along with Lego characters and

400
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:07,030
stuff and deliver the presentation and
then and recap with that little bar the

401
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:12,799
other thing you saw here you know going
up this challenge was really for them to

402
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,668
understand engineering and navigate
around engineering problem we gave them

403
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:27,520
twenty popsicle sticks for more of a ban
on plastic spoon and a picture of what

404
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,360
the catapult should look like with some
things kind of hit me that they had to

405
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,280
figure out the engineering challenges it
wasn't daunting but just they had to

406
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,840
come up with a way to get the stick in
there and provide enough leverage and

407
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,260
stuff like that and what we found is
some of the kids really just went often

408
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:48,210
built something slightly different and
we actually were pretty happy to see

409
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,960
that because again that's a hacker
mindset right you see a problem with the

410
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,450
way that you know it makes sense

411
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,360
and it might actually be that better
mousetrap so many kids then which we

412
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,600
didn't know was gonna happen

413
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,230
started balling up pieces of paper and
having competitions of who's accountable

414
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:10,990
further and we're like this is awesome
and they go back and they know the

415
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,810
rubber bands they put a little bit more
glue someplace where didn't seem so

416
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,480
strong that are in the mean they're
learning the whole project or product

417
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,580
management process without hearing will
be exciting boring parts of it but other

418
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,840
activity stations are voting days we did
show you saw the stems

419
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,410
nap circuit you know about spider-man it
could be something else to what robotics

420
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:38,600
we gonna do something that you don't do
about the program is based on whatever

421
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,600
be the robot has it goes into a circle
and then it's a grudge match and then

422
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,360
they just

423
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:52,170
robot and whoever wins were gonna have a
gift card for them to learn how to build

424
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:58,890
stronger building test so this is just
the sheet that we've used so you know at

425
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:04,290
the table it's not like willy nilly what
we do here we have a form it explains

426
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,980
what the project objectives are it's
playing some lessons if it's something

427
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:16,990
new to them and then even accounting
background kind of boy scout is why not

428
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,009
give these kids at their Scout a little
bit extra incentive we could see those

429
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,610
symbols like the gear symbol in the
circle if they're working on any of

430
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,040
their other achievements will extend
over program then they would also

431
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,220
received credit towards that as well so
they seem to appreciate and then we have

432
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:41,580
workshops I think of the workshops and
the activity stations time in 24 hours

433
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,740
the stations could be something where
they show up there five-ten minutes it

434
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,680
like that Raspberry Pi stuff not for me
but I really dig the Snap Circuits and I

435
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,319
could sit there all day we had to get
Circle City contused 14 he never touched

436
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,570
any kind of encoding their crippled
corners like we had about each of the

437
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,930
things that are binary encoded
hexadecimal base 64

438
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:16,149
alphabetic substitution ciphers like the
dancing man I love you

439
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:23,540
Marie married but that would have been
proposed so yeah the Star Wars languages

440
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,029
some interesting history on that but the
first movie really had no meaning when

441
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,349
you saw like show up on the sky walkers
display but somebody the language symbol

442
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:37,800
and we use that as an encoding Cyprus so
the kids have fun like Star Wars and a

443
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,780
little bit of googling and finding the
website how to decode it

444
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,180
frequency analysis which exceeds the
people do pig pen ciphers they're having

445
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,480
fun in this kid with there all day

446
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,540
decoding everything he could never done
this before but I love it and we don't

447
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,970
know if he's going to be like the next
30 ml

448
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,720
come up with some really cool algorithm
that mathematically based that everybody

449
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,700
uses every day in the ER is but you know
and that's the point is discovering

450
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,058
something that's tied them that they
didn't even know about themselves in the

451
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:14,970
world a little better but these are the
workshop their their intensive the 24

452
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,020
hours we've done stuff like really
unboxing

453
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:24,059
Raspberry Pi and it's easy to plug in
like an HDMI monitor USB keyboard but if

454
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:28,490
they go home so we had it set up with a
30 P running they had to learn how to

455
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:34,229
find their IP address based on the man
that we have the Mac like the last 4

456
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:40,460
characters written on the outside of
their adapter so they figured out with

457
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,920
their IP is and then they were able to
get on the way without having all the

458
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,589
other pieces hanging off of it so they
really learn more about networking in

459
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:56,880
the hunt stuff even though we just
assume they didn't nope I come but if

460
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,210
they did we had much more than
challenges that was very basic exercises

461
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:07,660
hello world including building list and
then drawing shapes and then we moved on

462
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,020
to challenges like

463
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:14,850
the disease hurdle to kind of get it to
spin around using a poorly and then when

464
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,830
they complete the challenge is anyone
the satisfaction of the educator at

465
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,529
least if it's too then they got like
recognition with a whole bunch and we

466
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:29,690
doing on time my running low it many
times speedup little bit we also the

467
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,190
Fibonacci series we thought maybe
there's somebody who's already been

468
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,240
doing some programming or they're
teenagers they wanted something a little

469
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,509
bit more challenging unfortunately
nobody tried that nobody was able to

470
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:45,320
sell online we have our library so if
you wanna see some content from prior

471
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,960
site I know I need to dress up a little
bit me a little bit more fun maybe more

472
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,240
CSS but for example that one right in
the middle of the Minecraft work shop

473
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,660
notes we have people still going in
there and clicking it getting the notes

474
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,290
on how to build your own minecraft
server on Linux which could also do on

475
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,180
restaurant.com

476
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:14,589
we give a thumbs up prices this is you
know elenco but this kid making $400,000

477
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,810
no start to press their a sponsor of
hours they give us seven or eight books

478
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:25,150
per event so now we're handing out books
to kids so they can further their

479
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,870
education and they get the picket so
depending on your order you get the

480
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:39,370
prize and usually bigger ticket prices
for Arduino and we both have given away

481
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:46,589
the coveted Dec darkness who knows what
this is all things are you think they're

482
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,810
really pretty cool if you go to DEFCON
you can only get these attempt on its a

483
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:57,700
socket project it also has the sketch
from their website you can figure out

484
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,390
how to activate the TV be gone and when
they told the kids would he be gone in

485
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:07,500
they all wanted it i mean this was a $20
solder kit project which the bad stuff

486
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,950
on there is a lot of fun with this was
more valuable to them because they can

487
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,180
go into Best Buy in turn TV off

488
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:26,009
versus $275 stamps are like the parents
like you know what they love it they

489
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:32,800
love the bad parts tons of stuff how do
we know where effective it's really

490
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,990
really hard but we trying to collect as
many matches we can officially anything

491
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:41,819
related to cyber just two weeks ago my
son was a victim of cyberbullying but

492
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,620
when his friends and his friends friend
online on a minecraft server and he was

493
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:51,080
defending his brothers and my son was
defending my other child younger brother

494
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,259
because his friends picking on him by
breaking his stuff and using harsh

495
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,850
language because their stifling

496
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,430
around in the next room whatever we
don't know what's going on and it was

497
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,589
really very frustrating moment for us
because we like each and he's hyperbole

498
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,390
my son became a victim of it he's been
producing so many times and even though

499
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:15,430
he knows how to defuse the bully he
still got angry because it was his

500
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,069
friend usually think of the bullies
somebody that's not your kids friend but

501
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:24,240
in this case it was punched his laptop
and destroy that which is not the best

502
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,970
way to handle the situation regardless
of your age but these are real problems

503
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:32,040
and very hard to know how successful we
are even when we're keeping the kids the

504
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:39,270
right things their emotional people just
like digging a little deeper talk more

505
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,450
about service but service is one way
that we try to collect metrics on how

506
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:50,450
successful we are and it's kinda tricky
cuz i dont give me the top 10 over there

507
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:56,580
are kids attended so I asked my oldest
son what you think that means your kids

508
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,150
when I asked my wife

509
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,539
she read it is how many people are gonna
happen so the wording is very important

510
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:07,859
on a survey is we had people even though
it says one two and three to circle the

511
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,170
road in the number for now it wasn't an
option

512
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:17,700
normalizing the date is tricky even
other things around here like they were

513
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,839
only able to go to one workshop but some
people provided a score for boat so

514
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:29,180
normalization of the data so that you
have some data for you this is my poor

515
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,430
attempt at creating an infographic I'm
really good at this stuff but I try

516
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:39,029
these this is all data from Chicago last
year we had 53 pizza 10 that's the

517
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:44,640
gender breakdown on and to me it's just
the so popular that to some value of the

518
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,259
total population I don't believe that
there's really about a quarter of the

519
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,720
gender interested in this email versus
mail I just think that was seeing more

520
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,288
and more women get into the space and
that's pretty cool but you know whatever

521
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:04,670
its 50 50 that's great too but I don't
really think this representative of the

522
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:11,809
industry globally or even in the us- the
next number down we look at who first

523
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:16,180
time there so that larger graphic 36
versus 12 that was their first time

524
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,750
there the next one down it was evenly
divided

525
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,130
boys and two girls that was our second
half for kids and one kid went to all

526
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:31,359
three have to be related news my son we
intentionally don't ask the specific age

527
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,589
of attending even though the Copa laws
we still want to respect them so we ask

528
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:40,910
for range and we found that our sweet
spot is eight to 12 and I think part of

529
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,950
it is because it's my kids and their
friends and talking to their parents and

530
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,839
all of that type of networking but we
did get some teenagers and some of them

531
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:55,440
found the information valuable and we
had four kids that were seven years old

532
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,660
experiment that lowering it for each
group its seven to seventeen so it's

533
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,230
very hard to you know that's a big
spread as far as academic an absolute

534
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,279
level so we do these challenges we have
a different gradients for younger were

535
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,240
novices all the way

536
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:18,290
me which nation's most popular on the
left you see the technology destruction

537
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,670
village who doesn't like to take things
apart we have that with everyone in the

538
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,080
room

539
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,490
enjoy doing that the one on the right
that was most attended was a lockpicking

540
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,310
village

541
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:34,860
kinda looking at the people that visited
the lockpick village we had 28 kids

542
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:43,570
visit the lockpick village that we had
12 who actually top five min walk in

543
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,920
right as soon as we talk about the
lockpick village perfect timing sir six

544
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,160
kids that did the six and nine kids did
the cops but there's only like really

545
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,960
one kid top cops and let her know that
you don't do anything else just wanted

546
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:08,140
to get out of hand and then one kid got
as far as six which I thought I have

547
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:15,290
trouble and get all the way to six that
was really impressive network security

548
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,600
activity station we had nine kids there

549
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:28,230
90999 every exercise but only seven of
nine beds I start tricking injection

550
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:33,869
seven of nine were actually able to do
the hidden file challenges it's still my

551
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,180
head and my looking at my next wife over
there

552
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:42,899
trouble now my wife cannot watch this so
I'll challenge was hidden in there just

553
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,900
actually collecting network traffic and
then they had to find the image that was

554
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:52,380
no website and find this equipment
engine light up a kid we had 10 kids go

555
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,190
to that area and all of them all tended
every exercise but only two that it is

556
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,670
the second hardest challenge Fibonacci

00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,330
competition things are not going your
way or maybe it's just not exactly you

effort to provide as much quality as
possible and these are just a couple of

576
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,030
comments and the only thing we ever
received was why there's so many people

577
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,430
we register but that was coming from the
registration company which we moved away

578
