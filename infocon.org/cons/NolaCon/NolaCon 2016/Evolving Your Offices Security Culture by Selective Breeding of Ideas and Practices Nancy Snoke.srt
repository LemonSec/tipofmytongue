1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
bhai im Anschluss network and this is my
talk about evolving security culture and

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,690
it's a story based talk but that also
looks that littered share and that

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,600
that's available to sew a quick look at
who am I i just started my own business

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,529
this year

5
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,279
magic scared elo sleep it specializes in
finding and fixing but abilities and web

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,149
and mobile applications I couldn't
decide where they want to be a

7
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:38,660
penetration tester or developer that
resulted in both educationally I got my

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,010
Bachelors of Science Engineering in
computer engineering and physics with a

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,610
minor map at Tulane University of the
street and got a master's in computer

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,399
science dropped out of my PhD program
and on Twitter that's my company email

11
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:02,829
address company website and my personal
blog give anyone interested so all the

12
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,110
stories I'm gonna tell our true stories
where I changed all the names to protect

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,539
the insecure people and so I am
pseudonyms and I stole the ball from the

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,840
trustee archives by Charles Strouse
could I just needed a good place so it's

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,869
a good novel so I'm gonna be bob Mr
Howard in the first story and the other

16
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,369
characters and he is a good manager who
might sometimes go overboard on

17
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:34,130
theoretical stuff and so the first story
a failure that should never happen

18
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:41,500
start something like brand new job and
is my new manager and this company sort

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,110
of a company in transition

20
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,829
they're trying to get their security
stuff right but they don't have a

21
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,020
program yet so they're working on it so
my first day and it comes up and says

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,500
hey Bob I really low your security
background I want to really make use of

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,680
it can you write me a proposal for what
we need to improve on our company I'm

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,040
just like great I want to write the
proposal

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,860
and he's like ok just lemme know when
you're done no details so I decided to

26
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,830
take it from there without asking any
further questions and I do some research

27
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,590
I'll check out what's going on in the
company cuz I was near there and I write

28
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:29,800
this gorgeous beautiful pic proposal
covering everything with two pages of

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:38,959
citations and very technical it was
beautiful I Thunderbird Andy and say hey

30
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,730
and he will let me know you think and
couple days later it back to me so I

31
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,829
like hey did you get a chance to read
that yet read through the abstract but I

32
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,080
haven't really been implementing further
so whatever ends up happening is he

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,730
never read so this is a great
opportunity how often did somebody asked

34
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:10,750
you cannot make proposals how can we
improve but then complete failure

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,890
because I wrote something that wasn't
what they wanted yes try to avoid that

36
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:28,100
much thickness and next thing I'm gonna
do is like a post-mortem what went wrong

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,470
here which is just introspective
questions you can ask yourself and they

38
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,609
don't have to be these questions these
are just once but being to be generally

39
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,080
applicable so what was the best thing
about what happened what was the worst

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,080
thing how could this have been improved
and what could I have done differently

41
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,870
while this case here the best thing was
that I did research and figured out what

42
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,840
the company needed in terms of security
and the worst thing with and no one read

43
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,769
it and have been improved well probably
should have been shorter clear may be

44
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,840
given a PowerPoint this company left
power points and maybe focus on one or

45
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,900
two important changes instead of letting
them with a whole list is that

46
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,160
overwhelms people and then terms of what
I could have done differently I could've

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,330
been curious when I first got the
assignment then just been great I could

48
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,020
have said Oh what areas are you
interested in or do you think Pacific in

49
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,780
mind and no harm is talking to which I
sort of our attention on what just keep

50
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,789
it short easy to follow and focus on the
benefit to the company which is what

51
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:48,710
management types generally like this
little failure is what got me started

52
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,150
thinking about security culture to begin
with and how hard it is to make anything

53
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:58,159
change and so this is a good point to
just do a brief overview of what

54
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,070
literature says about security culture
before going on to similar story so you

55
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,520
just go to google and type in culture
definition this is what you get the

56
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,539
behaviors beliefs values and symbols of
a group that are passed along by

57
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,630
communication an invitation from one
generation to the next and if you do the

58
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,900
thing with security you get the state of
being free from danger threat so we can

59
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,698
just drive really quickly security
culture is behaviors beliefs values and

60
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:30,990
symbols of a group that helped them
became from danger and the important

61
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,530
thing in this is actually that word
group culture because there is no

62
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,520
culture for one person you have to have
multiple people there be culture and so

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,080
if you're looking at how you can change
the culture in a security culture and a

64
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
company or something

65
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,219
looking at this group behaviour so
culture requires people and we can use

66
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,720
no look on as an example and so yet
we're a group of people so there is a

67
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,710
culture here which would be different
and I we have years and believes than

68
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,609
random tourists on the street

69
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,789
ok and some of those ways of a
difference is probably will probably

70
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:24,340
have better passwords that the behavior
and also within any corporation or group

71
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,150
you have the main culture but you have
some groups but people onto those each

72
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,628
have their own culture there are no
economy of our sponsors are organizers

73
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:42,419
that speakers attendees and important
thing about these subgroups culture is a

74
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,318
very strong subject culture me hard to
change the whole group culture because

75
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:55,430
the subgroups orders it's changing so
briefly there's also a hierarchy in all

76
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,129
these cultures and depending on where
you are you're allowed to do different

77
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,659
actions and loved ones if you step out
of line like this was a wolf pack which

78
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,770
has a hierarchy and he stepped out of
line you get beaten up by the Wolves

79
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,060
with people were generally more
civilized but similar things and I just

80
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,509
made up a little higher keep or no luck
on which could or could not be correct

81
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:23,610
but I put the organizers at the top
there like to most people what to do and

82
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,190
this overlap between groups and as I
said the sponsors and the speakers but

83
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,419
have some chance of influencing regular
attendees and sponsors do it by

84
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:40,529
incentivizing you you know it's a great
drawn at re playing out there so you

85
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,900
change your behavior by giving them your
card and talking to them and the

86
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,960
speakers by maybe think something that's
influential

87
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,750
you step out of where you are in the
hierarchy and you can get in trouble

88
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,040
when you're trying to change culture so
what are the ways you can change the

89
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,150
culture and that's why you to change the
people the technology or the policies

90
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,870
and by people I don't mean literally
changing the people in the group so

91
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,360
adding new people moving people and a
quick example if you have a group of

92
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,160
people who get together every saturday
to play Axis and Allies you know when

93
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,960
you add two new people to it and maybe
these two new people they'll have access

94
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,289
now as we also want to play another game
betrayal the house on the hill so then

95
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,189
you change the culture not just the
group plays expertise on Saturday at

96
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,880
your place access now lies or trail at
the house when the hell did you change

97
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,350
the technology so they're the technology
is a board game in that example we can

98
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:54,130
change it to a land game gaming system
and you changed the culture and if we

99
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,600
change the policy and policies can be
written or unwritten so i cant gaming

100
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,060
group they probably don't have any
written policies and unwritten policy

101
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,270
that you always bring beer to the other
person's house and somebody may say hey

102
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,610
I can't drink beer anymore

103
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:21,710
fattening their suffering like changing
the culture right so a quick side story

104
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:29,180
on policy enforcement and this case this
is after the first story happened I was

105
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,489
given an assignment to write some
policies on secure coding and PCI

106
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,560
compliant and I was like I thought it
sounded great and I didn't fall into the

107
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,739
trap i didnt first or taking too long

108
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,470
writing thing I got into by short
sentences that he thought you'd be PCI

109
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,180
compliant

110
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,239
and I had extra details when I was
really happy about it I was like ok

111
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,490
these people need that they need to know
how to do some of those right there are

112
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:04,410
two inputs integration you know and i
was thinkin all the country's gonna

113
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,279
change but because there was no
enforcement people said they read it

114
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,760
they signed off on it nobody came to
anything so you have to do something to

115
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,970
either positively or negatively
reinforce their policies are no one's

116
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:28,970
gonna do anything so I can't really in
favor of too much negative reinforcement

117
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,760
you don't want people scared that
they're going to lose their jobs report

118
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,730
a security incident caused them they
won't they'll just try to cover it up

119
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,520
and be harder to figure out so I I do
like positive reinforcement when

120
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,199
possible but sometimes you have to at
least have some sort of negative

121
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:57,910
feedback alright so I stole this graph
from Josh Morris book on job

122
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,160
reconnaissance I think there's something
to be said about the type of management

123
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,860
and it was taken into how you can change
culture and so when you start off with

124
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,529
company at the very beginning when your
tiny like cowboy style management owner

125
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,700
I think what goes on and on change the
culture there you just have to talk to

126
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,760
the owners and get them on board and
then when they go bigger one person

127
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,150
cannot just be in charge like that trust
based management which is when every

128
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,130
person there is delegated
responsibilities entrusted to do it and

129
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,839
then you get even bigger and you hire
more people and you can't trust everyone

130
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,290
someone's gonna do something stupid
you're gonna have to add policies and

131
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,069
have a hierarchy because well some
people are going to be stupid and that's

132
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,320
when you get likely structured
management and that's when it starts

133
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,630
getting harder to change culture because
you have to

134
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,180
in the hierarchy follow the rules but
it's still very doable and when you get

135
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,199
something highly structured around for a
long time then you really do need to

136
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,240
stay in your little box and they're
probably sixty thousand people in your

137
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,860
company and its pretty impossible to
change the corporate culture unless you

138
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,070
are that person in that position of like
the security officer he's allowed to be

139
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,060
changing it so if you're trying to
change it you're not in that position

140
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,250
could be really tough and you'd probably
be better off trying to change your

141
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,240
groups like your department's culture
and hoping someone recognized this back

142
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,190
how great that you're

143
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:45,820
change so I was going to get two story
too and I'll be back again

144
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,540
of harriet was a really bad manager some
really clever co-workers her pinky and

145
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,849
the brain the interim security had his
hairy ride from accounting who's the

146
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,790
person who's doing a job they have no
clue about if it's dangerous they will

147
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,810
kill themselves

148
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,630
auditors who are internal compliance and
angleton who is smart tough higher up

149
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:15,760
and then getting we have andy is the
ninth manager for this one's called for

150
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,720
assistance in the wake of oblivion and
it starts with me going to meeting with

151
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,080
Harriet its first me my yearly review
but here it's no longer my boss so we're

152
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,270
just going to be making plays that check
is nothing she says really matters at

153
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:39,439
this point and so she's like bob tell me
about your current projects I do for a

154
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,700
bit and I said so what exciting things
are you working on welfare in this one

155
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,170
cool thing that we're working on
accounting actually came up with the

156
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,170
idea it's really cool Oh what is that

157
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,660
well we found out a way to get rid of
all those password reset request that we

158
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,160
are calling customer service

159
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,050
oh how are you gonna do that I would
either gonna get rid of the password

160
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:11,879
how you gonna do that well we're just
gonna have another first and last name

161
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,639
birthday gift card

162
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,999
great well what if we have to customers
with the same name for things that we

163
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:25,860
don't need to check what about the fact
you might know that information or

164
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:34,170
someone else could be a charity problem
no its ok he's working on it

165
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:43,149
gonna work on it it's great so very very
difficult person so it is a good idea to

166
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,559
not try to change her mind

167
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:52,879
difficult people just hostilities so I
backed away from that and get

168
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,459
information and decided to take it
elsewhere so when you're trying to make

169
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:03,089
a decision and you don't know what to do
you can do a pre mortem which to get a

170
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:08,959
series of questions to sort of figure
out what steps today so in this case and

171
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,349
what's the best case scenario and that's
the business polls it's really silly

172
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,100
idea and what's the worst-case not
putting the idea what am I feeling

173
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,749
annoyed and why do I ask what I'm
feeling and that's because I'm angry or

174
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:27,860
upset in anyway I might do something
really stupid based on that and if I

175
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,550
make myself acknowledge what I'm feeling
a lot less likely to act on that feeling

176
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:38,740
and did something really stupid and what
steps do I take well to pinky you can

177
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,519
take care of it that's why do I say hey
I just was with gary Herbert this

178
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,149
password list thing I think it sounds
like it might be a bad day what do you

179
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,019
think

180
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,189
yeah well I had some reservations on
that I actually sent an email to Harriet

181
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:56,879
and auditors inherit from the back said
it was fine and the others there was

182
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,879
nothing so not sure what to do

183
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,320
oh you know

184
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,350
well i think im just so what i do if i
just decided to go to take it to harry

185
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,720
the interim committee person

186
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,740
interim because the company is trying to
start a big security program but they

187
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,130
haven't actually found the head yet so
there is the interim person and I'm

188
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,170
friends with them so I decided just to
jump over and talk to harry if we can

189
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:30,719
take care of it yes there's a lot of
running around and they're hairy you

190
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,870
know what's going on about this past
when this thing and I find out who

191
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,270
haven't so I tell me about it and then
he immediately these the problem then we

192
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,560
brainstorm how to take advantage of that
this for a few minutes and he said

193
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,910
alright yeah I can take care of this for
you just get whoever has problems to

194
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,209
email me or send an email and tell them
they have a problem with canceling it

195
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:00,110
reply back completely take care of it
but I'm so busy and I'm gonna be leaving

196
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:09,270
the company so you need to do best which
is an annoying thing but I go back to

197
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,780
pinky and have him send it out I'm
really not supposed to be involved in

198
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:21,439
this and so he does and we wait
patiently and yet nobody sends back

199
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,010
anything which is a little weird holiday
and obviously not always if you put

200
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:33,550
responses to leave the company and not
big and so the next step is actually me

201
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:39,700
ramping 2 p.m. the brain and think hey
you know this is just really annoying

202
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,920
and the brain says while we choose to go
up a level elevated up to andy is the

203
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,770
next higher area sports and make sure he
knows what's going on so we do that we

204
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,420
elevate the and explain the situation to
him he doesn't quite get it the way he

205
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,310
did but he sees it there's a problem

206
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,690
anyone's ass to document that we've at
least advised everyone not to do this he

207
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,800
doesn't quite go completely saying no to
the business the way I would but yeah he

208
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,139
wants to cover our butts

209
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,410
and they want us to send everyone out
another email there's a lot of emailing

210
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:21,760
here and say that this is a bad idea and
we do that and we start waiting

211
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,420
patiently again and we don't get a
response from a lot of errors but

212
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:32,670
there's a meeting next week and with
bread from accounting and pinky and what

213
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,620
happens is he is really quite upset he
doesn't understand what's going on where

214
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,889
are questioning the businesses ideas and
he's at that so at this point we're all

215
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,680
upset too so time to think about what to
do and we do know the little prince

216
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,540
norodom and we still want the business
to pull the idea we still the worst

217
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,790
cases not pointing idea at this point I
feel like getting up in the company

218
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,190
implement this what steps to be taken to
elevate the angleton who in our higher

219
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,270
get this company good bosses bosses boss
at this point about the highest first up

220
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,550
we can feel that we can go talk to about
breaking you know the rules that were

221
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,370
allowed to do so we do that we explain
it to him he says he's completely taking

222
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,129
it out of our hands he looked up some
people may auditors and show them how

223
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:29,710
easy it is to company information and
send it to them and yeah it gets taken

224
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,230
care of just like that so there's a
little bit of rating still but corrected

225
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:44,050
so just a quick look what happened here
what was the best thing that we got it

226
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,919
stopped the persistence and elevating
the worst thing was believed that time

227
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,480
in months several month process and what
could be improved better communication

228
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,070
possibly to keep the business of getting
upset alright improve the speed of the

229
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,310
response and what we've done differently

230
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,310
well we knew the author was well-known
for disliking my email so maybe it's not

231
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,030
too long ago

232
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,820
tried something short and snappy or just
picked up the phone to call an expert

233
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:23,240
meeting about the complaint that she
tried to get things moving faster so

234
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,750
Story 3 is about raising security
awareness and developers and in this one

235
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,990
we're evaluating sonar for static
analysis of code something I'm doing and

236
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,920
this is something I already thought they
needed with more security awareness but

237
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,230
I'm going around I see so I picked up
something looking at the code around it

238
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,840
I see an interesting comment I don't
know if you can read that but the

239
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,740
attempt to load their username and
password from cookies the values are

240
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,710
decrypted using strong cryptography
enhance security well that catches my

241
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:00,250
eye so I'm like oh well what are they
doing what in the next class under so I

242
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,260
go to the next class and I'm get this
class uses strong cryptography for

243
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,230
enhanced security in the common at the
top there really like that phrase strong

244
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,440
cryptography for enhanced security
anyone want to take a guess what

245
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:21,300
algorithm I find they're using here that
they called strong cryptography yeah I

246
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:32,320
know why but no single death in family
thought it was drunk I actually had to

247
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,850
look up in the source control when this
was written like could this possibly

248
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,110
have been written long ago that would've
been ok those 2007 that was awhile ago

249
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:48,179
but they should have known better so I
decided that was the last straw so to

250
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:57,430
speak on the developer training go and
so my response after I laughed

251
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,040
hysterically cause asthma attack

252
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,210
Heller

253
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,679
is to write an email for saying hey we
have to get this dead out of our code is

254
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:16,880
broken in 1998 it takes a second to
brute force you know it not security

255
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,929
it's just pretending and to whoever
thinks this is obviously shouldn't be

256
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:31,220
working on our code we need to have some
training and they respond as well we'll

257
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,390
try to get that changed as soon as
possible but we don't have the money for

258
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,860
training

259
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,799
well I could work out some training what
we don't have the time to put you on it

260
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:47,720
right now so my pre more of what I
should do the best case scenario is that

261
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,899
we want them to train their developers
on security the worst someone keeps on

262
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:54,629
thinking does is strong crypto

263
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,760
my feeling I'm actually feeling very
ready for action and what I do I create

264
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,419
some training in my free time I can't
jump on terror group at lunch and I get

265
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:11,870
metrics to show the efficacy is actually
quite a bit so I bet on metrics if

266
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,989
you're doing training their two dogs and
metrics you can get your learning metric

267
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,250
which measure what you did on the
learning activity which can be like

268
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,450
doing a survey before and after and then
you can compare the results to see how

269
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,649
their opinions and things have changed
your knowledge test at the end and then

270
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:34,408
there's the results metrics which major
change in behavior and that's when you

271
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:38,730
get a baseline before like example if
you're doing fishing you see how you can

272
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,260
click on the pitch in your mouth or in
this case how many security bags are

273
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:51,750
they are static analysis and then after
the training you can do this again and

274
00:23:51,750 --> 00:24:04,360
look for improvement so far as I know
there aren't any really insecure Java

275
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,320
apps but anyone's . if anyone knows of
any I'd love to hear about it but it's

276
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,220
called the damn venerable over
apparently cute tack when you could

277
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,130
share kept at pictures of people and
comment on them and you have a private

278
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,860
cute cat picture with other people
weren't allowed to see it was too cute

279
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:28,129
so but then here's the survey I don't
know how readable that is this is an

280
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,830
actual example some people didn't like
me and the questions are like on a scale

281
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:39,678
from one to five how knowledgeable are
you on secure coding practices of balls

282
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,270
to your knowledge have you ever could
have something that was insecure I put

283
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,010
this one up here on purpose because this
was one of the comment if I did I wasn't

284
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:53,070
aware that that says we're just sort of
the point of that question with

285
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,059
hopefully that after learning about
secure coding you realize you've

286
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:02,200
probably had coded something insecure
gal 125 how important is it to make sure

287
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,770
your code is secure and I don't get as
dirty encoding what percent of the time

288
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:12,250
and then after the class I had people
Institute reports questions that I will

289
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,470
be able to use this information to the
right and I have already used this

290
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:27,250
information to improve the security so
my results on that scale of one to five

291
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,500
how old are you

292
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,710
we had a poor average of 2.2 by an actor
average of 2.7 a little bit of

293
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,720
improvement and to your knowledge have
you ever gotten something insecure we

294
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:48,360
went from 50% to 80% true which was nice
how important is it before 4.25 and

295
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,070
after four point four

296
00:25:50,070 --> 00:26:05,169
and how often do you think about
security when coding 6266 and I will be

297
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,510
able to use the information to improve
the security of the country right and

298
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:17,350
I've already used this year to Qatar
right when I note on this is a small

299
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,860
company there were twenty some
developers altogether so that was a

300
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,590
volunteer group I got seventies show up
for the first lunch somewhere in the

301
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,860
middle

302
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,719
drop down to three and then we went back
up to five so their numbers are not

303
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,230
statistically significant but still
metrics are always a nice thing to show

304
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,150
people when you're trying to convince
them to go with the program so after

305
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,920
this is done I should gather up these
metrics I try to say hey look they were

306
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,930
also the other night I want to make here
was they didn't improve as much as you

307
00:26:52,930 --> 00:27:01,810
might think like 62 66 percent to point
to to 2.25 to 2.50 whatever they think

308
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,690
very minimal improvement I think that's
because the people who would give up

309
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,700
their lunches to go learn about security
are probably the people already a little

310
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,430
more security conscious so there is less
improvement there would have been

311
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:21,270
because everyone but yeah I said this
off I think hey I really think we should

312
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:28,070
look into doing this training I could do
something formally for everyone and

313
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,909
they're like really happy with the
result really glad we did lunch but

314
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:40,610
still thought so and to the PCI otters I
love talking to the auditors

315
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:46,090
I'm probably the only one who never
voluntarily so I want to work with the

316
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:53,480
auditors after speaking with the PCI
auditors they recommended the scare

317
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,740
coding class and I teach it and people
listen to yours

318
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,670
didn't get them to suggest something

319
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:07,650
normally our company will implement it
at least that's my experience and so

320
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,400
then after they made that recommendation
then it was like solid solidly down I

321
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:21,540
was going to do this and then when we
were planning this company finally got

322
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,990
their new security officer I talked to
them about getting this done and they

323
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,750
were really impressed and they want me
to help out with all sorts of other

324
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,440
security awareness program which is
great so got me that pertain to actually

325
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:46,900
work on culture everywhere which started
out as it was going to be a complete

326
00:28:48,470 --> 00:29:09,570
completely turn itself around 15 minutes
but luckily we started late so I will

327
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,909
say my conclusions are you should one
consider your company before trying to

328
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,960
change the key security culture and see
what would work and keep your actions

329
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,800
within those allowed if you're in a
tight hierarchy because you don't get

330
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,440
into trouble you can use a post-mortem
to analyze failures or premodern to make

331
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,350
the best decision midway and adjust your
questions or suggestions

332
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:40,100
you know do whatever works for you and
can't get permission to run a program

333
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,520
you can always try doing something
voluntary and I still really believe in

334
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,870
getting metrics to show that they work
even though they didn't it didn't work

335
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,399
in my case I think it will work with
some people that have to I love metrics

336
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
I can't be the only one

337
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,100
and yes use external auditors to your
advantage since no one no one wants to

338
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,540
deal with the Otters generally be really
easy to be the person who explains our

339
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:15,180
policy is if people don't want to spend
days in meetings and you may not want to

340
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,940
either but you think they're like using
them to your advantage you might then

341
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:34,550
there's some resources but the book
build a security culture by name that's

342
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:42,960
probably a good framework type book it
doesn't go into the specifics of what

343
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,140
should be in security culture but just
how to set up like a framework of for

344
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,080
whatever part of the scary coaching you
want to change this is how you go about

345
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,010
changing and has a lot of background
information security culture premark

346
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,150
also has a lot of good information like
this special time metrics and how to get

347
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,700
good metrics and put those up building
an information security awareness

348
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:12,650
program by bill Gardner and Billy Thomas
is a very thorough book about all the

349
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,340
different pieces you want to have put
together and I personally found some

350
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,060
information you could extrapolate from
energies and shelf inches but waters

351
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,990
does all focus on corporate fishing
programs but you can actually apply some

352
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:32,370
of that in other ways and I used his
chart I put up John Josh Mars

353
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:40,909
Reconnaissance book that as a resource
that was all I had any questions

354
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,390
yeah

355
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:09,050
is actually trying to train people
actually the best number to use this six

356
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:33,780
sessions to really learn it over a
period of time divided over six weeks I

357
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:45,090
was starting with it was a combination
of stuff so there was this is exactly

358
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,830
how he thinks that using Java like we do
here but then there was also some of

359
00:32:48,830 --> 00:33:03,179
just this is what makes this bad
beginning with the marginal so pretty

360
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:11,620
much everyone you know CSS Javascript
jQuery that sort of thing too but I

361
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:19,780
meant almost all java-based tough job
and be seen whether I love doing things

362
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:27,730
like that for any language personally
anything out anyone have any good

363
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,610
stories about trying to change culture
now

364
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:44,510
funny stories I always try to come up
with the best examples but now I did

365
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,350
through that I hope I was clear but

366
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,909
well thank you all
