1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
in a few of tokens is good for that if
you need more tokens you can harass

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,850
sponsors to give them to you or we are
selling the tokens up at the front desk

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,120
as well they're five bucks a drink with
the hotel charges for drinks so we want

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,590
to help out so with that said I would
agree X if you're not playing with any

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,769
of our to CT office please check them
out we have been nice pyramid technical

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,049
CTF going on all the way down the hall
in the open source stuff last I checked

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,720
so few people were doing the open source
in the trader based CET effet victory

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,839
was like guaranteed and come up with you
can you can only wins

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:55,010
alright how's everybody doing you know
the thing I like about no luck on first

10
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,970
talk is it 1 o'clock that's awesome

11
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,300
stench alright well at least I got to
sleep in today

12
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:16,070
rights who today just give a basic
network monitoring in analysis talk so

13
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,070
we're gonna go through this so
traditional disclaimer you know these

14
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,970
are my own views they're not the views
of Lake my family my kids my way my

15
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,390
in-laws people they work for customers
to the stuff like that so these are all

16
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:39,420
mine so I hill from the medal dc-area so
is there anybody from a dc-area here now

17
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,530
I knew few people that were gonna be
here but so a little bit about me so the

18
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,170
industry for about 20 years I think the
slides of the year old but then in

19
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,369
industry for over 20 years of about
seventy those years have been focused on

20
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:00,369
information security prior to that I was
just basically doing I T type stuff

21
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:05,399
which is where I learned all the basics
in all the different I T rooms that you

22
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,030
know really hoped when I transition to
the security in in choosing a career in

23
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,770
Information Security past five or so
years I've been working in more of an

24
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,270
operational environment doing sock type
stuff

25
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,420
but as you can see there you know I over
the years I've done a lot of things you

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,929
know it started out doing fun stuff like
10 testing and web application testing

27
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,780
and then I got into more the paperwork
tape stuff in the middle of my career

28
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,020
sitting like security engineering
working for the government doing this

29
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,900
type stuff for accreditation did props
and fine in that you know really fun

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,830
stuff but at a certain point I decided
that he wanted to try to get more into

31
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,540
doing some of the technical aspects of
security so I was able to win a job just

32
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,340
doing cannot read studies with looking
at all the different products that are

33
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,180
out there doing take us said that was
fine in like I said the past few years

34
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,520
I've been working in a sock everything
from me in in almost all the way up to

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:16,190
now where we are merely doing training
and I guess sort of advisers so you know

36
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,130
trying to help people make their socks
more fish in to this is my website if

37
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,600
you wanna check it out and over in the
sector com been running it since 2008 I

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,579
go through periods where a blog a lot
like sometimes three times a day and

39
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,310
then some times where I do you like 10
months so depends on how much time I

40
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,280
have so doing you know trying to like
everybody else in security I'm trying to

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,150
start my own thing cause I'm tired of
trying to work cuz I'm tired of working

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,340
for the big man in making money for them
and not myself to be interested hit me

43
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,290
up

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,840
alright so today on to the topic that
we're gonna be talking about is is

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,640
monitoring and network security so just
go through a little introduction talked

46
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,399
about an environment of how you can set
this up to learn your so we're set

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,520
something up in an enterprise
environment the methodology for how to

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,760
get through so if you're an analyst you
know what's the process for going

49
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,980
through that and it secondly we're to
learn more

50
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,630
for people that want to get into it as
well as analysts that they may have

51
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,250
certain

52
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,250
knowledge gaps to help fill fill those
most of those are off read and then the

53
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,900
next thing is you know what now so
you've heard this talk you've done these

54
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,099
things and you know what can you do now

55
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,940
rights to first I want to talk about
just you know why why I'm doing this in

56
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,020
in just some basic definitions to do so
that we all get baseline to the same

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,960
level so the first one is you know it's
for

58
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,620
I don't know I get somebody like myself
where mid-career I was doing more people

59
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,280
based security and I want to get more
hands on to it was a great time for

60
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,760
maybe general security practitioners to
go in and get back into doing something

61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,060
hands on stuff a lot of the knowledge
that they have we was very useful in in

62
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,800
in so it it wasn't that bad of a
transition plus it was in an operational

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,570
environment so it was a lot more fun if
you spend too much time designing

64
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:28,210
security you know you have these
theoretical understandings of you know

65
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,039
these academic understandings of house
stuff is supposed to work but when you

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,300
get in the real world doesn't work like
that so it's good to get that experience

67
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,430
regardless in the second group is you
know maybe you just started working in a

68
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:50,760
soccer doing analysis and II kinda
giving giving you a crew a career path

69
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,620
here how to do your job more effectively
and also if there are any specific

70
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,669
knowledge gaps

71
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:02,340
trying to give you sort of the map of
what needs to be filled in nicely it's

72
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,010
kind of fun you know we all like to
watch TV shows and you know mystery in

73
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,390
order to solve the crime and stuff and
so you know essentially that's what it's

74
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,840
kinda like you know so you're gonna get
in there and get this alert and then

75
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,640
you're gonna have to learn as much about
that it is possible to de- termine you

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,270
know hey is this something that we're
going to investigate

77
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,229
for there is something we can
investigate further there in then make

78
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:33,280
the decision if you want to go down that
path so the first thing is so how many

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,599
of you here you know done worked in an
operational environment like a soccer

80
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,790
something like that

81
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:47,440
ok for keeping hands up for the people
that are brave enough to put their hands

82
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,240
up so how would you define what network
monitoring and announces

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:07,120
everyone's learning that he and now any
anybody I i have candy she should get

84
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:16,840
that was hoping you can spot a pattern
quickly and way too much

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,990
yeah right any other thoughts here what
do you like Twix Snickers Milky Way

86
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:32,500
nothing no I don't you can tap somebody
that if you want to give it to someone

87
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:45,260
else would he tell him we're all getting
old are you want what would you want

88
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:53,599
Nikki way nice catch nagano Holden
watching on sugar kind of fun stuff

89
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,840
anymore

90
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,820
any israeli is there anyone else wants
to you take a you know shot and get some

91
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:11,230
free candy I need to have like a really
good candy apparently is not a

92
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,250
motivating factor right so so my funny
answers it's basically the monitoring

93
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:23,770
analysis of networks right so and in
this is from Richard be a liquor towel

94
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,640
security to follow him on Twitter in one
of his old books you know I think it's

95
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,069
like 2002 2003 and so he basically
defined it was the collection analysis

96
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:41,070
and escalation of indicators in warnings
to detect in response to intrusions so

97
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,440
there's a formal definition you know I'm
a process guys why wouldn't a process

98
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,880
that more like a framework I so I I like
to have kind of a path laid out until I

99
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,020
kinda just tentatively kind of break
things down into there's a selection

100
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,770
says there's a there's a triage phase
and there's an analyzed his right so

101
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,090
keeping that in mind so for those that
have heard in socks before like what do

102
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:15,700
you think how would you define what goes
on in a selection of teas ok signatures

103
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,450
so so you're gonna like stuff based on
certain signatures ok thats foundation

104
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:32,000
Milky Way got my arms gonna kill me
after this election him no assets or

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,700
anybody else selection what's the
selection process like how do you select

106
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:55,400
the of your gonna look at anomalies
sessions are uncertain about their

107
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,650
training people right so that's enough
of that so really it's just basically

108
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,439
just you know don't using a letter to
investigate just kind of like what you

109
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,110
guys said you know there are different
ways and we'll go over that of of how to

110
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,510
choose them but those are two really you
choose the most high quality and

111
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,000
relevant alerts from the centers that
are out there and really we're looking

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,270
at you know not necessarily what the
vendor says is high but the key word

113
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,050
here is role relevant trying to
distinguish out of all those alerts are

114
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:36,640
flooding our systems which one are
relevant to your organization rate so

115
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,670
then so then the order so it really
varies by organization you know some

116
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,490
organizations if they're just starting
out it's probably just to see you see

117
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,220
just do whatever you want if it's more
and more mature they probably have a

118
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,210
process that they want you to follow
generally like going from you know some

119
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:08,750
high priority events all the way down to
low priority events right so I thought I

120
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,820
mister slide their rights to the next
area in Lake the second phase here is

121
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:26,610
triage and so how would you define would
realizes does it say what it's supposed

122
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:26,980
to

123
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:35,370
ok right away are expecting traffic to
look like versus you know what is

124
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:45,190
actually doing alright alright sorry
about that

125
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:53,830
get bad reviews right and anybody else

126
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,940
yeah

127
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:20,379
yes he made the medical analogy where in
your near the battlefield in in trying

128
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:28,670
to dive into the things that you can be
saved now vs stuff that can be pushed to

129
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,279
later right and you don't want any candy
I'm gonna stop throwing candy but I

130
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:40,769
think people are mad at me but alright
so basically quickly separating the

131
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:45,949
alerts needing further analysis from the
irrelevant ones like you at least in

132
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:50,540
security room that that's how I kind of
look at it because depending on how much

133
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,480
air sensor admins are you could be
flooded with star so you know really

134
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,350
being able to parse through that and
pick out the South its most relevant to

135
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,749
your organization so the goals are to
you identify alerts needing for their

136
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:09,499
investigation disorder reseeding that in
the eniac activities that you're gonna

137
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:12,699
be doing here is your gonna be really
looking at the alerts in further detail

138
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:19,149
to discover why it fired you know hey
this stage the signature fired in in

139
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:23,370
sometimes you can get a little bit in
network traffic in looking at the

140
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,339
network traffic in saying hey we were
trying to alert on the keyword secret

141
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,629
you know but you know it it maybe
somebody emailing somebody else seen

142
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:39,689
saying oh here's the secret book here's
the secret anniversary location that

143
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:46,129
were gonna meet up rate so it may not be
as bad as what you think and I think one

144
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,459
of the most important things here is
what is whenever something fires you

145
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:54,679
know if if you get past that that point
is to look through the prior knowledge

146
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:00,350
that you have so missed organ
organizations is going to be incident

147
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:07,889
reports but I encourage you know socks
to have other I guess like analysts

148
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:14,949
knowledge bases where they can document
common things so so that is new people

149
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:17,349
come in they don't have to reinvent the
wheel

150
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:24,160
it endlessly just doing some basic open
source analysis as well some internal

151
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,040
analysis to determine things like re
well let's look at the source and

152
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,420
destination IP and in the ports and
proved caused you determine if this is

153
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:40,150
something like say it was like a Linux
attack against like a you know Microsoft

154
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,760
Web server well you know we really don't
care too much about that until the last

155
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,770
area that we're looking at here is an
analysis based on the first two phases

156
00:14:51,770 --> 00:15:01,010
what do you think I'm talking about here
whenever I say announces ok looking into

157
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:15,980
the incident so what types of things do
you think we would be doing there now

158
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:23,080
we're source destination IP IDs yeah
anybody else

159
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:35,120
the response traffic in how often it
happens if there's damage with that

160
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,160
damage is ok right now I'm not gonna
throw these anymore but if you wanna

161
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,540
come up in USD questioning just leave
these appeared for you to grab alright

162
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,980
so I tried defined as you know so you
have your your primary sources which are

163
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,540
you are usually your sensors you know in
in in in in there are 0 none of these

164
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,900
things that aren't specifically centers
but their devices that are supporting

165
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:13,530
resources to determine the validity of
that attack into the girls here are to

166
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:18,140
determine the actions at the attacker
may have taken within your network

167
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,160
key activities that you would be doing
here is basically the key indicators

168
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,730
which you've found probably from your
alert such thing is like Eyed Peas dont

169
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:37,500
means ports things like that you know
look using those as pieces of data that

170
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:44,589
you can get off of to go look through
these data repository so things like you

171
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,370
know hey i'm looking like that first and
if you're lucky enough to have full

172
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,960
packet capture unit being able to dive
in and there's a whole bunch of

173
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,630
resources hear that a lot of people
don't take advantage of a number to talk

174
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:04,970
about that a little later Wright city
environment ok so the first areas and i

175
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,740
wanna talk about you know is you know
really what is so we're talking about

176
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,370
the centers here in this doesn't do
traditionally were talking about like in

177
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:17,229
IDS and IPS you know it can be networked
laser can be no space but if you look at

178
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,270
more generically I mean you have
different sort of detection systems were

179
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,900
almost every Aussie have suffered losses
on emails to focus is on you know web

180
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,610
applications there is you know your
fancy stuff where where it

181
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,889
tools that you strip attachments out in
intraday explodes in a chamber to see

182
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,420
what they do so just think of it that
way so it's definitely you know nowadays

183
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:50,960
much more than just a basic network
ideas and usually you have there's two

184
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,559
types of their signature base which is
like a well whenever this attack is done

185
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,559
there is this specific series of
characters

186
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:13,470
folks idk again unfortunately every
media has yet again failed me and yet

187
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:19,320
the fastball to about the ninety minute
35 seconds mark for the audio resume so

188
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,000
yes I am looking for better video
capture devices to do not tell me

189
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,460
so i cant

190
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,309
alright so you have something the
network level traditionally you're

191
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,918
starting out with NetFlow which is just
basically you know never statistics you

192
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,169
know based on source and destination IP
imports you know determining who talked

193
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:07,450
to who and how much data is transferred
so nesler the advantage of that is its

194
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,309
relatively small see store for long
amounts of time you know great for doing

195
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,860
running stuff that may have occurred
like six 6 months back in the second is

196
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,770
for packet capture and so you know
depending on the amount of traffic that

197
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:29,240
you have you may be able to store like a
few days of this you know the goal would

198
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,820
obviously try to get you know seven to
10 days or thirty days but depending on

199
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,740
how much funding you have that may not
be possible so the other thing that's

200
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,270
the actual network traffic but then you
have the logs that are sort of device

201
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,490
plugs that are helping transmit this
entry information throughout the network

202
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:56,149
so it seems like you're just firewall
logs and those are tremendously helpful

203
00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:02,379
just looking at connections that are set
up torn down there are certain protocols

204
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,630
that FTP added that have a lot of
information they're in the same thing

205
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,250
with routers and switches there's you
know all the words associated with those

206
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,789
two then you have application logs so
you know I think of like your mail

207
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,789
server your web server file server dns

208
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,419
whatever said these are logs that are
associated with that so you know right

209
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:34,140
now like DNS is big and I think proxies
have especially like HTTP proxies have

210
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,770
always been big has a lot of traffic
does overreached HTTP because it's wide

211
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,000
open hole so you know that used as an
attack vector as it's easy to the actor

212
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,440
has an excellent actor so it's a proxy
logs you can actually see a lot of that

213
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,290
stuff happening

214
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,560
if you didn't stop there and in other
detectable preventive sources is you may

215
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:06,050
have an idea system that has low alert
that you would normally just e nor well

216
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:13,470
you know whenever like you can also use
those those low priority in your sensing

217
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:22,740
infrastructure to gain more information
about a potential tax so they can be not

218
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:30,230
only a primary sources alerts but they
can be you know as supporting resource

219
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:39,110
as well to the external there's like a
gazillion places on the internet where

220
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,540
you can go and grab stuff so you know
dis with the stuff that I've done and

221
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,540
stuff that a teach-in a lot of people
that I talk to you

222
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,540
of trying to put together a kind of a
basic list of where to start until there

223
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,260
is other places

224
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:00,020
obviously Google is a big resource and
mean a lot of times you can distance

225
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,960
there's an indicator you can just search
for hidden like an IEP and see what

226
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,380
comes up for a half hour or so something
like that there there's also I think was

227
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,310
Jack crook put a cust a few years ago he
put a customized search engine a

228
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:21,310
customized Google search and in together
called active threat certain said he did

229
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:26,780
the same thing where he found like the
20 or so sites that he always uses for

230
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:34,100
doing OS in and he created a customized
search engine for it so you to search

231
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,419
for that good resource and then
definitely when you're dealing with like

232
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,720
I peas and beans looking at you know who
is dns type stuff so

233
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,309
and you never ever me a glitch but it's
starting to audio back up shortly

234
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:20,400
it I didn't move that I swear so passive
DNS is huge and then you also have your

235
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,930
old you knew traditional command line
type such as who is so the next category

236
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:35,930
Israel his reputation databases so you
are worried is so mean I recommend you

237
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,600
know if your gonna check out as you know
definitely doing the search first to see

238
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,820
if someone else had searched on it you
know there's a scary that that is you

239
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,080
get in

240
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,300
alert and you submit it lives

241
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,120
analysis to europe you are worried that
you know you're hitting the attackers

242
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,459
interests infrastructure and that's
tipping your hand it that you know how

243
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,030
to detect them but depending on you know
the sector that you're in you know that

244
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:11,060
may or may not be of significance in
enter a URL void in IP voice of those

245
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,120
are just kind of meh engines that put
together data from various sites that

246
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:25,479
measure website reputation in nineteen
reputation web archives is huge so

247
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,890
Google cash is always a fun you know
like a lot of times if if you'll find

248
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,630
out if your gonna go to try to see that
adversaries infrastructure maybe it's a

249
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,400
website or whatever you know you can
just google it and I headed directly in

250
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,830
an area and also the traditional way
back machine and then passive scanning

251
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,850
so I'm not talking about like you know
during active scanning say with nmap but

252
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,510
there's a lot of tools out there there
are already two scanning the internet so

253
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,610
why not take advantage of those results
so that we can learn about what the

254
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,229
attackers infrastructures so
traditionally I think most people here

255
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,230
have heard of showed in awesome

256
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:11,820
awesome stuff they're just put in IP in
get tons of information associated with

257
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,158
it reports that are open for each one of
those you have banners

258
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,799
lot of good stuff in academic realm
there's something called it I heard

259
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,129
about it recently but it's it's called
center style that another resource you

260
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,860
may want to check out in this was
released like a few years back on April

261
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,449
four years ago was called punks player
to work continues on that and that's

262
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:46,190
focusing on web applications so for
websites it'll go and you know scandal

263
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,740
website and determine what some of the
basic

264
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,380
vulnerabilities associated with it are
or if it's good and then just turn it in

265
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,110
there you know just kind of old school
you know the cross you know what what

266
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,668
what's a site running if you want to
learn more about it see then add the

267
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:07,769
medicine it's great to virustotal
obviously you know it started out where

268
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:13,090
you could just make files in the net
file scan by Lake 38 the engines but

269
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,139
it's really evolved into you are able
you can do the same thing you can see me

270
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:22,820
URLs to it you can search for it you can
search for houses there's even I don't

271
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,120
know who they're working with but they
even though they seem to be doing

272
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:34,918
behavioral analysis to use if you submit
a file through one of its partners in a

273
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:42,679
pool in some behavioral analysis sort of
a detonation and in what that did too

274
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,539
passive total as a name you know this is
kind of your passive way to learn as

275
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:50,139
much information as possible

276
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:55,219
it started out as being more of a passes
DNS type service where you could search

277
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,539
and it was free but now they've gone
commercial but they were like the

278
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:05,779
average user like you get I don't like
50 free quarries per day so

279
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:20,410
ok yes so if you're a researcher you can
email them and they made you up to now

280
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,260
they start out with massive DNS but
they're also pulling in a lot of other

281
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:30,270
good stuff to you so excellent site to
check out in the crowd crowd which is a

282
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:36,870
crowd-sourced say they have put in IP an
indoor pool in some information about

283
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:44,250
that in in from various resources so
that you can get a better understanding

284
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,960
of that it has a school where a kind of
graph where you'll have your IP in the

285
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,310
middle you can click on it and you can
pivot around and stuff it looks really

286
00:28:53,310 --> 00:29:01,639
cool but to be honest I would rather
write it down on the notepad next to my

287
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:10,280
keyboard way but it's kind of course for
you know management right to sue the

288
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,950
third

289
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,960
the other the last mean component of the
environment here is simply store this

290
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,510
off so you know a central place to pull
out all the stuff into one place so the

291
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,900
sources include obviously your sensor
alerts blogs and stuff from all your

292
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,960
different supporting resources and
external resources here but it just

293
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,490
Steve like I would just wouldn't come
tons of external stuff and I would find

294
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,240
this stuff that most useful for you and
maybe keep that in any event for the

295
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,940
rest of the stuff you adjust to life
searches so whatever this device is you

296
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,420
can figure it to show alerts you know if
it's the same type of thing maybe you

297
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:58,760
can correlate multiple alerts together
to to make it to increase the alert

298
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,320
fidelity by so there's two aspects there
there's kind of like your pearson's

299
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,500
which are things like art say it or you
know tons of other ones that are out

300
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,480
there but you know just to get started

301
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,659
Ely involved you know it's based on open
source so you can start out with that

302
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:25,159
in then they have a commercial there's a
whole bunch of them out there if you

303
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:30,609
wanna do you know how to categorize it
but more like adaptions so you know is

304
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:36,460
you know more of just a great place to
display all your logs in but you know

305
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,389
they've written modules so that you can
have sort of an older teen you know it

306
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:47,258
doesn t correlation as well but I don't
personally like I see money going and

307
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,919
invest money in in all these expensive
seems they can do

308
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:58,479
correlation but then like no endeavor
using it so so that's a situation you

309
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:04,580
can go something like that and it's free
for up to a certain amount of data if

310
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:10,859
you just wanna check it out of Splunk in
if you wanna go open source search the

311
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:17,928
technology to go it is probably more of
the stock so it isn't that bad to set up

312
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:19,349
its pretty clean

313
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:26,889
takes a few minutes he even I did it so
putting her big picture together it

314
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:30,539
looks something like this where you have
the year you know the blue says we're

315
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:35,940
all your house estate is pulled together
maybe you have you know like your log

316
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,159
collector there and maybe you're logged
collector is acting as your central

317
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,789
place design alerts or maybe you have a
system that doing that and then you have

318
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:52,119
your analyst workstation so you're
usually in you know you usually have

319
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:59,418
having some sort of in in point security
solutions so you know just your

320
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:06,330
traditional AV kids whatever is out
there in this survey on you know you

321
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,739
basically have the same thing but but
agents are you know more focused on

322
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:18,989
doing server stuff and you definitely
have you like all these green things are

323
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:23,509
the data associated with those you know
you have there's logs there and you can

324
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:29,320
use that as a supporting resource
something with your router so having

325
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,460
some sort of the network intrusion
device you know you can place that

326
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,089
wherever depending on what your strategy
is but you know here I just stayed

327
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:45,499
behind the firewall and you have your
firewall logs in and you maybe have like

328
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,489
your web server logs in your email

329
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:51,629
you know and you may have agents on news
machines as well

330
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:56,639
your full packet capture sitting where
ever you know if you just turn out maybe

331
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:02,619
just capture for a limited time from
sitting on the outside maybe you wanna

332
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:07,949
concerns do you do that to the Indian
side and if you get real mature maybe

333
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,049
you have full packet capture on each of
the different way and they're so the

334
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:17,649
agency in early in traffic and then when
you have your stuff that you can get

335
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:22,488
externally such as all the stuff like
Google who is tough

336
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:30,919
etcetera so so where to start out here
it's so integrated environment you can

337
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,809
kind of start with is you know it's been
around for a few years now that works

338
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:39,678
without security onion it continues to
evolve mean this definitely isn't

339
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,149
something that you want to work on the
UN using a big enterprise but if you're

340
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:49,899
in a small you just starting out this is
like a great thing it's a great solution

341
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:56,879
to get going in the Indian doug has you
know he's working to try to come up with

342
00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:02,359
you know box if people could just just
by this that has all this integrated

343
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:07,559
together as well but essentially you
just need like just an old PC the winner

344
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,639
on it has various different there's
different deployment options there's

345
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,350
three

346
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,120
component and you can either have them
all in one box or you can distribute

347
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,940
them however you want essentially like
you said you see this old beige box and

348
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:29,139
needing you need some sort of a router
that supports nearing or tapping in for

349
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:35,650
this at home you know very small
environment like the nETGEAR ProSafe are

350
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:43,130
good to start with the other one that I
like is pfSense so this is essentially a

351
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:49,080
firewall distro based on Debian once
again I just had an old desktop I just

352
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,560
installed this thing

353
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,779
click a few extra Knicks in in ready to
go

354
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,610
it does all the automatic updates like I
can see like one pushing I can get it

355
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:07,020
updated it has tons of modules you can
add stuff to it you know by default it

356
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:13,800
system firewall but you can add they
they have there's a snore model in style

357
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,600
on it there's a proxy module there's
even like you can run the OpenVPN on it

358
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,420
but there's tons of stuff there it's a
very nice system they also sell it as a

359
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,500
little box I think it's like a little
negate parks etc as well as well and

360
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,750
you're helping support them to two
security onion just to break down into

361
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,340
the different components that it has
it's based on Ubuntu you from an IDS

362
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:49,210
perspective it has snort terracotta and
bro from host intrusion detection system

363
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:55,290
its support from a supporting resources
you know so it has not slowed so you can

364
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:01,040
have to being one's two big ones there
are guests in then bro has sort of a net

365
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,710
flew like their connection log so it's
natural lake in an application in

366
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,700
product protocol ugh so gross and that's
basically you know like if you don't

367
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:16,640
have your actual application logs broke
basically read all the network traffic

368
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,640
over it and creates applet lake

369
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:27,730
application like logs to that very
useful for as an example if you didn't

370
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:37,060
have any HTTP proxy it has an HTTP like
that is sort of like ittt prior H H D

371
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,869
prior to get the door but but it will
produce you know web server type blogs

372
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:49,829
were male type blogs so it's a nice
in-between between just an FYI which is

373
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:55,290
purely the lake just networks based on
the 52 balls and for packet capture and

374
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:59,589
so a lot of times you know instead of
having a beautiful packet capture you

375
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:04,540
can just looking at slow and look at
your bro application logs in in in

376
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,310
really have a good understanding of it
is something I have to worry about were

377
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:13,420
not and you don't even need to jump to
the full package then from an analysis

378
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:21,490
point you have it has various interfaces
so there is can even read in almost 30

379
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:34,810
square in another 10 snore my screen is
a little messed up here or I'm getting

380
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:41,560
old and need to get new glasses but
whatever so just various interfaces for

381
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,390
looking at all the traffic that is being
deducted by the Centers it has the same

382
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,390
sort of water with the elsa

383
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,500
Henderson miscellaneous stuff they're
such from an analyst perspective such as

384
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,210
network minor in Wireshark and its
linux-based so it has like all the other

385
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,250
cool things you can do with it to see
you can login and you know parse through

386
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:10,680
logs me nearly as well as I said there
are there are various deployment options

387
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,490
so you can either just have the box is
you know all three components together

388
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:20,689
just sitting one place in just watching
it there but if you put if you're

389
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,930
pushing it out you're probably in a
separate out your sensor to where you

390
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,868
want it to be in then you can have a
server that is probably inside your

391
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:33,039
network somewhere so the center of seeds
the server in then there's a

392
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,410
console aspect to it which is what the
analysts would be working at day today

393
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:45,989
right so so we had like this environment
in which I know what it is but the next

394
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:49,589
question is you how do we do it right
and so does trying to go into the

395
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:56,089
methodology here so the first phase is
is your selection phase which I talked

396
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:59,599
about and essentially you know like we
talked about earlier to choose an alert

397
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,359
tu esta gate organizations may already
have a process or a priority like this

398
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,549
setup so you know one method which I
have it there as rate is usually hey

399
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:14,269
maybe you know high priority based on
vendor cigs you know any custom

400
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,269
signatures would be the next priority

401
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:21,209
you know and then you get down to you I
think this gentleman talked where you

402
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:26,299
would look at you know you would group
alert and do counts he can group them on

403
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:34,130
alert type you can also group than in
other ways such such as on the target IP

404
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:43,809
the victim the attacker I do the same
thing with ports to you so you can look

405
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:48,939
at it the data in different ways where
you have a lot of hits you know you

406
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:53,749
probably need to talk to your sensor
admin to look at that and in figure out

407
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:58,968
how we can make this signatures more
haven't worn the deputy but where you

408
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:02,359
have just a few hits you know those
maybe things that you may want to

409
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,390
investigate further

410
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:12,689
so then maybe you would go after that
you would maybe over the vendor says

411
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:16,739
this is medium alert maybe you would hit
that and if you can get through them all

412
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:22,099
you know then you can go all the way
down to you to whatever the little ones

413
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:26,219
are business people can't get through
them all so you know tips here if you're

414
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:30,159
just starting out you know don't you
pick so I worked in environments where

415
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:34,439
the ABC the CRA will your performances
based on the number of our search

416
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:38,709
incident reports that you put out and
you know and so people to cherry pick

417
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:42,839
the easy ones they put all these things
out and then write you know that's not

418
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,670
good you know you're not only

419
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,700
any first of all you're cheating
yourself especially if you're starting

420
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,259
out because you're not learning and
you're also cheating near organization

421
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,000
'cause there may be more you know more
threatening alerts that need

422
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:03,349
investigation and also you know if there
are a lot of alerts the always are

423
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:06,770
seeing its false positives you know work
closely with the sensor admins to you

424
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:12,799
you know really add more ability to
those signatures or you know get them to

425
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:17,089
turn them off because you know the more
stuff we have to go through the harder

426
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:22,828
it is to find so so the second phase was
triage into this is where you're going

427
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:27,369
to examine the details of whatever
alerts you selected find out why it

428
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:33,140
fired so here are you gonna start out
with you know if you're in assume you're

429
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,210
gonna

430
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,640
you may start out in a similar look at
all the data that was passed to the same

431
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,700
you may look at other within the send
you may look at rival what else what

432
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,279
other alerts

433
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,980
do we have with him with his target IP
or this attacker I P or maybe this alert

434
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:59,089
type until there's a lot of stuff we can
determine there or you may kinda dive

435
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:03,589
down into the source that generated the
alerts and maybe your ideas he would go

436
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:10,109
into higher and you look at the alert
and you look at the signature and

437
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:14,339
usually there's the write-ups hey check
out this link goes you know this

438
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,000
particular attack and especially if
you're new like you definitely want to

439
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,609
go and read those in turn them in and
make sense of it usually in the sensors

440
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:28,339
you're going to have the least some
snapshot of what the pcap looked like of

441
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:31,980
what it alerted on to you can actually
look at the peak out there and make a

442
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,240
quick determination if this was like a
secret document that was being sent over

443
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,328
the over the network or if it was just
somebody that used the word secret in an

444
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:46,339
email so but eventually you know all
this stuff you get to the point where

445
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:51,319
where you want to compare it with the
prior knowledge you know in the big step

446
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:55,339
here is to save time I think the
military term is you know force

447
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:55,970
multiplier

448
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:00,689
but he basically interview doing an
investigation from scratches somebody

449
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,510
didn't

450
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:06,190
investigation similar you can go back
and kind of do a lot of stuff based on

451
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,470
Lake Skip Bo lot of steps based on their
works he can go through your analysis

452
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,890
faster and so I'm not only talking about
incident reports were formally written

453
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,980
up but if there's a way that you know
the organization in like anything you

454
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,560
investigate even if it's a false
positive or it's a it's not relevant to

455
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,170
your organization in like even having a
database of those two things available

456
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:34,200
to is very useful so that you can go to
that internal knowledge so that you can

457
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:42,540
look at events go through of the that's
more efficiently so here is and I wasn't

458
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:47,750
sure to put this step in a tree I step
of the analysis phase but really so

459
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:54,730
looking at basic source destination IP's
just you know like I said if it's you

460
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:59,680
know it's a Linux attack on a on a web
server you know probably something you

461
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,660
not to worry about but if you get it
looks good in in in need to go to the

462
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:13,069
third third step that's where you jump
to the analyzed step into this is where

463
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,390
you really can't cut into all those
supporting resources that he's been

464
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:21,480
gathering data data from in based on
what you've gathered so far which are

465
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,500
usually indicators new search through
all the relevant resources you know and

466
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,930
learn as much as you can about those now
and then you're gonna be pivoting

467
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:37,270
authors because from one indicator you
will find maybe in IP in then you're

468
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,089
investigate dad and then you'll see
you'll find another internal he that

469
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:45,759
maybe like an attacker pivoted to so
you'll be pivoting around

470
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,870
doing fun stuff like that so this is
like I don't know what to call it but

471
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:55,720
everybody's coming up with with chains
you know so I just called this the cycle

472
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,819
so I was trying to come up with like a
unique analysis and wants a step but in

473
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:09,310
in analysis component to show people how
to do it and so I came up with this like

474
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,650
indicator analysis cycle so you
basically like there's usually some sort

475
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:18,620
of a stimulus which is in in in you
determine you know you would determine

476
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,950
what the indicators are searching
knowledge base to learn as much as you

477
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,319
can about it

478
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:32,330
determine where in auto logs they have
you can go look for it so you gonna call

479
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:36,299
you that methodology and then you get to
the final phase where you're going to

480
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,150
document the results that in some sort
of a knowledge base and then you have

481
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,450
two options while could that indicator
mediocre in another log well hey I'm

482
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,680
gonna go there and check that out to you
or you may get through this whole

483
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,839
process in this is where you at I
started out with IPA and oh my god I

484
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,310
discovered like IDP might be infected
too so you essentially destroyed the

485
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:03,830
process over again in in in in it sort
of comes up and it looks something like

486
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:09,470
this iterative process and eventually
you can get you all the announces that

487
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,279
you need to do and things start to fall
back in in your done obviously I think

488
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,010
most analysts don't have enough time to
Lake come through like follow this

489
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:24,410
process all the way through the end so
so that's where you come up with

490
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:28,319
different philosophies you know it's
it's really know the basic premise here

491
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:34,580
is to hypothesize based on what you know
what the attacker could you and then

492
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,660
look for evidence associated with that
you are a few different ways of doing

493
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,930
that and then you can use timeline
announces to kindly lay things out put

494
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:49,359
in place a lot of the intelligence
frameworks out there you can use those

495
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,340
too

496
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:57,130
rate is in a disease in attacker in I
detected them in the internal affairs

497
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:04,110
you know if I work backwards you know I
need to find the exploit delivery

498
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,460
cetera and then maybe work forward to
you so in there is other in there's a

499
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,280
bunch of different interference out
there I won't mention any but basically

500
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,580
just go out into the one that works for
you and if none of them work for you

501
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:26,380
discreet just create your own and start
working with it so we had to learn more

502
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:40,570
so there is Jack it's his twitter is on
the screen here J I think I miss me yet

503
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,570
its way

504
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,530
oh yeah jackson are sorry but yeah you
can check him out

505
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,190
follow him on Twitter but he came up
with his blog post where he was doing a

506
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:59,120
training plan for the analyst and he is
very high level and so I used in this is

507
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,450
a few years back and I use that in some
of the training that I put together two

508
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,770
but basically you know some fundamental
stuff that you definitely want to learn

509
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:12,350
up on you if you wanna get if you want
to become an injured in this field is

510
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,400
you know so the first one is links you
know the great thing about Linux is all

511
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,280
your analysis tools that you need are
built in right and you doing command

512
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,730
line stuff so you can definitely it's
harder but you can definitely take

513
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:28,490
analysis deeper into you more advanced
things we're doing is sort of like you

514
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:34,879
can only take analysis so far news hits
were to the limit so I just looks like

515
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,680
some Linux me don't need to be like a
Linux guru you just need to know some

516
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,660
basic stuff you know just how did you
listening make directories changer on

517
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:50,220
how to get help rate because that's when
you can do that and to learn new things

518
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,140
intermediate you know being able to use
things like grow up and we're counting

519
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:01,600
stuff 22 gay gather basic stats strings
is also a big depending on what you're

520
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,180
doing

521
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,839
operators for directing your output or
for meeting output in and directing it

522
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,580
out and also putting different
communities together so you can you

523
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,360
really advanced cool stuff and then
advanced stuff you know where you start

524
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:19,020
doing more statistical type stuff for
you can do it so can cut xargs home

525
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,210
until like regular expressions are
awesome for being able to find stuff in

526
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,530
in in in in learning some some of the
scripting languages like you know aux

527
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:34,660
said you're just doing basic parsing
data bash you know just learning that in

528
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,910
in in Python speak to

529
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:42,170
so the other fundamental is networking
basics just understand the basic

530
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:48,849
networking contacts you know the whole
tcp/ip stack on important but also

531
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:52,910
understand what it looks like you know
don't understand what the TCP handshake

532
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:58,348
is understand you know what in HTTP
session looks like after that one in SSL

533
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:02,880
session looks like exeter so really you
know be able to bring these things up in

534
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,289
Wireshark and be able to just quickly
identify them

535
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:14,730
0 gap analysis you know you are already
talked about Wireshark just being able

536
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:20,539
to use that tool as as much as possible
and also would like to remind stuff i

537
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:23,490
mean there's no t-shirt which is the
command line version of Wireshark

538
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:28,919
there's also a tcpdump then there's also
a lot of Lake interesting tools that are

539
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,630
in Linux by default lake Lake little
scripts that will automatically go

540
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,829
through and pull out

541
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:41,760
attachments or or you can do regular
expressions searches through the binary

542
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:50,029
teacup like just lots of cool stuff
there and then flow analysis so you know

543
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:55,119
basically understand that how you can
use it you know I talked about what that

544
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,059
was the tools you know it's kind of a
big houses framework but like I said if

545
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:07,119
you can use you know security onion and
you can learn our guests in my mind so

546
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,289
it's not as fun but but you can only
carve up the data and grab some

547
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:18,010
interesting stuff so the final part is
loud analysis and so on the network side

548
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,079
this is just understanding I mean you're
going to be an expert but just

549
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:24,910
understanding the basics of all the
different laws that are out there you

550
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:28,828
know and then being able to google the
rest if you need to dive in two more

551
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:35,000
details so have you know proxy log your
firewall logs in certain critical in the

552
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,750
same thing on host you know most of us
are you most enterprises or Windows so

553
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,359
you have all your Windows logs

554
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:47,069
endpoint security solutions so being
able to pull this off

555
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:53,270
pull this off of the management server
associated with them and like I said you

556
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,839
don't have to be like a super expert in
all these but you need to know the

557
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:02,869
basics and just be able to use Google
very well so there is no where to learn

558
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:08,630
more so training dot info I'm a big fan
of them and they have a whole kind of

559
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,640
school of stock type thing so there's a
lot of good stuff they're just kind of

560
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:19,180
point out there's some of the act of
classes that they have now are the ones

561
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,520
at the top there flow analysis in
network honey introduction in network

562
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,740
forensics analysis network

563
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:32,339
ironing out of those they have videos
that are recreated the have labs with

564
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:37,509
the NZ you can download because you can
download and then slides too so it's a

565
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,710
great resource that people are sort of
like open knowledge that people are

566
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:46,910
publishing stuff there for training and
certifications I mean if you can do

567
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:52,839
scenes you know the G CIA in the DCI
agers are really good if you're in the

568
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:58,538
federal space Daytona specify those to
see answered they also the CH which you

569
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:04,020
know not really sure about that but I
guess somebody pay them enough money in

570
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,569
a vendor search too so you know if the
company that you're working for uses

571
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:14,049
arcs a tour like new nitro or involved
or whatever there's training usually

572
00:53:14,049 --> 00:53:18,700
associated with all those tools in same
thing with your center still in Doug

573
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,660
Burks has a security onion course but if
you want to stick with the open

574
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,328
platforms

575
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:28,609
he goes by like once a month so
definitely take his course I think he

576
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:31,609
just think he just finished one this
week

577
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:41,399
defensive challenge is so definitely
where I learned a lot just there there

578
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,940
were these things called cyber quest a
while back and they're still doing them

579
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,539
being there for high school students
behavior just learning it you just get

580
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:53,549
on in and learn as much as possible so
you get key caps in memory dumps and

581
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:58,640
then you can basically do analysis on
that but you know just you know just

582
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,000
some top one that I reckon dinner I mean
there's tons of fun out there but

583
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,779
there's an hour traffic analysis dotnet
so dead deafening check out his

584
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:11,650
challenges he does like one per month
and then a person challenge out and then

585
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:16,940
he puts into a week later or you can
submit for it I think he went something

586
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,819
and also there's an old saying cultural
stormed out or capture the flag

587
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:27,649
repo and so it does it tries to capture
a lot of the capture the flag from all

588
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:32,089
the different kinds over the years even
grab the artifacts the questions in

589
00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:35,520
doing on your own and there's lots of
other stuff there and there's many many

590
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,369
others so just check that out and just
kind of close things out you know what

591
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:46,890
what now you know if you're interested
you know even if you're doing this now

592
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:51,230
first thing you should do is set up
security at home and start investigating

593
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,569
stuff that's going on in your local
traffic kinda talked about the cherry

594
00:54:55,569 --> 00:55:02,009
picking things where make sure if it's
your getting tons of irrelevant alerts

595
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:06,900
make sure to work with us in admin so
that you can tweak those to make them

596
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,690
better or disable them never touch
adversary infrastructure if that's your

597
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:17,099
thing you know you may be in an industry
where are you don't worry about that in

598
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:22,539
the last thing is to you know know your
network and your spurred interest in

599
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:26,250
your infrastructure inside out and he
knows it defender that's the only

600
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:30,559
advantage we have you know I meet
analyst after endless endless that just

601
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,859
has no idea there just like I don't know
the sensor alert pops up and I do this

602
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:39,029
you know where that Senser said you know
what

603
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:45,020
what do what other device is following
that network path you could investigate

604
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:49,190
into learn more about the attack you
know and knowing your infrastructure

605
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:54,370
where your sensors are where you have
logging devices allows you to easily

606
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:59,700
direct your analysis and I i guess im
just gonna take questions after the word

607
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,410
afterwards I never finish early just FYI

608
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:09,569
but I do want to take i doing a big just
give a shoutout noak on this is the

609

second time that I've been here I was
