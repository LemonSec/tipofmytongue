1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370
you don't know what the hell you doing
so hopefully things work out my name is

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,730
Rob if anybody needs anything you can
ask for me or PC anybody around with the

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:14,950
redshirt any richer and richer but staff
and it can help you with anything

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,320
finding things getting drinks and
speaking of drinks but it'll be

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,100
important part first there will be a bar
set up in the hallway starting at two

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,330
o'clock I think everybody should have
gotten the drink talking on the way in

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,789
that's good for one free drink and then
sponsors will have a drink tokens that

8
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,550
they can give out at their discretion we
don't know that yet so it's like you're

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,140
beginning to an end to be still be a
cash bar slashed open bar

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,950
up until 667 it is a full bar happy hour
and that's being sponsored this year by

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,329
ground to cover some of that so and it's
all good do stuff tomorrow we'll have a

12
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:59,809
bar running most of the day as well kind
of the same setup is that so you look up

13
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,070
the rules that are in the book I don't
really feel like reading all the rules

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,619
but you know basically be nice to each
other speakers it's pretty hard to get

15
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,950
up here for a lot of people I think at
first because they're having a cocktail

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,080
right now getting ready to get up here
so it's it's not easy for everybody in

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,520
there during their time so please be
nice but on the same front for free to

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,000
ask questions

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,780
most speakers are more than happy to
answer questions so definitely is I'm at

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,100
this point we don't care either one to
point out that a little bit different

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,500
from some places is it gonna take photos
that's totally fine we do ask that you

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,670
can check with anybody in that photo
though they're OK without some people

23
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,070
don't really want to be seen it

24
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,408
non-official events or don't want you
presence out there too much self Mr

25
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:53,120
quick menu in the frame double check
their cool with it and that's most of it

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,640
ruling in about 15 minutes with the
first talked to be in this room by Jim

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,360
