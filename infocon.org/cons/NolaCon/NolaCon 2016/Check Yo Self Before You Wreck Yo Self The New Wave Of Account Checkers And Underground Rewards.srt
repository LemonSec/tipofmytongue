1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
please help yourself out there coming up
next we have been here brown talking

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,320
while he's in the talks are continuing
to talk about 2:30 repetitive please

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,660
check out this ETF's be a great prizes
and actually it's really worth competing

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,070
out there are some pretty nice compact
by Vincent like that so check it out in

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:31,210
a good night everybody this talk is
taking a look at account checkers are

6
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,860
counted offers reusing credentials to
across websites to gain access to

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:44,480
accounts and then looking at how profit
is made out of that so little bit about

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,239
myself I work for Akamai Technologies I
focus mostly on darknet cybercrime

9
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,849
research I also do I our stuff both
internally and for customers who are

10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,980
being attacked I also do a number of
security trainings and workshops

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,559
including things like technical incident
management stuff like that

12
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,619
also our team gets to do some fun stuff
that sort of chaos monkey work we get to

13
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:15,700
make our other be used and teams upset
because we break their stuff which is a

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,000
lot of fun so pretty much the four main
sections of the stalker new be talking

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,990
about some real-life incident response
with these account checker gangs looking

16
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,179
at some of the tools that they use and
then looking at the darknet markets that

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,460
and the rewards fraud that's related to
these account checker gangs and then

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:43,429
looking at how they might longer some of
their ill-gotten goods so what we saw

19
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,070
last year and this year with the
activities with the account checkers is

20
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,158
it was a cross-industry it wasn't just
focus on one industry the three biggest

21
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,820
ones where retail travel and hospitality
and we saw a lot of focus on accounts

22
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:08,190
that have a rewards program or system in
place and the type of traffic that we

23
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,350
saw was coming a lot from botnets and

24
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,100
tools that were using rolling proxies we
saw a bunch of Jolla VPN IP's we saw

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,470
some mac botnet stuff we saw a lot of
shared hosting and we saw a lot of home

26
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,510
routers which was really interesting
this year a change from last year we're

27
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,000
starting to see some IOT devices as well
in the mix which is really cool we'll

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,020
have a research paper coming out on that
more specifically later in the year so

29
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,010
the actual activity that we saw we would
see them run for about 12 hours straight

30
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,209
and then it would suddenly cut off and
be dead for a while and then 12 hours

31
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,250
straight men cut off and be dead for
awhile we also saw that these 12 hour

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,900
blocks did not coincide very much with
WS working hours that's just a single

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,040
data point you can't really make a whole
lot of assumptions around that but

34
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,640
within the context it is useful data we
saw that they adapted very quickly to

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,320
you both

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,549
when we put in geo blocks for IP's and
then also when we were serving up 403

37
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,550
errors to their traffic some of the
measures that we found where semi

38
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,230
effective against these account checker
gangs where block blacklisting whole IP

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,690
blocks and putting rate controls on
logon urals or login API's things like

40
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:39,790
that and also checking for valid refers
especially the lower level attackers

41
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,530
they would use tools that didn't have a
lab refers and them where they didn't

42
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:52,150
craft them properly and we could flag on
those we did find some some tactics that

43
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,840
were really effective against these
gangs adding additional login info to

44
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,670
the logon sites really screwed up their
automated idea of what the website

45
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,200
should look like foreign logins so
asking for more information like a last

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,530
name or something like that was
effective for a while also updating

47
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,060
mobile in API login logic to be as
robust as the main website slogan

48
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,760
functionality a lot of times when you
look at a website that has accounts and

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,450
then you look at their API is or their
mobile loggins

50
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:30,780
it's a lot simpler also we found that a
lot of companies had legacy login pass

51
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,559
that they didn't even know where there
that we're getting targeted so that was

52
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,740
really interesting so new king those
helped a lot

53
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,340
also instead of blocking the attacker
traffic when we started targeting and

54
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,599
long routing their requests because we
could just move it around the globe to

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,710
make it take forever then that was
really effective too because then their

56
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,640
scripts were just hanging instead of
going on to the next set of credentials

57
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,870
and then something that I thought was
really funny some of our customers opted

58
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,940
to take this advice and started serving
up to

59
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,590
known attacker IP's fake you've been
successfully logged in landing pages

60
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,919
that were cashed so what would happen is
the tax credits I hate this control is

61
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,320
valid when it wasn't and then they would
move on to the next acquittals hey it's

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,710
valid when it wasn't so it gave the
attackers a lot of bad information and

63
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,750
I'm sure piss them off so in looking at
some of the tools

64
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,630
there's a bunch of account checkers just
like web based and pretty simple

65
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,430
here's one that's active right now that
allows you to check Walmart accounts

66
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,730
would put in the username or email
address and then a pipe and then the

67
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,510
password and then you just list them all
there and you can change what you're

68
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:50,750
doing eliminating between the login name
and the password you can also say how

69
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,840
many passwords you a check per user name
and then you can automatically have it

70
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,690
scraping get information about the
account using this this web script you

71
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:11,140
can also add a whole bunch of proxies
over on the right screen another one i

72
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,280
saw this one was specifically for PayPal
that's the PayPal private checker

73
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:24,760
the PayPal free prev at checker auto
spelling error this one is you know

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,219
looks a little more but it's essentially
the same functionality as the the

75
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,710
Walmart one

76
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,180
there are also some ones you can
download locally to use if you're going

77
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,860
to be doing account checking I would
highly suggest you do this because

78
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,560
they're all backboard if you're doing
research then of course you know have

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,120
your sandbox have your p.m. and look at
the interesting traffic to see where

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,270
it's calling back but here's one for
checking Netflix accounts and you know

81
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,039
it's very simple again it tells you
which ones are working or not working

82
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,660
this one does not have proxy support and
then here's one for checking League of

83
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,420
Legends accounts gaining access to those
again very simple tells you that if it

84
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,660
was successful or not and just username
and password again this one does not

85
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,310
have support for proxies so one of the
more advanced pieces of software we saw

86
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:29,090
in use what's called sentry MBA and what
this is its core program for account

87
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,130
checking account stuffing and then it
has a whole bunch of control

88
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,590
configurations that you can either
purchase or download from others that

89
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,080
are known good configurations for
different websites Loggins and then you

90
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,760
just load those into century MBA some of
the features of the latest version that

91
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,320
i've seen

92
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,820
is it has proxy support for a whole
bunch of proxies are you can also type

93
00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:00,730
in updating proxies so a website or a
private proxy tracker can look into that

94
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,450
and constantly updated its own proxies
there's also a proxy debugger to see

95
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,800
what's going on why it's being slow
things like that there's also an HTTP

96
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,400
and URL debugger for the logins and the
latest version had something new that

97
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,830
was really interesting it has OCR for
trying to solve captures automatically

98
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,560
which at that doesn't work on the more
advanced recapture but it does work for

99
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,630
the simple capture solutions also it has
browser fingerprints briefing so you can

100
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,679
pretend you're a different browser on a
different machine also you can spoof

101
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:43,559
reefer headers and you can customize
your user agents so here's what the

102
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,079
default request headers for the probe

103
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,540
looks like and that's the order that
there and it's really simple and a lot

104
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,680
of people who use this program don't
change them so that's good too

105
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,979
to look for in your traffic logs also
the default user agents and you guys can

106
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,900
get access to the slides that's hard to
read but yeah checking your logs for

107
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,699
these is is always a good thing because
a lot of people do not again change the

108
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,680
default user agent strings when the
user's program in fact one of the places

109
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,670
you can download this program in the
forum post it specifically says do not

110
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,170
modify the headers unless you really
know what you're doing so they're

111
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:32,199
essentially making people diamond which
is great because their cities so let's

112
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,750
take a look at the tool this is version
1.5 and that's the latest version and

113
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,350
you can see here it has all the
different settings that you can check

114
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,230
you can change the username and password
with the combination looks like and how

115
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,010
you thought it you can also set timeouts
and delays to try and get under the

116
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:58,540
radar of either load balancers or people
who are trying to limit how often a

117
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,290
certain IP or set of IP's is contacting
them so rate limiting you can also load

118
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:12,719
in snapshots of known good sessions for
this program which is useful and here is

119
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,130
what the proxy list looks like and you
can load you know batches of proxies or

120
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:27,660
you can use you can look in on updating
proxies and here's the the area that a

121
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,319
lot of people who use this don't even
use this is where you can customize the

122
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,950
request header and user agent strings
which you know is a really cool feature

123
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,580
but again a lot of people don't actually
use it so I do want to point out that

124
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,260
those where the simpler stuffers and
checkers and there are some larger

125
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,210
organized crime groups that are also
doing account checking and they use more

126
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,430
sophisticated programs and scripts and
they tend to leverage botnets and

127
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,229
private prop

128
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:04,290
cheese and some public proxies alright
so I wanted to find out you know why

129
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,300
they were doing this and be like what
what sort of profit model do they have

130
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,370
in mind here how do they get these
vouchers that they still from the

131
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,590
rewards programs the rewards points
themselves or the air miles

132
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,290
like what it was actually doing with
them how they turn them in the money so

133
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:27,020
I decided the first place I look is the
darknet or markets and I wanted to you

134
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,420
know narrow my scope in which markets I
looked at his there are a lot of market

135
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,750
out there now so of course wanted to
look at only active life markets with an

136
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,630
uptime greater than 95% and I wanted
popular ones so I made sure that the

137
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,600
market sideshows had Google search
impressions greater than 60,000 and

138
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,010
Google keywords greater than a hundred
so that led meets you out of a dream

139
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,850
market and nucleus market which at the
time a few months ago was the largest

140
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,770
three markets now as a month and a half
ago nucleus market has disappeared

141
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:09,310
it looks like it was an exit scam but
nobody knows for sure right now so I did

142
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,640
a a cursory look to see if there were
actually rewards fraud related stuff on

143
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,460
on these markets and sure enough there
was there were lots of vouchers for you

144
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:27,410
know food places for spas and resorts
and there where trainee vouchers and

145
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,620
tickets for sale

146
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,320
there are a lot of e-cards and actual
physical gift cards as well that we're

147
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,480
gotten through hijacked our hacked
rewards accounts a lot of whole foods

148
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,560
cards that was really interesting as
expecting to see more like wal-mart and

149
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,150
gaming herds but most of them were Whole
Foods and Panera there of course just

150
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,390
points and miles for sale as well you
know lots of GameStop points and

151
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:04,930
as well as a bunch of miles from mostly
European airlines and I'll talk about

152
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:15,329
why later so in terms of overall numbers
what I saw was digital goods that were

153
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,580
for sale in these markets

154
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,010
accounts now where you get cards there
where fourteen thousand one hundred and

155
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,450
eighty three unique listings for fraud
related stuff that's like credit card

156
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,460
numbers for sale bankruptcy and
personally identifiable information

157
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,570
that's fifteen thousand four hundred and
twenty six different items for sale

158
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:44,270
so for the actual just login information
itself or rewards accounts I saw twenty

159
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:50,290
different listings by seven different
vendors resulting in 2014 unique sales

160
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:57,349
for vouchers and gift cards themselves
there were 54 different listings across

161
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:05,850
13 different vendors totaling in 3136
unique sales for transferable rewards

162
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,290
points like we saw the GameStop points
sees me there were only three listings

163
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,430
across three different vendors but they
had 698 confirm sales so these three

164
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,239
vendors pretty much had the market
cornered on this and we're doing pretty

165
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,430
well now for air air miles there were
only four listings across for vendors

166
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:32,030
400 total sales this was really low so I
wanted to find out what was going on

167
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,980
here and turns out that a lot of
American Airlines within the past couple

168
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,790
of years have been responding to this
kind of fraud and really locking down

169
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,930
what the requirements are for
transferring points between accounts so

170
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:54,599
the airmiles became less fungible
commodity now the thing that really blew

171
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,650
me away that I did not expect to see was
that the largest use of all these

172
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,750
rewards accounts being pop especially
the hospitality and travel ones or

173
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,870
something criminal travel agents these
where people who would set up your

174
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,660
you know your flight your car rental
your hotel your cruise whatever using

175
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,459
stolen accounts so they were ninety
three different listings that we're

176
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,850
general listings for any of these
services there were 94 custom listings

177
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,070
were somebody asked for something
special and there were 31 different

178
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:36,000
vendors offering the service and the
sales numbers 4808 sales I mean I would

179
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,260
feel super sketch going on a trip using
this stuff but apparently people loved

180
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,230
it because the reviews were just rave
reviews across the board is crazy so in

181
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,690
contacts this was over

182
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,370
ten-month timeline that this data is
talking about so within 10 months on

183
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,980
only three of the markets they were ten
thousand seven hundred and fifty-six

184
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:05,170
fraud related sales looking at rewards
and rewards points and one of the great

185
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,579
things about hacking these accounts for
these attackers was that a lot of people

186
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,590
say their credit card information to the
rewards accounts so they can just use

187
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,930
that to buy other stuff and there's also
personal information that can be gleaned

188
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:24,010
from hacked accounts addresses phone
numbers that can then be packaged up and

189
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:30,290
sold as PII or full there's also cross
program fraud because a lot of rewards

190
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,849
programs are starting to hook up with
other rewards programs so you only have

191
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,210
two had tak 12 be able to get access to
like five other rewards programs also

192
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,950
when you're done with it you can just
sell the account itself after you've

193
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,170
either scrape the stuff off where did
what you want with it a lot of these

194
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,420
actually will tell you hey there's a
credit card attached to the account

195
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,140
still or that it has a bunch of freebies
or you know stuff that the account has

196
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,860
already bought that would make it more
valuable

197
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,679
alright so they're getting these big
ones right but they're dirty bighorns

198
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
because they're related to fraud related
sales how do they actually turn that

199
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,089
into money that they can use without
being traced so one of the first steps

200
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:22,688
that a lot of them will take is to put
it through a Bitcoin tumblr tumblr does

201
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:27,079
is it takes your bitcoins and then a
whole bunch of other people's bitcoins

202
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,610
are also using this service and then
bitcoins that the tumblr has in reserve

203
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,830
and mixes them all together and then
creates a whole bunch of different

204
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,030
wallets wallets and then transactions
and just as a whole bunch of crazy

205
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,399
transactions to obfuscate the leisure
activity and then of course they pop out

206
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,250
the bighorns to you and it's been all up
he skated in mixed up there to Onion

207
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,200
Router markets that offer mixing
services alpha band hello market I would

208
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,559
not trust either of them there are also
specifically tumbling services he licks

209
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,059
by grams is one of the most well-known
ones and Bighorn fog is arguably the

210
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:15,160
second better-known one there's also a
bit mixer in Bitcoin blender and those

211
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,990
are relatively newer pay shield is
really interesting because it is run by

212
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:27,110
a cig and I'm sure if you dealt with any
of the Bitcoin ransom deed officers

213
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,418
you're familiar with us again because
it's an anonymous email address that a

214
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:39,400
lot of blackmailers around summers will
use so how he likes itself works is you

215
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,480
can add a random delay in Sandwell
transactions if you're looking to

216
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,100
obfuscate you definitely want to have
those on I don't know why they're not on

217
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,559
by default but what that will do is it
won't just have been coins in and then

218
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:56,649
the same number of bitcoins out one
address because it's really easy to

219
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,110
trace so it'll send you know multiple
different number

220
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,090
denomination transactions to different
wallets that you have if you want and

221
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:12,220
then add random delays between those
transactions one thing to keep in mind

222
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,289
obfuscation does not equal anonymity as
much as somebody wants it so ubiquitous

223
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:22,750
anonymous it is not every transaction
that happens across the Bitcoin network

224
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,520
is public and available to anyone who
wants to look at it

225
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:34,559
a tool for looking at such a thing they
have block taint analysis and when

226
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,168
they're talking about analyzing the
taint I'm really trying not to laugh

227
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:44,120
like a middle schooler right now so what
they say the taint is is the percentage

228
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,520
of funds received by an address that can
be traced back to another address so it

229
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,049
looks at how much of a relationship or
interaction two different coin wallets

230
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,158
or addresses have between each other
when you start to add that to the

231
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,100
context of the overall transactions of
suspect address our wallets then you can

232
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,030
start to build a picture of how the
relationship models work there sometimes

233
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,539
it's easy to do it a ListView but
because humans are such visual creatures

234
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:17,240
it's usually better to do it in sort of
graphic you like this blog series and

235
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,830
other cool tool and they allow you to
look at transactions in and this sort of

236
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:28,899
manner and what you're seeing right now
is actually the outlay of the Silk Road

237
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,520
the confiscated bitcoins and by the FBI
and then when they were sold to Tim

238
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,830
Draper I T bit and a couple other folks
there's another tool that looks more

239
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:47,678
like you would be used to have use multi
go and this is Shane else's reactor

240
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
program and again it allows you to see
the relationships between different

241
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,230
wallets if you prefer more of a treeview
numerous site does that this is a really

242
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,799
cool program and it allows you to see
again the relationships and the

243
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,340
movements of different transactions of
Bitcoin so this is a really simple

244
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,879
example this is an example of one third
of

245
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,080
you know three pages of what looks like
this that is a single helix tumbling

246
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,649
transaction so when you put your big
dick tumblr it really does skate a lot

247
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,750
make it very hard to trace but of course
it's completely traceable there's a

248
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:38,670
bunch of research being done on the coin
tracing as well change at the Iowa State

249
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,970
his paper on graph-based forensic
investigation is pretty cool but I had

250
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,150
on their extracting intelligence from
the Bitcoin network over in italy that's

251
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,850
a great paper as well but to my favorite
papers right now on this is Dan affair

252
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,250
and who actually made numerous aight the
tree-based graph we saw earlier he has a

253
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,830
preliminary field guide for Bitcoin
transaction patterns and it really gives

254
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,540
you an idea of what the typical
transaction patterns on the network are

255
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,790
so you can start to notice them quicker
when you're doing pattern analysis also

256
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:17,600
Sarah Michael John I'm a total fanboy of
pretty much all her research but she has

257
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,949
a piece called a fistful of bitcoins
characterizing payments among men with

258
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,660
no names which she did she did
originally back in like 2012 but she

259
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,980
said she sent updated it this year with
new information and it's it's really

260
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,000
worth reading it so there's all this
tracing research in all these programs

261
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,880
to go ahead and find out what's going on
with biklin transactions so as somebody

262
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,730
who wants to clean your bitcoins you're
like well is there anything that I can

263
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:53,800
do there is so still transactions is
something that's being proposed right

264
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,700
now within the community and what it is
it's an implementation of diffie-hellman

265
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,650
and I'll explain it with colors being
the secrets here and set of keys so

266
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:09,480
there you have matin been that want to
trade some information and they want to

267
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,330
do it securely but of course there is
always friendly third-party observers

268
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,590
that they have to worry about so matin
been they publicly agreed to exchange

269
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,600
the color yellow

270
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,020
so of course them and anyone else
listening on the line would know that

271
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,770
they share the color yellow with each
other so matin been decided to mix their

272
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,620
private colors blue and red respectively
with the shared color creating a new

273
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:43,560
unique color mixture so of course I'm at
now has green and ben has orange so now

274
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,690
Maddon been exchanged these new colors
with each other so now they share each

275
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,910
other's mixed colors as well as the
original color and of course all three

276
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,310
of these is observed by whoever is the
third party observing now what do we do

277
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:01,250
about about that third-party well when
Madden been go to the next step to go

278
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,320
ahead and make their private keys with
the color mixture again what it does is

279
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,889
it makes it the same color format as the
has been but the third party observer

280
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:17,430
does not get that same color so matts
final color will be red + yellow + her

281
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,850
blue + yellow + red which we will the
same color men's final color will be red

282
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,169
+ yellow + blue which we call the same
color now the observer is stuck with

283
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,090
choosing between yellow + blue + yellow
+ red + yellow which is not the same

284
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,720
color or yellow + screen + orange also
not the same color so the final color is

285
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,260
a secret shared only between matin been
even if there is a third party observer

286
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:46,530
now dark while it is pretty much the
only way I know that is reporting to use

287
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,780
this right now because it's still very
much an alpha dark while it supports of

288
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,190
course these still transactions and
multi signature cooperative wallets

289
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,700
there's a mostly used for markets and
forums when they're setting up something

290
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,580
like a shop it also allows escrow which
is great as a third party you know if

291
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,330
you're doing a transaction between two
people having an escrow is nice

292
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,290
especially if it's a trusted escrow and
then they also implement coin join

293
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,070
mixing well what is quite amazing

294
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:22,149
well without coin join a typical
transaction looks like okay there's

295
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,960
twenty bitcoins Ted gets fifteen of them
and Bob gets five bitcoins back and

296
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,380
change of the twenty put in and you know

297
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,540
transaction to you have Alice putting in
10 bitcoins Carol gets her eight and

298
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,600
then Alice gets the two left over to a
corn joined us as it takes these

299
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,419
individual transactions and matches them
together into a single transaction so

300
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:52,090
obfuscates who put in one who's getting
what and how those transactions have

301
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,639
crossed paths

302
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,080
now in theory that's a great idea
because you're not being able to break

303
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,980
down and trace each individual
transaction but there are some issues

304
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,060
most of the services offering coin
mixing are centralized so that service

305
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,179
gets popped and havel center now has
full control of the coin join

306
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:17,790
transactions also it's still very much
susceptible to statistical analysis and

307
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,980
there is a tool that does just this it's
called coin joints and it finds common

308
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,360
ownership of multiple transaction input
and output groups by looking at the inn

309
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,550
going an outgoing amounts of each of the
transactions and then uses statistical

310
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,490
analysis to theorize on you know what
the transactions are individually

311
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:44,890
instead of in the coin model now dark
wall is an extreme alpha so it is not

312
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,130
stable or safe and use it with real
money only at your own risk unless

313
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,000
you're doing really shady shit then you
should definitely used are quite right

314
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,210
now because it's not stable dash
formerly known as dark wine and euro

315
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,390
coin already have automatically within
their own software networks mixing

316
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:13,490
services as just default transaction
resources now if they don't want to go

317
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:18,880
through all these alternate seized or
dealing with the very alpha dark wallet

318
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,550
or something like that to get their
money out they could just throw the

319
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,690
bitcoins onto a Bitcoin credit card and
then pull the money out and run couple

320
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,660
issues with that when they physically
take out cash there's ATM and bank

321
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,620
cameras there is other people's stuff
like that

322
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,320
also almost all of these Bitcoin credit
cards are backed by new or small Eastern

323
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,780
European financial institutes super
shady

324
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:51,350
and they have short license they pop up
and dial time another option is to

325
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:58,070
enable goods so what you can do is use
these dirty bit coins to buy you know

326
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:03,800
really high-end goods or electronics and
then turn around and sell those for cash

327
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:13,280
on you know using services like well a
pop or Craigslist or Backpage there are

328
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,100
a couple of things you can do with that
big 12 you can take this coin and

329
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:27,010
converted into precious metals or gift
cards or into money pac's Manila spivak

330
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:35,010
cards pretty much the preloaded credit
cards now the darknet markets do sell or

331
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,350
purport to sell a bunch of precious
metals here's on handsome market and

332
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:45,699
offering for pandering Pandora sterling
silver there's 10 ounce silver bars and

333
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,110
she would be here is that on all these
markets that are selling these gold and

334
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:57,810
silver and other precious metals is
right next to these listings our

335
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:05,730
listings for fake versions of them so
yeah have fun choosing deciding which

336
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:11,490
when you actually get the mail but not a
problem because just recently a lot of

337
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:16,930
the main purveyors of precious metals
and silver coins gold coins things like

338
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:23,470
that have just started accepting Bitcoin
directly so muggy in JMR arguably the

339
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:29,470
largest retailers of precious metals in
court especially in corn form but for

340
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,300
these accept Bitcoin now buying gift
cards again you can do that on the dark

341
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:42,180
web lots of Panera in whole foods and
it's a pretty hefty discount and usually

342
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,930
that's because their stolen or bought
with stolen credit card information than

343
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,830
one of the top you see is he he tells
you very emphatically that it is not

344
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,830
carded which probably means it is

345
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,200
there's also a pic when exchange
services people charged 10% fee for

346
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,559
exchanging your bitcoins and to either
moneypak or vanilla prepaid credit cards

347
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:16,259
2 percent is pretty high but that's an
option for you if you doing that or you

348
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:23,950
can convert your Bitcoin and to not so
precious materials I swear to god this

349
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,889
is a real listing for brick on the
darknet markets unfortunately guys they

350
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:39,019
only shipped to Europe so sorry you're a
lot there but yeah $15 for break that's

351
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:44,919
crazy so some of the issues with
actually dealing with any of these

352
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:49,139
tangible goods try and get your money
out is receiving and sending Sheedy

353
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:53,289
goods exposes your home or business
address that you're using for this also

354
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:58,200
if you decide to go with a P O box it
requires an idea to open their cameras

355
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,960
of course there and employees that you
have to deal with if you decide to use

356
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,019
an abandoned dropped like say a business
or somebody's home has been foreclosed

357
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:13,159
on or they're out of town for a vacation
or they've just recently abandoned house

358
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,379
you don't know if there will actually be
a delivery there you don't know the mail

359
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:23,000
will get forwarded also it looks super
fucking suspicious if nobody's supposed

360
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,289
to live there in males getting delivered
in there somebody picking it up late at

361
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:30,500
night so yeah also in all of this you
have to worry about controlled

362
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,210
deliveries controlled delivery of
controlled delivery is where a law

363
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:41,769
enforcement officer poses as a someone
that's delivering mail or packages gets

364
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:47,519
you to sign for the package and then
slaps on the cost so yeah but there's a

365
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,519
cute way around this

366
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:55,129
so this is called triangulation fraud
and its use a lot with eBay but can be

367
00:31:55,129 --> 00:32:00,000
used with tons of other platforms as
well so an unsuspecting legitimate

368
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,429
customer will go and say oh I like this
item that you've posted for sale and

369
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,740
I'll pay for it with you know my credit
card or whatever

370
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,510
and order it from you now the fraudulent
seller doesn't actually have that item

371
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,670
in stock what they're doing is they're
using their stolen credit card or

372
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:21,270
they're using their dirty bitcoins to go
ahead and buy the item that was ordered

373
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,540
and then instead of shipping it to them
and then reshaping it to the customer

374
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,470
they just ship it through the legitimate
e-commerce website directly to the

375
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:34,540
unsuspecting customer so the the
fraudster never actually touches any of

376
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,820
the goods that go to the customer now
what does that mean that means within

377
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,280
the cup start investigating this they go
to the person who bought something that

378
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,928
was stolen but with stolen stuff that
didn't even know it so that's a

379
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:56,420
violation fraud there are also another
two rather interesting ways of getting

380
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:03,840
your bitcoins into other monetary forms
one of them is scamming her in lift a

381
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,070
system called ghost writing and what you
do is you buy on the dot net forums a

382
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,010
bunch of stolen or hacked writer
accounts you can buy them both off the

383
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:19,090
dark night markets but there's also a
bunch of forms that sell them and there

384
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,389
are hacks smartphones that you can buy
as well that run multiple instances of

385
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:29,330
over / lift the driver software there
are also private forums of what are

386
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,820
called ghost dispatchers and Asia they
call them ghost nurses for some reason I

387
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,960
have no idea why but what they do is
they can inject targeted pickups that

388
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,290
aren't actual people but injected into
the software so it pops up right near

389
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:48,190
where you are as a driver they're also
custom GPS software that if you put it

390
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,770
on the drivers phone supposedly it
tricks the driving apt to think that

391
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,420
you're going along the route when you're
actually just sitting still I haven't

392
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,330
been able to get my hands on the actual
software so I can't say that that's

393
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:04,760
actually what it does but I'd like to
see that if anybody does have a sample

394
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:11,580
that software please hit me up another
cool thing you can do is win casinos so

395
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,779
they

396
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,370
they will usually give you bonuses for
depositing bitcoins and so you get you

397
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:23,560
know put your dirty bitcoins and you get
your deposit L&O all of these have like

398
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,540
reviews of what they do and how many
games they have and what they take and

399
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,940
stuff like that and the funny thing is
they tell you whether or not americans

400
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:41,168
can use the site even though it's
illegal here but also so what you do is

401
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:45,109
you to take the dirty bitcoins you turn
into chips you do a little bit low risk

402
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:49,700
gambling and then you go ahead and get
clean bitcoins out there have been mixed

403
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,600
up with all the other patrons of that
gambling site that what are some

404
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,009
problems with this local laws may just
make it that you're not only doing wire

405
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,920
fraud and money laundering

406
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,030
but now you're also he legally gambling
so charges are stacking also casinos

407
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,290
have been known to perform and exits him
once they hit a certain level of people

408
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,660
that have given them bitcoins before the
people can take their money out the site

409
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,109
will just disappear in the people run
off to Eastern Europe or something it's

410
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,670
also if the casino doesn't have a lot of
players using a lot of money there's

411
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,820
high traceability between the big ones
that go in the thick ones that come out

412
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,779
also there's a lot of wagering
requirements for the withdrawal of your

413
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,500
bitcoins they say you have to spend this
much money and bats before you can take

414
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,360
any money out there are also alternative
payment services that you can trade

415
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:51,740
between for PayPal Skrill Moneybookers
Google Wallet and then of course wiring

416
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:57,250
funds Western Union Moneygram the issue
with pretty much all of these is that

417
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:03,010
valid IDs required and they have
extended delegate validation for know

418
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:08,960
your customer laws as well as anti money
laundering laws especially the the

419
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,310
exchanges and there's also cameras you
have to deal with if you're doing a wire

420
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,310
transfer a lot of times and then
actually talking to employees or the

421
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:22,250
other customers in the office so a way
around this and I saw that was kinda

422
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,080
cute

423
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,130
was called an ATM runner scam

424
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,880
what this is is you would give your it's
not actually it's just a process for

425
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,279
cleaning money so you did your dirty
bitcoins to an individual or a business

426
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:39,480
on the dark web and they would actually
have really counts

427
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,400
hooked up to Bitcoin exchanges like
circle Columbia stars out though and

428
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,609
that would be linked to their bank
account and then a bunch of what are

429
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:52,990
called runners would go to a whole bunch
of different ATMs and pull out cash from

430
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,098
that bank account and then they would
actually physically mail you the cash to

431
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:02,539
whatever address you gave them the
downside to this is you gave some

432
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:11,279
criminals your address now so there's
that you can also do some cute scans by

433
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:14,579
doing freelance work or not actually
doing the work but saying you're going

434
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,230
to so real answer

435
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:23,220
analogy in crypto grind all accept
Bitcoin as both payment and reception of

436
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,038
funds so what you do is you set up
accounts as both somebody who needs

437
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,200
freelance work done and somebody who's
offering freelance work so you control

438
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,710
both accounts and then you just move the
money through between them using the

439
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,329
website as you were washing machine
another way that you can do this is

440
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,319
setting up your own web shop for I don't
know offering Reiki healing over the

441
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,000
Internet or something but you could set
up a square account stripe account

442
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,589
Shopify we're bringing treats you
actually receive funds again you're both

443
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:59,009
the customer and the service provider in
this instance just moving your dirty

444
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:06,460
bitcoins through their website and their
accounts so some of the guys I saw for

445
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:12,000
laundering bitcoins were particularly
evil and solace and they were talking

446
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,279
about starting your own charity and get
bonus points if you have a cell blocks

447
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:21,900
all over your website cuz that's totally
legit and they had guys for starting

448
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,700
your own church starting your own
political action committee and then you

449
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:31,069
would just under your bitcoins through
those and the really evil ones also said

450
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:34,960
the added bonus is that if you start a
charity to launder your money

451
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,140
other people might actually give you
their money for the charity

452
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:46,799
T so terrible some of the platforms that
are used for this champ PayPal PayPal

453
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:50,430
charity has its own the whole thing
there's a network for good which is a

454
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:56,200
fairly new smaller but they they do
allow a Bitcoin as well give well and I

455
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,578
are other options that I saw in the
guides for these so we we did is we

456
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:10,309
looked at thanks we looked at how they
actually get into the accounts what

457
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:15,089
types of traffic they use and the
targeting of these rewards account how

458
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:19,650
they actually make Bitcoin off of them
on these darknet markets and forums and

459
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,450
then some of the ways that they turned
that into other types of money that they

460
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:31,169
can actually use with probably not
getting caught so I'm sure I don't have

461
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:37,730
here comes to a boy I'm sure I don't
have you know all of the methods that

462
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,200
could be used to either launder the
coins or all of the defenses against

463
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,689
account checker gangs because of course
we only saw what we saw alright if you

464
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,250
all run into any of these things and
have more information or have questions

465
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,240
please please please email me as I do
love talking about all of these things

466
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:11,900
thank you and I've got I guess four
minutes for questions and comments are

467
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:19,769
usually performs but there have been
over the I would say past year or so

468
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:24,299
I've seen at least three different
listings of people that are selling

469
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:32,810
email address dumps for spamming thank
thank you

470
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:33,040
everybody
