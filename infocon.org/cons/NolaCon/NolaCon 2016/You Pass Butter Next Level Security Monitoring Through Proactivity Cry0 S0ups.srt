1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:23,500
here to test something

2
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:51,620
testing 123 getting ready to begin we
got we got a while I just like watching

3
00:01:51,620 --> 00:02:09,449
your on the left but I'm like how long
the talking to be five minutes no be an

4
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,320
appalling delayed 40 maybe maybe thirty
forty

5
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,440
usually talk fast whenever I'm nervous
so just got a text or so i cant wait

6
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:44,340
yeah actually turn the channel on this
thing yeah I read the slides and more

7
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,670
than this information personal life and
they start reading line-by-line when

8
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,708
you're here

9
00:02:49,709 --> 00:03:05,840
yes one minute we actually didn't
preparing slides it's just an episode of

10
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,390
a good morning sorry don't put it on the
radio to their continued employment

11
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:34,359
stage of alcohol probably do that
alcohol wrong I'll immediately get drunk

12
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,030
I can show you later

13
00:03:46,140 --> 00:04:13,328
welcome sir in the black cat

14
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:36,260
good good alright okay everybody so our
talk is about its network security

15
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:43,840
monitoring through proactive measures
who who was at Dave kennedy's keynote

16
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,580
this morning

17
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,800
anybody so a lot of what he would he
talked about in regards to Lake taking

18
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,380
on the attacker mentality while securing
your network we're gonna be kind of

19
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,560
alludes to what we're we're trying to
achieve here so we're gonna go real

20
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,230
quick who we are as soups this is cryo

21
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,420
I cry out i mean if you want to know
more about as you can

22
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,990
Google+ druggist down stalkers whatever
you can use whatever you learn here it a

23
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,270
try and drag us down there you go so you
can capture the flag

24
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:35,030
yeah I wasn't sources say that but so
why are we here like they've said it's

25
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,570
the security landscape changed a lot
just monitoring ideas Navy and point

26
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:46,580
logs really isn't going to cut it
anymore it's it's time-consuming there

27
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,659
it's overwhelming and you kind of need
to take a step further 22 detects

28
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,230
potential breaches raid so in order to
do that we need to kind of depth how we

29
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,500
think about three network security grade
so we have to kind of take our viewpoint

30
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,860
and view it as an attacker can obtain as
much information as we can about our

31
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,310
organization and utilize that to enhance
our network monitoring capabilities are

32
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,470
as we improve our habits are threatening
college and monitoring capabilities in

33
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,040
that way

34
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,910
the goal is to obtain action Linteau as
early on in the attack life cycle as we

35
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,010
can so that we can basically either
monitor more heavily particular IP

36
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,240
address attached to a threat or stop it
alright hopefully we'll be able to

37
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,210
impress the hell of her bosses and we
will also find as many better pictures

38
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,289
as possible cuz when I created this I
had a better finish apparently I don't

39
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,390
know why it's weird you seen working
more do you make it so again we're gonna

40
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:57,810
try and bridge the gap from a preventive
mechanism to more detective capabilities

41
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,620
and kind of merge the two together we
detects by monitoring I guess external

42
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,400
sources and stuff outside of our own
network but are again talking about is

43
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,330
great but it's also so hun teams not
sure if you are aware of fun times it is

44
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:19,370
basically organizations within your your
security department that actively scour

45
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:25,270
your own network for indicators of
compromise IOC's and in order to kind of

46
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:32,710
facility that better our goal is to come
to obtain detailed actionable and

47
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:38,460
applicable IOC's as quickly as possible
and import them into our detection

48
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:47,799
detection measures as quickly as
possible so as a call so I was in a talk

49
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,409
about the technology we

50
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:55,779
ok so as most of you probably know this
isn't allowed is it not

51
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:04,989
2010 the attacks i bowl and goes
something like gather information is

52
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:13,969
there any way inside there I'm pretty
sure most of you already know it

53
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:18,599
yeah so basically an attacker tries to
find as much about as good as you can

54
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,128
rate and then from there he fishes and
expertise whatever it takes whatever

55
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:31,559
potential holes he finds so our goal is
to basically move our monitoring

56
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,379
capabilities to the Recon enumeration is
really difficult or the fishing next

57
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,240
phase

58
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,620
early on so that we can basically
stopped in its tracks so someone is too

59
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,040
so yeah sorry for bringing obviously
there there are literally so many

60
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,439
different variations on the attack

61
00:08:53,439 --> 00:09:01,810
lifecycle my I know ASAP 2001 the
Metasploit books and other and then this

62
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,508
is another so there's three right there
but anyway I think like an attacker the

63
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,110
less you know the more you can learn

64
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,130
goes for anything really but in this
case the less you know about your

65
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:20,430
company your organization whatever it is
that you're a part of if you just

66
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,180
completely forget everything about bad

67
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,310
then you can start to look at it from a
ground-level kind of you from the bottom

68
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,869
up because of you just keep that in mind
that but oh I know about like let's say

69
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,480
thirty percent of everything about the
company or organization then you know

70
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,279
there's certain things are not going to
be as keen on researching are looking at

71
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:51,670
whereas if you just start from the
ground up just are researching in Google

72
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,060
Company Holdings Ltd and let that your
company and then think the first results

73
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,290
are starting from the very bottom and
having a definite goal in mind whenever

74
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,660
you are gathering information and you do
want to always have a goal in mind

75
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,660
whether it's looking for a particular
type of vulnerability whether it's

76
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,770
looking for a particular type of
information so like let's say you're

77
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,550
looking for my credit card numbers that
were opposed to it or maybe some other

78
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:32,290
data bus by an employee a member
whatever I'm then going you're looking

79
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,329
through you see something that looks
like it might be bad but then you

80
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,660
realize that the person you're looking
for or typing data you're looking for

81
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,660
but also there's other data they're like
let's say they're having problems with

82
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,819
simple PHP or something like that and
you know that that you know when he

83
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,510
remembers where employees will then
suddenly you can change your goal to her

84
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,569
credit cards to now I'm looking for has
this person posted anything anywhere

85
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:11,029
else that might give me a better idea of
what type of issues that they're facing

86
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,910
and the company or organization

87
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:20,110
and all that jazz also goal is
constantly changing but you always want

88
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:26,160
to have the goal in mind because that's
what you're going to be directed toward

89
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,920
letting I'm not gonna be like all I
didn't find it like in five minutes I'm

90
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,670
just giving up at like now I really want
to find information on this let me think

91
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:42,670
of other ways that I can wear this
research with the intent of gaining

92
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:49,640
entry of course any attack are looking
to gain entry into some kind of system

93
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,360
whether it's sexual training data or
whether it's just exploding it and

94
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,610
passing information gathering it is
definitely the main focus active

95
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,900
information gathering yes you can see
what Portugal you can scan Web pages you

96
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,920
can see what kind of buildings are
actually there you can see what kind of

97
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,479
exports you can do all that jazz but you
know let's say find a boner ability in a

98
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,520
page and then monitor well let's say you
like snorters well now you're monitoring

99
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:30,160
for in-store time they'll catch it but
whatever there there's something else

100
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,170
out there that shows like a what we've
got more pages here here here and here

101
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,530
then suddenly it's bypassing the store
will entire so passive information

102
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,050
gathering is much more useful because
they can show you where your weaknesses

103
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,930
lie not what your weakness years and it
can show you what kind of land from Bob

104
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:59,170
landscape but what kind of just
holistically all the information that's

105
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,209
getting how about

106
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:12,040
your company or organization know your
shift so again reiterating forget

107
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,259
everything about the company or
organization because I know from the

108
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:23,660
ground up will be a much better idea of
not only one attacker knows about the

109
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:32,009
company and expectedly but you may also
find things that you know like if you

110
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:36,889
just start like let's say you're an
accountant things about counting they

111
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,529
can get through that kind of stuff and
then find oh hey look here is a huge

112
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:52,569
thing I didn't even know about Google
yeah yeah the public resources together

113
00:13:52,569 --> 00:14:02,479
and by that I mean 90% Google and 10%
other things but you won't be as

114
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,670
discreet as possible which goes back to
passive versus active is better than

115
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,029
ever get creative with your Google
quarries don't just search company

116
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:19,569
Holdings Ltd tax bracket actually if
your website or regulation does have a

117
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:26,339
site you can use the site operator and
say there's that he said to me to you

118
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,559
know company dot com

119
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:36,660
well let's say there's accounting .
company dot com well we don't want to

120
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,270
look at anything from accounting

121
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,870
dot com dot com or if we want to just
enumerate all the subdomains we can just

122
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,910
put it minus site just like the dash

123
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:57,740
account counting counting . asterisk
because you don't want anything with

124
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,170
accounting as a sub domain and then you
can just go through those and really

125
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:09,110
filtered down early granular not only
the sub-domain that you're looking at

126
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:16,240
but also will turn out to see what kinds
of other sometime this file type is

127
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,960
another very useful one which of course
determined that the character encoding

128
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:34,550
no fault of course the others I'm sure
the goal is to basically search your

129
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,579
site and external sites for any sort of
information about your organization that

130
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,460
could potentially be used against you
rate and then you can basically use that

131
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,310
the kind of tone your monitoring
capabilities and where you're monitoring

132
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:55,349
way back scraper was the yes actually a
script that goes to the Wayback Machine

133
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:03,110
and machine is in our guys obviously
scripts internet and all the websites as

134
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,740
many as well as it can I guess in the
stores a look of it you can go in and

135
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,590
access is really cool

136
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:15,720
accepted has a robot that txt file if it
has one of those it won't even touch it

137
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,640
even if it has a huge archive everything
and the like

138
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,689
actually one thing that happens is
someone will like a domain will expire

139
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,970
pick it up an ad robot that txt so they
can't even look at historical records

140
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:40,370
anymore they're also show you this paper
actually all it takes is a domain

141
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,670
and/or sub-domain a website like it can
take company dot com accounting dot com

142
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,640
dot com or business dot dot dot
accounting . company dot com

143
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,620
actually go through and get results of
every single page that's been archived

144
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,460
under that domain or subduing that's
essentially what it doesn't just

145
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,939
produces a list of every single link
essentially ok so cool and stuff that

146
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,120
you can utilize so

147
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,349
paceman baseman in particular has helped
if you have a free account for paceman

148
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:22,688
you can actually set up alerts for any
public post any public post that

149
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:28,410
contains keywords it'll automatically
see an email on think the free license

150
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,380
like every 12 hits yet to go in and
reset it but it's pretty pretty clean

151
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,960
actually set up alerts for like your
brand name so if I want any peace been

152
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,660
posts with no luck on and it will
automatically send me an email saying

153
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,130
hey this post has no tag on another
actually discovered a lot of Thompson

154
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,880
leads for organizations that way there's
also docs post a bunch of different

155
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,260
websites deadly script kiddies always
kids you have each others and a saddle

156
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,870
again sometimes but we can utilize their
the sort of mechanism to detect maybe

157
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,590
one of your employees got their whole
life stories on the internet somewhere

158
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,520
in one of these hoes paceman poster docs
pose for their username and passwords

159
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,030
are in there you can utilize that kind
of move your monitoring capabilities to

160
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,110
kind of detect what they're doing on
your network so maybe that they could

161
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,500
utilize the personal information posted
on line to get in your network

162
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,260
we actually have the if you have a paid
account replacement is an API that you

163
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,710
can utilize and we have a piece creeper
the likely go out and whatever keyword

164
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,380
you feed it will actually go out and
grab those posts once they are posted

165
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,350
mechanism for the free counseling it it
keeps it on the website so you just

166
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,480
deleted you won't see it but the API you
can actually done pulling down quick

167
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,810
down with a locally are suspicious sale
top of current events just so you know

168
00:18:52,810 --> 00:19:02,320
what Twitter so have a couple of
channels and TweetDeck to monitor my

169
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,120
brand so if any sort of mentions my
company or their I can know what's going

170
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,580
on with the organization anybody's
talking about doing stupid stuff

171
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,970
LinkedIn is another piece been a graph
spaceman

172
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,740
leaks 10.com my goal would list the
username and password is updated pretty

173
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:36,190
regularly team stuff hearings yeah so
external pen test like you know for all

174
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:46,550
companies and security assessment
organizations can also be they can feel

175
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,750
different factors that you may have
passed up for their internal auditing

176
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,330
team may not have seen maybe the exact
opposite

177
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,090
and it's it's important just like
regular scheduled interest rate just

178
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,399
possibly the best kind of what you're
doing

179
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:09,199
researching your public sources just
kind of keeping track of what's out

180
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,859
there on your organization so you can be
mindful of what could be used against

181
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:15,199
you

182
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:23,369
yeah and then knowing the publicly
available information you actually can

183
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:28,070
you like it based on how much of the
information like what kind and how much

184
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,580
of that particular kind of information
into the in the public you can actually

185
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,099
examine that and create red herrings
allure tokens or even you know false

186
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:45,928
data and you're monitoring software
solution whatever you can actually look

187
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,539
for those very specific thing that you
create are you put out there with all

188
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:55,570
the other stuff so that it did text you
know for an absolute 100% fact if anyone

189
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:03,349
using this particular bank then its
target and targeted at us and

190
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:12,519
differentiates it from my saying like oh
but it showed on shooting or just like

191
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:20,719
an nmap and that right there

192
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:33,539
so

193
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:41,640
eighty-two percent of the risk lies at
the end points right now as opposed to

194
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,789
like forty percent of the prisoner so I
believe like fishing is a very important

195
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:54,510
detection mechanism that you can utilize
so you can monitor for special domain

196
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,070
registrations are a bunch of services
available like MarkMonitor DomainTools a

197
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,580
few wasn't there the mantles is really
awesome basically what you can do it you

198
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,860
can set up like someone to the basement
alerts that we're also talking about you

199
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,639
can set up keywords that these services
will actually monitor for its

200
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:18,779
it's geared towards brand monitoring and
infringement but you can utilize it to

201
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:23,250
basically detect any sort of suspicious
malicious domains registered targeting

202
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,450
organization so for example Noah conduct
com

203
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,440
to monitor like we can monitor can add
in in 0 le conduct common any domains

204
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:45,210
registered that match that keyword will
20 I gotcha ok so basically you'd be

205
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,500
alerted and it's really simple at least
DomainTools his election to send you a

206
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,309
daily email like a piece of the demands
that have registered that match your

207
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:59,889
keywords and you can catch a fish called
like malware site said basically copied

208
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:04,678
exact copy of your website and are used
to distribute malware like that we've

209
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:11,799
caught a phishing attempts type of
squatting type thing what you can do

210
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,049
with this information is you can set up
you can either monitored further

211
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:21,120
monetary rules for any emails inbound
from this domain you can also

212
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,430
just read a blog but things better we
can utilize URL crazy which is pretty

213
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:35,790
cool free tool in Cali that actually
will generate you type in nola.com it'll

214
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,649
generate huge list of all these
different type of these type of

215
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:45,470
squatting brand jacking Gliss wrong teal
DS and some demands and pull up this

216
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,660
huge list you can pick and choose from
that and imported into these brand

217
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,620
monitoring tools such a relief

218
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:02,719
nifty detection mechanism another really
awesome effective at times features

219
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,360
employee awareness training in
leveraging your employees to basically

220
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:15,159
reports fishing or suspicious emails and
it difficult at times during the whole

221
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,440
weariness training for these people have
different skill levels and all that but

222
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,210
there's there's a few different tools
available go fish is an open source on

223
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,580
and basically what it is is it just
allows you to construct but like

224
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,540
phishing campaigns basically so you can
set up a target audience you can do in

225
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,260
subsets of your organization and just
said to send them like phishing attempts

226
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,800
right and you can check to see who
clicks on it and you can supplement

227
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,800
training off of that but another what
you should do this though it's really

228
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,590
cool fisheries are really nice I'm to
dress them is pretty decent too but you

229
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,720
want to create a communication method of
reporting these emails you want basic

230
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,020
leverage your employee base to report
potential to you and basically you just

231
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,580
have them for jews so that they think is
bad and you can go through and review

232
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,620
and you can expect IOC's if it is
malicious and you can toss that near

233
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,129
simmer your other networks

234
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,710
monitoring tools and see if anybody else
went to the didn't report it and you can

235
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,760
potentially stop in point compromises
through that mechanism not stop

236
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,600
completely have a better chance of
detecting them

237
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:41,409
guess I don't know whatever your fishing
stuff now this one might be really

238
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,840
difficult to come to get clout with but
there's there's you can utilize

239
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,340
transport rules in Outlook Exchange to
basically insert warning messages and

240
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,439
all inbound emails right so you could
basically have a big banner at the top

241
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,300
of all in one email saying hey this is
not an internal email so be careful

242
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,879
opening attachments or clicking on links
unless you trust them completely you can

243
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,990
utilize that kind of culture better
security guy paycheck turner.com report

244
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:17,640
anything suspicious to me right that's
that's pretty cool to their hopes and

245
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,160
again all these emails that you're
gettin reported to you can go in and do

246
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,190
analysis on employees in together
compromising import than others

247
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:33,430
other systems I think Microsoft Office
disable macros adjust to the nichols

248
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:41,800
it's important for the phishing attempts
utilize my socks off

249
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:50,280
may actually make sure that paycheck
generator dot com what the actual

250
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,780
be the report everything to that guy
that guy that's it what it really is a

251
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:15,639
better security go there so so
vulnerable targets are essentially the

252
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:23,860
people that an attacker is going to want
to either attack or go after find

253
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,979
information on that they might be able
to construct more targeted phishing

254
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:37,610
campaign or just stuff like that and so
you can publish through your searches

255
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,049
that we talked about earlier Google
searches to see like what

256
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:46,200
which movie employees has like the
biggest internet presence who post the

257
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,650
most stuff on Twitter instagramers their
LinkedIn profile has them blaring is the

258
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,650
CEO of your organization

259
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:59,180
and you can basically take that and kind
of maybe focus your training on that

260
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,760
individual little bit more and
understand that they've they could

261
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,600
potentially be a more valuable target
spear phishing attempts and everything

262
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:15,419
you can import all the i mean you can
see like once you start getting a good

263
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:23,310
flow of like fishing reports in three
you're also going to basically do

264
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,950
analysis on who's reporting the most and
that could potentially mean that they

265
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,900
have their emails spread on the internet
more so than others

266
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:38,440
you can utilize leaks or stucco which is
awesome like every everyone thinks most

267
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,000
people know about the website have been
pwned dot com right mike is there

268
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,330
anybody doesn't really know what it is
your password it says all your passwords

269
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:58,490
been in this dump his email address and
yeah everything's good you're exposed or

270
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,930
they like your stuff that actually
exposed here that's all related to the

271
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:12,060
like the public releases that have
openly and the Adobe leagues major

272
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:19,480
league sources cool because it it just
makes it easy as hell to search and I

273
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,710
think there's a the feeling of you the
actual records dollar-something today

274
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,580
like $2 a day but do be

275
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:35,470
certain amount of information leaks or
stockholm like an edge and a half I've

276
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:42,970
been pwned flight except you can
actually see the day and in extreme

277
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:49,230
detail like longs and you can search for
a wild card that's crazy and you can

278
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,409
take all information and CEO this
person's been their email address thats

279
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:58,309
blossom organization they used to
register on the go karts dot com and

280
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:02,700
that was like elite and the user's
password is password matches my password

281
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,350
policy will shoot we may need to like
talk to that using it in to change the

282
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:25,709
password and monitor him or really
utilizing and it's actually been very

283
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,520
very productive in terms of results is
you know go their league source you can

284
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:39,120
search by username IP address e-mail
address first name last name and phone

285
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,760
number

286
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,090
like any of those 5:30 you know
someone's name but want to find their

287
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:48,360
email you can do that and again with all
those you can search for wild cards it's

288
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,270
crazy and by email if you want to find
some their society user names you can

289
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:59,590
find those and like let's say you know
like an employer members or an

290
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:05,760
individual's email address you don't
know anything about their and Mike likes

291
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,270
it then licked or stock com then you've
got some aliases you can start all the

292
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:17,429
way over like starting at the bottom
looking into more information about that

293
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:22,830
alias and what they've put out for each
and every areas and you can reverse

294
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,010
search that alias and league source in
Seymour email and then more user name

295
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,720
that way and that's what the bad guys
are doing they're doing that compile

296
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,690
information link

297
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:37,810
information like that and you lose that
and targeting phishing campaigns and

298
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:47,639
everything so you'd like source that's
good and in pain yes we're so I see deal

299
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:54,050
sources this is the smallest of a bunch
of different sources of potential

300
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,780
indicator compromise that you can pull a
few of them have mechanisms are evenly

301
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:04,260
extract the data easily so far more
difficult basis there they're just lists

302
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:11,540
of lists little their updated list of
malicious URL seen in phishing campaigns

303
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,560
by other organizations that have
reported it

304
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:21,570
IP addresses indy five hashes of files
militias and you can pull these lists

305
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,389
and import them into your monitoring
capabilities to monitoring software 1

306
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:33,490
team metrics whatever and just to kind
of give you a more effective data

307
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,570
sources opposed so you can also use
malware discovered your fishing

308
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,669
reporting mechanisms cuz if one person
got it was probably chance to multiple

309
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:51,310
people in your organization got the same
or similar rendition of you can detect

310
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:58,330
that in a personal connection this is
really cool I like this so like local

311
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:03,340
groups local security groups network and
share information that you that you you

312
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,350
ascertained through your daily work and
share with them because a lot of times

313
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,209
local organizations will be compromised
like your local school systems website

314
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:20,600
or the local football team's website and
other people in your organization will

315
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,629
go to that website too so and people
other organizations in your area will

316
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,810
also go to the website so if you have a
network of people around you that you

317
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,200
can share this information with and they
can share with you it makes it a lot

318
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:45,110
more productive also important legacies
is this gonna work it looks like it is

319
00:33:45,110 --> 00:34:06,090
yes we have audio from the projectors we
think we have like two months later

320
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:11,310
there was loads so threat data
integration that whole list of IOC data

321
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,279
sources and everything nice to just like
have that all automatically feed into

322
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,560
your data and in nearly

323
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,369
security

324
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:25,039
incident incident thank you

325
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,829
event management software rides just big
system that all your other network

326
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:35,980
appliances and in points and all your
logs go to so you can monitor easily and

327
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,789
you can set up correlation rules between
different events sources so if you have

328
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:44,849
all your ISEE data sources being dumped
into their you can correlate any network

329
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,970
appliance or any in point going to this
IP address we know like Peter so bad so

330
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:54,719
we gonna wait on this ip address and we
can go investigate so if there's a

331
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,328
mechanism to automatically imported
these there's a fan of a few of them do

332
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:09,990
you open source one's probably manually
so if you have to do that it's also an

333
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:15,339
integration coalition is greed make your
job easier

334
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,180
this is what is from this from a friend
simply yet haven't seen it

335
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:35,930
ok so I don't think you're putting that
last thing because to make the open

336
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,390
source intelligence things a little
easier to find me my first name last

337
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,308
name

338
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:47,150
correlation so thank you thank you for
that left your welcome

339
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:56,739
should edit this room rates quick recap
that was quicker than 30 moisture recaps

340
00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:02,469
the mindset of your adversary utilized
as many open source tools as you can and

341
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:08,989
mechanisms you can to meet us at
mechanism just over the Internet or any

342
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:15,579
sort of information on your organization
you lies that to kind of be mindful of

343
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:21,019
where an attacker could potentially
break in your organization with that

344
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:27,930
information was available yes money
relevant domain registrations very

345
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:37,319
helpful during your police there your
life on the fish yes special characters

346
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:44,009
he's news and info have a target
supporter of anything like a discussion

347
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:47,519
so if you have like any awesome ideas
step forward

348
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:52,209
meg no yes

349
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:26,670
yeah definitely more there's there's a
whole different things to different

350
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:32,780
ideologies here that I basically
actively blocking and storing an attack

351
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,390
from happening whenever you have
knowledge of it to the other side of the

352
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,069
coin is that we just want to let it
happen and be mindful of it and be aware

353
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:47,380
because this way we can just happened
but I mean if if an attacker realizes

354
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,960
that you've seen called them they're
just going to try harder so maybe if we

355
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,400
let them know we're seeing goal tonight
get us so yeah this is blowing and

356
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,990
fucking will just keep monitoring

357
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:14,850
that's something I really think about
more but yes yes it does

358
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:27,170
couple months I think in August 2015 it
started but it actually does trigger ace

359
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:32,820
fam like an anti spam thing if you
search I think twice within three

360
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:48,330
seconds so unfortunately there is no API
yeah I hope there's one thing you can do

361
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,440
anything you can search and here I know
like some of mine

362
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,330
informations in here in like it's crazy
to this passwords and I still use sadly

363
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:02,279
a survey uses the word of action have to
go in and change which is really like

364
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,090
you can do wildcard searches but it
limits its 200 results which kinda sucks

365
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,030
but still give you a better idea into IP
address e-mail name first name phone

366
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,900
number really cool tool

367
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:19,160
imported the linkedin.com actually
received a legal matter of busing from

368
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:28,720
LinkedIn about this new league would
ever like a cease and desist where the

369
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,350
first thing they said was you know it's
illegal in the state of California we're

370
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:39,690
not even in the us- we don't have things
and then they went on like something

371
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:46,460
like eleven more paragraphs like
refuting it just like no actually just a

372
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:57,080
really long know they also offer coming
down to me that's

373
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,160
y'all make this conference really so
that's the reason Rob over here puts it

374
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:10,310
on the stove bells because of you also
thank you very much and if you'll see

375
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,380
Eric and always the other tall guy with
a red shirt on can you tell him happy

376
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,550
birthday it's his birthday
