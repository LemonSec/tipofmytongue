1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:27,220
alright good afternoon everyone so for
those of you who don't think so

2
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,890
requisite number of certifications and
agrees I've been doing that sperm good

3
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,750
number years at this point eighteen
years into this lovely I T stuff

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,119
so at present I work at Ennis I'm also
part of Maryland defense force per unit

5
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,229
so do some fun things

6
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,790
principally I'm doing risk assessments
and securing our athletes from outside

7
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:03,200
so I'm part of the defense side of
things I thought line with never hackers

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,910
and I'm allocated space some of our
lovely hacker organizations back in the

9
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:16,870
Dec metro region and just this past
weekend I became an Iron Man 2 so yeah

10
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:25,940
we have some crazy people in the
industry if you follow any of my Twitter

11
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,870
feed you'll see it's it's a lot of names
just like what's coming out so people

12
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:38,950
can't so this is the best we talking
about attacking mindset for defenders

13
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,769
how many of you are on the defense side
of things instead of like penetration

14
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:52,400
testing ok let's get and how many are
more on the attacker penetration testing

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,620
everyone else is somewhere between
that's a good mix I can work with this

16
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:09,340
one of the things we tend to see is that
you know we don't really have an

17
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,380
attacker mind set on the defense side of
things you know we we tend to just be

18
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,810
left article go through

19
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,810
here's our compliance has our checklist
template thing then we're good to go

20
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:33,959
there's not a lot of thinking evil so
people you know where little abnormal on

21
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,510
the defense side yeah you know this so

22
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:47,780
with that in mind talk a little bit
about Reggie me losing my lovely purple

23
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,640
teaming and what exactly it we're
looking at in terms of our wrists are

24
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,238
threats and what we can do you know why

25
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:12,280
serious business I'm sure you don't have
to explain to anyone here just what

26
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,250
exactly information security is but i
just give a presentation to a bunch of

27
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:27,910
DevOps so how do you know I included the
whole process of we're here to help you

28
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:35,400
help yourself has it really is a team
effort and without the bad guys that

29
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,849
security is often thought of that way
where their vilified as hackers where

30
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,320
they were

31
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,440
defenders or attackers Thank You media
for changing that wording on us

32
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,560
previously it was just thinking outside
the box which is what we really need

33
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,740
more of we have enough box check us out
there

34
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,659
and if you say this word you know what
to do

35
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:12,150
information security is where it really
is but if you have to explain it to

36
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:30,530
someone they will understand this could
play if not security and if you actually

37
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:39,289
look at the ref for 453 actually
includes in there that complaint visit

38
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,420
security the purpose of complaint is to
keep us on a common thread moving

39
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,120
forward so that our systems have a
commonality for security that we can

40
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:59,150
trust one another because at the basis
of this it's all about the trust and now

41
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,750
we've had these breaches they've been
PCI compliance that has not helped them

42
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,780
because compliance is just the beginning

43
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,369
everyone does compliance wrong it's not
a checkbox to be marked off and forgot

44
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,840
about it the starting point that we can
build from this is another one of our

45
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,599
issues being defenders cuz we get fast
with implementing all this compliance

46
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,190
docs PCI I so you name it

47
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,360
there's companies that need to have all
of it and management doesn't necessarily

48
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,430
understand that we can layer this so
that we're working everything they look

49
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,680
at each individual thing as its own silo
so we end up reading implementing the

50
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,220
same things and just reinventing the
wheel when there's no point to it we can

51
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,920
leverage it and we can do inherited
controls and start doing cross

52
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,330
referencing

53
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,878
we just need to work on educating
everybody in the entire process to be

54
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:16,960
more security mindful it's an uphill
battle it doesn't get easier and I

55
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,539
assume everyone knows the FBI cyber no
one likes it

56
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:44,039
that's true so along with us we have
people that fall under the compliance

57
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,039
officers this is part of my day today

58
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:56,270
risk assessment reports are lovely Nexus
output and other output from school you

59
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,900
know you have to be constantly
identifying what the issues on your

60
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,419
network what's false positives you know
what's really out there but things

61
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:10,870
change people don't do their patches if
you look at one of the recent Verizon

62
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:19,919
DVRs they have stuff from 1999 that they
were vulnerable 'tis out there that have

63
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,859
been exploited so you have stuff that's
out there but who knows when it was

64
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,070
updated and people to start talking
about us or they've gotten busy because

65
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,919
our sysadmin have a lot of work to do
you know they're not necessarily

66
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,689
security minded and that's not really
part of their duties per se their duty

67
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:52,839
is to maintain systems and ensure its
function money but we still need to

68
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,769
integrate into all these fields thinking
more like the devious attacker hey I

69
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:06,620
didn't do my patch cycle this month so
where's my weakness now there's

70
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,440
something new every month but it's not
really the hottest new zero day that's

71
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,029
going to end up getting you compromise
and it's going to be your catches a

72
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:30,920
couple of years ago right I told you
this would be entertaining with that I

73
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,319
think a little more interesting because
hey what are we all here to do

74
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:46,490
hack the planet everyone wants to be an
attacker right so what does that usually

75
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:54,390
tend to mean for us for us this is
generally penetration but not everyone

76
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,569
needs from the defenders point of you
wind up getting a lot of

77
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:08,160
adversarial relationships going whether
its internal team or it's an external

78
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,189
team you're fighting them because
they're grading you and this is the

79
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,970
perception we're being graded on how we
have secured our system immediately we

80
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:26,420
don't like you so clearly we need to
work on changing that perspective part

81
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,490
of the purple team approach is working
with everybody's so that we're not being

82
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,470
adversaries were you think this is a
learning opportunity for making it full

83
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:43,170
cycle you know to turn into a more
holistic approach everybody to do their

84
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:49,599
job and be awesome at it without
thinking that he didn't apply patch of

85
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
last month that's just not going to work

86
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:03,750
give-and-take guess we can always learn
something from both sides of it i mean i

87
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:13,390
attackers are necessarily doing but they
can't attackers famous things to it just

88
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:26,130
tap the hardest part is starting to
think like the attacker so my career I

89
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,140
started out doing Unix Linux system
administration before I moved on into

90
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:40,920
security while I had some of these think
evil processes going yes I know shocking

91
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,979
right but it wasn't fully there now
someone starts talking about hey I want

92
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,030
to implement this project can we use

93
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:59,089
puppet or darker and now my immediate
responses ok well how is that talking

94
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,420
two things you know where is their
communication where there is a trust

95
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,880
level and how can I exploit that

96
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,930
because what we're doing is we're
splitting trust where they were

97
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,890
exploiting people are exploiting
software there is a trust layer there

98
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:21,840
and that's what we're seeking to exploit
without trust and make a little harder

99
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:36,690
but sometimes when you trust and I think
compliance isn't security and it isn't

100
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:43,630
but it gives us a baseline for where we
can start building that trust level if

101
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,510
you've certified a system according to a
certain level whether it's low moderate

102
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,330
or high I know the baseline of what
security you have actually implemented

103
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:59,260
on that system from there you know I can
filter trust layer between your system

104
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:08,120
and one of mine of equal or lesser value
as an attacker I can also leverage that

105
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:16,250
in order to see well with the process
the way it is okay you've implemented no

106
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:22,270
PCI or or next moderate well you
probably didn't go along and do these

107
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,290
things so there might be something I can
watch it very easily and it's all about

108
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:33,530
thinking what hasn't been done we're
always looking for this little loopholes

109
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:40,490
are so much fun sex toy and the best
thing is the people

110
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:49,529
his people are always going to be our
weakest link there's just no way that

111
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:54,699
we're ever going to have a secure system
and this is why security is so important

112
00:13:54,699 --> 00:14:00,560
because technology has taken over lives
right now we live and die by smartphones

113
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:10,369
we're connected 2417 electronic leash
and so much of her life is out there and

114
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:18,089
we have the CTF going on where you can
do a little digging on people who would

115
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,630
you could find out their social media
about him

116
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:26,660
have you ever had a friend that does
this kind of open source intelligence go

117
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,810
through until you shocking facts about
yourself or what they can find now you

118
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,420
know something like your address if you
own a house that's that's not really

119
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,579
shocking public record but when you
start thinking about other things what

120
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:48,630
conferences have you checked into on
Foursquare Twitter Facebook yeah when we

121
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:55,230
left at the doctor when did your doctor
all this builds more things that

122
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:02,269
attackers can see as far as finding
points of weakness to identify and start

123
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,480
building that trust level with you and
we can exploit this

124
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:13,130
as defenders we don't always think about
this with think we need to lock down our

125
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,740
systems we need to hide everything but
we're not thinking what exactly is that

126
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:29,600
they're looking for us to be a little
hard but you know sometimes it's just

127
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:38,720
really a share a whole lot some people
share everything and it's up to everyone

128
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,870
to decide how much you really want out
there just know it . put you out there

129
00:15:44,870 --> 00:16:10,980
every week I really want to clear it did
you know there are some highlights in

130
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:19,870
regard to security process security
processes that sometimes it's just too

131
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:31,470
easy to get to things because people
circumvent the rules I mean they're

132
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,580
helpful they're paying but this is what
we have policies this is why we have

133
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:43,930
procedures why we have complained if
it's done right it should you know make

134
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:55,459
certain things might happen is really
easy stuff to do it's fun because people

135
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,680
don't follow the rules

136
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:14,730
any kind of scary at times the stuff
early isn't over data that out there

137
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:23,530
it's reachable so when we gonna do now
we need to start working together it's

138
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:30,670
actually more blue team in some places
actually most places and my experience

139
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,870
they don't have internal ready then I'll
have internal penetration testing

140
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:43,419
generally it defaults down to
vulnerability assessment which that can

141
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,910
be enough for some organizations but it
really depends on what your assets and

142
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,170
your dinner valued at so at least on a
yearly basis you should have a more

143
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,900
in-depth audit where they are doing a
little bit more in terms of testing both

144
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:18,620
your personnel and systems or because as
much as some people would like to think

145
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,110
that simply running necessarily want
this going to secure their systems

146
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:31,230
there's a lot more out there that we
need to test and keep tabs on and

147
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:38,500
actually keeping tabs on and having
those metrics for what have we done you

148
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,020
know how much you know what are our
attack vectors how many attackers have

149
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,660
we had and have been successful

150
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,340
well

151
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,320
if you can even tell and that's always
the hard part is not everything is set

152
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:00,760
up to where you can tell whether you
necessarily an intrusion we'd seen is

153
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,039
where it's been over a year

154
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,500
p.m. comes to mind when they were in
there for over a year before it was

155
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:15,190
found out and these are the things that
we need more in-depth testing that's

156
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,970
also why you want to have a good
relationship between red teaming and

157
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,490
blue teaming and when you're having that
in-depth testing done you can get these

158
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:41,059
things fixed cuz otherwise everybody
just gonna be unhappy I'm sure what are

159
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:47,570
our primary target and that's a pretty
much everything out there can be client

160
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:55,740
list it can be government secret there's
something of value to everybody and it's

161
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,010
not necessarily what you think may be of
value to you know your competitors that

162
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,169
really like your client Lewis and what
you're what you're paying to your

163
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,740
suppliers

164
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:14,559
that's going to give them an advantage
when they go negotiation so there's a

165
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:22,549
lot more things that we have to think of
in terms of where bilities live and how

166
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:30,340
many people being technical would you
assume that analyst is a priority

167
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:39,250
a lot of times it just falls down to
this is the you know this is our

168
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,350
intellectual property

169
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,580
this is the important stuff this is what
we're building our walls and other

170
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,220
things that end up being administrative
tend to fall by the wayside

171
00:20:50,110 --> 00:21:04,549
so and evaluation in terms of the data
itself so that appropriate defense

172
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:15,379
mechanism can be in place everywhere
where it probably wasn't our fault but

173
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:26,360
are usually protecting the stuff of
course realizing what your threat is

174
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:33,330
actually coming from a lot of places
like to go overboard but the reality is

175
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,689
not everybody is the target of
cyberterrorism it's the hot sexy thing

176
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:47,179
that's out there but most of your that's
going to be people that are poking

177
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:51,830
around or your direct competition these
are the people that really want your

178
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:58,220
data and I share the government then
everybody is against you anyway so yeah

179
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:10,640
throw it all out there there's just no
winning hard

180
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:21,990
part of that is because of our old
method everything still works to back in

181
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,510
the day

182
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:31,860
think Cold War espionage and old-school
super old school things to work our

183
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:41,530
people are the weakest link and this is
our best way of getting in this includes

184
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:49,980
everything as far as we have our own
vulnerabilities and as far as going up

185
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,400
and making friends with a low level
employee because maybe they don't have

186
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,180
direct access to what you're interested
in that they have access to the network

187
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:07,450
if you can get on it and you can
leapfrog and it's fun from there and

188
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:14,000
recovered open source intelligence but
there's a lot of their you confine

189
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,720
besides just people you know if you look
at a government or if he's sometimes you

190
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:26,560
can actually get really good idea of
what their networks break down to so

191
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,320
there's a lot of data that's put out
there it's just part of their usual

192
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,409
business process but it can be
manipulated in ways that your business

193
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,220
personal may not consider this it's not
a weak point it's just business

194
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,850
you know we need a quote for fifty
Windows systems running this type of

195
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:57,480
server hardware and software but now I
have an idea of the footprint of your

196
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,060
network without doing anything besides
seeing what you guys put out for an RFP

197
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:10,090
so now I can limit what I have to do in
terms of attacking and I can start

198
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,840
specifically doing that for that OS
version for that software version that

199
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,699
you're standing up and then I just have
to find a weak spot where

200
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:30,110
someone hasn't changed the default
passwords updated and if anything it

201
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:41,039
should but it's easy so I can we do
obviously I mean information security

202
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:49,870
cover the broad very very broad gamut
but implementing more testing of the

203
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:59,149
appropriate level now we can't just rely
on vulnerabilities are scanners to be

204
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:02,459
catching all of our problems there's
more to it than that we have more

205
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,980
weaknesses and we need to start
leveraging our professionals that we

206
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:14,580
have to come in and do those tasks and
find those weak spots so that we can fix

207
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,770
them are real attackers come in

208
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:25,139
obviously physical and personal security
is always an issue

209
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,750
people are the weakest link and this is
something that everyone just gets here

210
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,799
because didn't you

211
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:43,210
annual training it really isn't enough
because we all know we just SAT there

212
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,399
and we click into work through with it
because it was the same slide show last

213
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:55,158
year at that is this year with that we
need to do more interactive training so

214
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,740
they started thinking oh you know what
maybe I shouldn't click on this link you

215
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,409
know maybe this African Prince doesn't
really want to send me a few billion

216
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:09,690
dollars these things to work their tried
and true and they still work

217
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,140
casino but security it's hard

218
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:33,360
attacking is easy but security I got
memes fifties obviously we're all pretty

219
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,159
well certified individuals and there is
a difference between a Certification

220
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:47,740
Certification glut and knowledgeable
testing however it does give us a

221
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:58,540
baseline because they've got turned on
something so what does but additional

222
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,760
training at a professional level
certifications can help IT

223
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,180
certifications or not the end all be all
actual hands-on working knowledge is way

224
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:18,050
more valuable than having certifications
much more valuable remember trust but

225
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:23,280
verify you are the weakest link so
confirmed before you start sending

226
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,800
information to people should be simple
but

227
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:43,139
there's a lot of hackers out there how
to use it so you know remember your

228
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,570
friendly when you got problems we might
be able to help you or we can at least

229
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:53,309
refer you to someone who they know what
they're doing and they can take care of

230
00:27:53,309 --> 00:28:45,070
it and for me it really comes down to
you know security is still Kostner so a

231
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,620
lot of its getting buy-in and having the
right people in the management level

232
00:28:49,620 --> 00:29:01,250
along with that though you get a lot of
pushback in some places let's say dear

233
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,760
do the great place to not get pushed
back because there's directives so you

234
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,800
tell them they have to do something that
will fabulous to work with civilian side

235
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,889
you get a lot more pushback well why do
I need to do this I don't have the

236
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,070
funding

237
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:21,879
and you know you just want to show us
weaknesses getting them to start

238
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,250
thinking about it kind of just showing
I'm walking through the process

239
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,440
especially if they've they don't know
security setting and going even

240
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,710
something as simple as going through an
audit whether I think these are things

241
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:41,790
I'm checking against and it's not a
reflection on you with its not met this

242
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:48,310
is your opportunity to get more funding
then they start thinking oh I can get

243
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:55,330
the toys I want so I just need to make a
use case and that will actually help

244
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:02,629
start that thinking process of what else
could be attacked I need to upgrade so

245
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,590
it it does help plenty of incentive
everywhere and just getting it in terms

246
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,530
of where people don't feel like you're
attacking them and being at fault for

247
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:18,790
something that a lot of times it's
almost they've completely missed five

248
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,850
years of patch scheduling you know
sometimes I simplyjust hardware and

249
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:30,800
software issues that it wasn't
implemented correctly so that's that's

250
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,010
been my biggest thing actually in terms
of having access to start buying their

251
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,010
own their own ways of presenting symptom
management

252
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:14,879
I finish at 11:26 p.m. I started at 7
a.m. I finished what's happening right

253
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:25,540
now clear ok yes according two days
seasons whatever I feel like today it's

254
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:38,030
clear it's huge that will throw that out
there
