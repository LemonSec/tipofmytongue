1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,439
hello and welcome to

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,759
the cloud native security day courtesy

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,279
of sig security

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
we shall be playing a capture the flag

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,639
game today and this

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,679
is how you participate

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,440
first of all we will run through a

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
precap but at the end of the day we will

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,640
have a companion

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,439
recap to go through the scenarios and

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,400
understand

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,720
during a rye retrospective exactly what

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,000
happened

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
but first of all we are going to wet

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,439
your appetites for some

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,800
parental honking peace indeed

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,239
was never an option for a naughty goose

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
today's goal is to learn in a happy and

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,480
joyous environment

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
we're grateful to have the absolute

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,879
pleasure of helping people on their

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,000
security journey

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
and containery hackery we've built this

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,920
in collaboration

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
with sig security and we have a learning

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,680
outcome in mind

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
for every scenario throughout the day we

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,160
are using the same platform

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,480
as last time so those of you with prior

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,199
experience

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,000
will know how to enter the game for

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,040
everybody else

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
we have a companion website slack

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,080
channel

35
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,400
and plenty of volunteers to aid you on

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
your way

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
we also have a newly minted twitch

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
channel this year

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
with a roster of pre-eminent kubernetes

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
security personalities

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,080
to give you a red or blue team

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
perspective on the scenarios as we

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,960
navigate

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,680
the turbulent waters of kubernetes and

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,479
cloud native

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,040
security so what can you expect

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
to delve deeper into the dark and

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,119
mysterious world

49
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,759
of kubernetes your adversary has

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
exploited a supply chain

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
and you start your journey deep inside a

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
kubernetes system

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
looking to hunt and collect the flags

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,479
they dropped

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,720
and hopefully learn something along the

56
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
way

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
no waterway is safe and you can play six

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,079
increasingly beguiling and demanding

59
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
scenarios to bushwhack your way through

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,880
the dense

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
jungle of cloud native security

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
everybody is of course welcome

63
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,318
from beginner to hardened veteran as we

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,199
venture out

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
amongst the low hanging fruits of

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,400
insecure configuration

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,360
and scale the lofty peaks of full

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
cluster compromise

69
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
so yes you should find these a little

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,120
bit tricky

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
and increasingly difficult but you can

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,840
and please do

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
ask for help at any time at the point of

74
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,239
today is to learn and not to compete

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,599
of course you're welcome to compete

76
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,599
against friends family

77
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,040
and colleagues now these clusters aren't

78
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
going to stand up themselves

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,360
so we have a team of task masters

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,879
managing the infrastructure

81
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
and on hand to provide help on slack

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
there are six scenarios to advance

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
through throughout the day

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
and the instructions are all in the

85
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
companion website

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,800
so let's see louis guide us through a

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,680
first time

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
user's experience

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,599
thank you for that introduction andy and

90
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,720
what a great day

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,239
it is going to be to break out of some

92
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
containers i am indeed lewis the head of

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
training at control plane

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
and what i'm going to do now is i'm

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,680
going to give you a demo of one of the

96
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
scenarios that we did last year for the

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
ctf

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
to get started you're going to need to

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,800
contact the taskmaster via dm

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
on the cncf slack channel

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
you'll be able to find us taskmaster

102
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,440
probably posting gifs throughout the day

103
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,599
now once you've contacted the taskmaster

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,799
they're going to go and they're going to

105
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
get a cluster from cubesim

106
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
now these clusters have been

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
misconfigured on purpose

108
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
the taskmaster then needs to send you

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
credentials the safest way

110
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,080
they know how over slack

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
incidentally don't worry because we've

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
got an intern ready to take the fall

113
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
if anything should happen

114
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,400
so once we received our file we want to

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
check that we've got it downloaded and

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
we see we have a tar file here

117
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,239
so we need to get the contents out so

118
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,959
tar xf

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,439
and then with these files i'm able to

120
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,080
run an ssh command

121
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
and accepting the fingerprint i'm now

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,320
inside a container that was a little bit

123
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
quick

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
if you're not used to doing things like

125
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,959
this then have a look at the website

126
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
we'll have videos specific to operating

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,759
systems

128
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,360
and equally if you're still struggling

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,040
just reach out to the task master

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
we're there to help now i can see that

131
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
i'm in someone else's

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
shell well someone else's container who

133
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
knows where we are

134
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,199
but let's get started now i'm going to

135
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,680
go through the quick happy route

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
i'm going to start by looking at what we

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
have mounted within our

138
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
container and i can see here that there

139
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
is something interesting called the dev

140
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
xvda1 what does that not mean i still

141
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,600
don't know

142
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
um i'd recommend having a look on a

143
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,639
search engine

144
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
just find out that's what's encouraged

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,919
today

146
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,440
so we're going to mount this so we're

147
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
going to mount dev xvd a1

148
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,560
onto our mount directory now let's have

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
a look in here

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,759
now i wasn't expecting to see something

151
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,199
like this this looks like the root file

152
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,360
system

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
of another machine so i might have just

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
broken out of a container onto the host

155
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
machine running for container that we're

156
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
on

157
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,919
yeah now having a look through here i

158
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,759
can see some interesting folders

159
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
um but the one that really sticks out to

160
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
me is the node secrets

161
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
so let's just have a look in there so

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
check them out no secrets

163
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
and let's just cut out

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
there we go we've captured the flag i

165
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,479
would copy this flag and i'll send it

166
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,080
across for taskmaster

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,560
who will probably send even more gifs to

168
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
congratulate breaking out the container

169
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
and completing the scenario we've got

170
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,360
six scenarios

171
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
all different uh difficulty levels um

172
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
