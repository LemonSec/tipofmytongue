1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,520
and i'm going to jump right into it

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,720
because this is a lightning talk and

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,400
it's going to go by fast

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,520
today i'm going to talk to you a little

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,600
bit about why if you're doing devops

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,000
right

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
you should be solving for security and

8
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,599
that's where of course

9
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,599
a lot of these cloud native security

10
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,280
concepts and technologies

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,039
come into play in terms of being able to

12
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,960
deliver those outcomes

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,199
now we can't have a talk about devops

14
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
without defining devops

15
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
and we could spend all day or all year

16
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
on this because if you ask 10 people

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
what devops means you'll get

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
maybe 20 answers but if we take a look

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
at the wikipedia definition because no

20
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,200
one's allowed to argue with wikipedia

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,480
what you'll see is that there's an

22
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,559
emphasis on the practices yes there is a

23
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,280
tool chain

24
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,879
but it's really about the practices that

25
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,399
lead to this outcome

26
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,719
shorter shorten the development uh

27
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,239
systems development life cycle

28
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,399
and you get high quality software to

29
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,680
paraphrase

30
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
the goal of devops is shipping higher

31
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,800
quality code

32
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
faster and more frequently and of course

33
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
to production where it matters

34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,079
now why does this matter from a security

35
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,879
perspective

36
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,960
which is actually if you look at the

37
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,559
number of common vulnerabilities and

38
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,360
exposures

39
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,080
that are getting reported every week you

40
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,799
see that

41
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
over the last 10 or so years basically

42
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
since devops was born

43
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
there's been a 3 to 4x increase in how

44
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
many of these cves are getting reported

45
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,680
every week part of this is just we have

46
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,640
more software

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
we've been kind of in this you know

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
explosion and growth of the software

49
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,119
industry

50
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,600
taking over all kinds of industries or

51
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,280
as mark andreessen said

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,600
software is taking over the world um

53
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,119
software's eating the world that was his

54
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,000
quote from about

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,680
10 years ago and what we can see is that

56
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,079
that

57
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,280
brings along with it a lot of

58
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,119
vulnerabilities more code means more

59
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,200
vulnerabilities and how do we manage all

60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
of it

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,479
now if you kind of deal with that sort

62
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,000
of at the end of your software

63
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
development life cycle

64
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,720
uh you get this kind of kind of crazy

65
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
effect where

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
you're just getting hammered with the

67
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
amount of code that needs to be scanned

68
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
and remediated

69
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,719
and it feels a little bit like the scene

70
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
out of i love lucy when they're in the

71
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,040
chocolate factory

72
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,280
and they can't keep up so the conclusion

73
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
that we have here

74
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
is that we need some amount of

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
automation it's essential when you

76
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,640
factor in

77
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
just the growth in the number of cves

78
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,160
out there the growth in the amount of

79
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,200
code that's trying to get

80
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
out into production and then you take

81
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
into effect things like containers

82
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
as sort of uh one of the staples of

83
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,040
devops tool chains

84
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,760
and how they're very ephemeral so

85
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,480
instead of

86
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
patching and hardening a vm that we're

87
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,160
going to keep in production for a long

88
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,640
time

89
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
we want to throw it away and rebuild it

90
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
again so we're going to need a lot of

91
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
automation to deal with that

92
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
now there's kind of looking at this is

93
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,959
we can't just automate at the end we

94
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,080
need to sort of

95
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
cause security to happen in more places

96
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,400
some people talk about this as shifting

97
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,879
left

98
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,959
or expanding left and there's a couple

99
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,080
things to consider here

100
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,160
one is just on the design side and how

101
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
do you educate more developers to

102
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
be mindful about security practices but

103
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,760
there's also thinking about

104
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
how do we automate in security points of

105
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,200
control

106
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
along the entire development and

107
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,239
deployment life cycle

108
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,440
and that's really where you start to

109
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,280
kind of get into some of these

110
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,000
uh cloud native security technologies

111
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
where you can think about

112
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,239
hey how do i get code from development

113
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,159
into the into the hands of customers and

114
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,440
in front of users

115
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,200
and what are my points of control in

116
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
that life cycle knowing that we're going

117
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
to go around it again and again and

118
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
again

119
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
now even the best laid plans if you

120
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,519
develop a system to do this if it's

121
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,280
painful to use

122
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
developers are going to go around it and

123
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
take the gumdrop path

124
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,080
um and that's not because they're bad

125
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
people but it's because they're just

126
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
trying to get their job done

127
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
now this was actually a really great

128
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,000
insight that was shared

129
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in the state of devops report from last

130
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
year which is really about you have to

131
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,159
make these platforms a compelling option

132
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
and this becomes really important when

133
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
you've designed these platforms to help

134
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,319
solve

135
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,840
all these critical security needs

136
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
whether it's scanning or points of

137
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
remediation and control

138
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
you you spend all this effort to do that

139
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,000
but then you don't want developers to go

140
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
around it so you have to have them in

141
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
mind as the customer

142
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
so how do you make it a developer

143
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,200
friendly thing so this is kind of the

144
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,799
the formula to think about the the

145
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,640
mathematical proof if you will

146
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
that gets you to when you think about

147
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,720
the outcomes you're trying to achieve

148
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,279
the challenges that security brings in

149
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,478
as well as things like

150
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,560
the ephemeral nature of containers and

151
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,519
behaviors

152
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,759
that developers exhibit you really need

153
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
to automate this whole

154
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
platform and life cycle in a developer

155
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,919
friendly way and you probably need to be

156
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,600
thinking about that on a constant basis

157
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,759
with a team that's really thinking about

158
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
a developer friendly platform so

159
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
at the end of the day if you're doing

160
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,560
devops right and you're doing it on an

161
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
ongoing basis then you've solved for

162
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
these security challenges

163
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
now if this was interesting to you i

164
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
have a 43 minute version of this talk

165
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,759
that you can find

166
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,600
you can google it's pronounced devops

167
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
the sec is silent

168
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
because this bright talk url is probably

169
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,880
going to be impossible to memorize

170
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
so with that i want to say thank you and
