1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,399
okay hey everybody hope you're all

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,360
enjoying

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
cloud native security day so far my name

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,919
is john kinsella i'm a chief architect

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,960
at acurix gonna talk about a project

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,480
i've been working on for a while

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,880
um this is a more of a proposal in a

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,079
talk form

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,080
bound around security nutrition labels

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,279
for cloud native

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,920
projects open source projects in general

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
so the idea here this originally came to

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,439
me

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,160
probably close to a year ago from an

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,359
academic paper

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,760
that was talking about nutrition labels

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
for privacy

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,840
i think we covered this at some point

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
application security weekly room co-host

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,879
i can't find a link to it so

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,840
unfortunately i don't have it in the

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,879
notes

23
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,000
everything else i'm talking about is

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
referenced in we've got a page at the

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,120
back of the slide deck here which talk

26
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,640
which has all those links

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
but um so that's where this came from

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
uh and let's sort of dive in and talk

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,199
through so the point of this really is

30
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:53,680
is

31
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
i want to start a conversation here this

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
is being recorded a month before you

33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,800
guys see this so i'm still working on

34
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,280
this

35
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
i'm hoping to have a proposal into six

36
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,920
security

37
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,119
uh stuff you're gonna be seeing here is

38
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,960
on a github account so i'll probably be

39
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
pasting this in

40
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,360
um either while you guys are watching

41
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,439
this or during the q a at the end

42
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,560
um and and enjoying and

43
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
i'm i'll probably say many times but i'm

44
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,240
looking for feedback so

45
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,759
give us what you got so the

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
food and drug administration fda in the

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,799
united states

48
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,040
they consider this thing which i suspect

49
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
all of us have seen

50
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
uh the nutrition facts label to be one

51
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,159
of the

52
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,240
uh most widely known graphics in the

53
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
world

54
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,799
uh you know we see it we sort of know

55
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,000
what's on there it's getting better

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,439
over time i'll talk a little bit about

57
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,520
the history but the idea is how do i

58
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,240
bring something like this

59
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
to security um and really in a

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
uh you know it's obviously not going to

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
be mandated by law so how do we do this

62
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,159
in a

63
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
uh a friendly way that allows people to

64
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
to have a sense of

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
what they're consuming and that that's

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
the core what's going on here

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,960
so the nutrition laws first came around

68
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,439
uh early 1900s i want to say in 1907

69
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,000
when fda

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,878
was formed again in the us this has now

71
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,840
grown you know there's

72
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
these type of rules are our labels are

73
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
all around the world in one form with

74
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,840
another

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
uh but really what's interesting is

76
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
their their uh creation came from

77
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
packaged goods packaged foods and

78
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,720
what happened is as people started

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,480
vendors started selling packaged goods

80
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
in in that manner you know there's

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,959
always going to be looking for someone

82
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,200
to make a few more cents

83
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,480
so start trying to figure out how do we

84
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,920
make that package either a little bit

85
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,200
smaller but look like it has the same

86
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,480
amount of stuff in it or maybe it's

87
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,680
cheaper ingredient

88
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
or maybe use more dangerous and great

89
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
ingredients so these are the type of

90
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,080
things people were doing

91
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
and you know people probably started

92
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
dying

93
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
or they weren't getting their money's

94
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
worth and the government said that ain't

95
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,280
that cool

96
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
so um a lot of started getting created

97
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,560
and

98
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,080
i don't know maybe there was some sort

99
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
of tom fuller in another company was

100
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,319
saying hey

101
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
let's let's get the other guy so let's

102
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,959
get some laws i'm not sure the exact

103
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,239
creation but

104
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,599
i spent about a day digging into this

105
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,280
stuff and fox pulling down into it

106
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,560
and it's let's keep going um in the 70s

107
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,159
uh the first versions of the nutrition

108
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,840
labels were actually mandated

109
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
uh from a point of view of if you were

110
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,879
making health claims on the package

111
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,239
so when these are mandated around the

112
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
world it varies but you know

113
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
in the us's once you started saying hey

114
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
this makes your son

115
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,640
healthier or stronger or taller that's

116
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
the type of thing which people start

117
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,680
regulating

118
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
if you mention something like baby food

119
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,440
or what's in your baby food that's when

120
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,959
people get really nervous the mother's

121
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,239
out there probably listening to school

122
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,280
already sort of

123
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,879
that you know don't don't mess with my

124
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,200
little one and then since then every

125
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
decade or so

126
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
we've had some amount of tuning and

127
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,799
tweaking going on is this type of

128
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
document

129
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,439
uh and that's usually based off science

130
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:53,920
uh

131
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,239
you know as either our scientific

132
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,360
understanding of what we're consuming

133
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
gets better

134
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
or as the bad guys use science to figure

135
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,480
out a cheap way of getting something

136
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,799
extra goods

137
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
here we are so this is now going on over

138
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
to the digital side right

139
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,280
we've all heard about what apple's up to

140
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
i believe google's doing some of this

141
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,159
stuff as well

142
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,238
this is the a privacy label for

143
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,490
google photos

144
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,600
[Music]

145
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
doing a lot of linking but you know this

146
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,199
is just being shown sort of that we went

147
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,479
from

148
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
food labels to digital labels from

149
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,919
privacy point of view so let's think

150
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,120
about what can we do with this for

151
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,160
security

152
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,919
um and obviously again you know we don't

153
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,080
have the

154
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
chokehold of a government we don't have

155
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,360
the chokehold of apple's

156
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
app store but what can we do in a way

157
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,800
which still allows our users to

158
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
have a little more trust in us

159
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
so from my own personal point of view i

160
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
thought about this from two aspects

161
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
uh one of those is when i'm first

162
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,320
looking at a project

163
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
what does it do right is is this if i

164
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,199
install this is it going to be taking

165
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
over my cluster or is it going to be

166
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
formatting my disk

167
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,199
or is it uploading data or

168
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
just generally what what's this thing

169
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,160
doing that i just downloaded i can't

170
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,919
code review everything

171
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,520
um if it's a big famous project that has

172
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,199
you know ten thousand stars on github

173
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,360
okay we've got a little more trust in it

174
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
um

175
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
probably as i think about that i'm

176
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,919
aiming at this more towards the sandbox

177
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,560
and the

178
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,639
um the middle step whose name i'm

179
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
forgetting uh in the the cncf process

180
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
those are the guys who

181
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,800
we're trying to figure out how do we get

182
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
them help so their project get more

183
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,720
adapt

184
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
adoption and then the second aspect is

185
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,600
installation help

186
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
this is a big one to me probably not so

187
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
much

188
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
um with an off-the-shelf thing you just

189
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
download and run like a brew install but

190
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
something that's a little more complex

191
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,880
like

192
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
i'm not going to name names but you

193
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
download the thing you compile it you

194
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
install it and then the configuration

195
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
starts and you

196
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
do one configuration you need to do

197
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,440
another configuration then you need to

198
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,720
create usernames you need to create

199
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
roles and the next it's at some point in

200
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
there you're so far in that you don't

201
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,039
want to back up and give up because

202
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,039
you've already committed this time to it

203
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
but you're like i wish i knew this

204
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,400
beginning before i got started i would

205
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,759
have gone and just bought something

206
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,080
right

207
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
so that's that's really what i'm looking

208
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,360
for here is

209
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,199
how can we help provide transparency in

210
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,440
these type of things

211
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,319
this is really not about uh you know the

212
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:20,800
whole

213
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
red green blue security bad don't use

214
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,960
type thing right

215
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,479
this is more uh advisory uh

216
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,400
not looking to admonish right we're open

217
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
source we're not trying to

218
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
spank people we're trying to get people

219
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
to do the right thing uh to increase

220
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
trust uh and i think what's an

221
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
interesting side effect of something

222
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
like this this is sort of a little bit

223
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
like a self-assessment

224
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
um and depending on where it goes this

225
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,479
might get linked into the

226
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,840
self-assessments i can see that as a

227
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
possibility

228
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,800
but i think as a application developer

229
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
or as a project

230
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
is realizing hey maybe i want to put a

231
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
security label or a badge on my

232
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
applic on my project on github

233
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,080
as they start going through and looking

234
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,599
at all those tick boxes that they could

235
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,280
be able to do or the ammo will show in a

236
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
few minutes

237
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
that might make them realize oh hey i

238
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
could do this really quickly and become

239
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,599
that little bit better on my badge

240
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,720
maybe they knew about it they just

241
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,840
hadn't got to it yet or maybe they

242
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,880
hadn't even thought about it

243
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
so i think from either aspect i think

244
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,479
there's some benefits there

245
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
to people doing that

246
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
and as fun as that is to talk about

247
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
those labels um

248
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
let's be honest here right if most of us

249
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
walk into a store in the morning

250
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
say it's lunchtime and we're hungry

251
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,479
we're not going to be like this lady

252
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
here just going down the aisle picking

253
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
up every box and looking and reading

254
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
what's on the back of it

255
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,639
it's a lot more uh at least for me over

256
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
you know beside the last year covid

257
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,599
it's lunch time i go into store i grab

258
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,800
something i give somebody money and i

259
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
want to shove it in my face and go right

260
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
i'm not looking at detail

261
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
we will in some cases if we have a

262
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,720
dietary need

263
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
or we're buying something for a loved

264
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,759
one we're really careful about what

265
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,199
they're consuming

266
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,400
are some use cases like that but

267
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,919
what i'm trying to say is is you know

268
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,039
we're looking at the front of these

269
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
packages on the shelves

270
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
and that's where industry came up with

271
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,199
the system of

272
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
what they call a front of package label

273
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,319
and

274
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
you know let's let's get my ugly mug out

275
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,319
of the way here um

276
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
depending on the country or you know

277
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,840
obviously we have different languages on

278
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
here um

279
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
there's different ways different

280
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
organizations have gone about doing this

281
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,039
sometimes it's for

282
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,200
adult health sometimes it's for weight

283
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,440
watching sometimes it's you know

284
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,039
let's i think it's brazil that's

285
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,760
actually doing some of this for

286
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,279
trying to minimize obesity in the

287
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,679
country

288
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,519
but one way or another we want to put a

289
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
simpler label on the front

290
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,720
that isn't this is 39 of your

291
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
recommended daily allowance it's like

292
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,560
hey

293
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,399
from a quick glance should i be eating

294
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,560
this should i be eating a lot of this

295
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
uh it's not this is poison don't touch

296
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800
it it's more around

297
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,480
hey maybe you don't need five krispy

298
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
kremes right

299
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,839
so it's a little more guidance and this

300
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,440
is sort of

301
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
when you think about it this is a lot

302
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
like our badges we have on modern day

303
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,279
projects

304
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,200
on on on github right

305
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,279
so i don't have i haven't boiled down

306
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,640
what i'm looking at when i'm researching

307
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,399
into something quite this

308
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
beautifully simple that's what i'd love

309
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
to get to uh

310
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,600
you know most of those badges are pretty

311
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,040
small i'm not sure how much information

312
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,320
i could fit into them maybe it'll just

313
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
be a link out to somewhere else but

314
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
that'd be a nice goal to get to i think

315
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
for this um so

316
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
the graphic designers audience uh i'll

317
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,839
show my skills a little bit but i'm

318
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
still looking for help on that

319
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
uh so brainstorming what this actually

320
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,920
looks like or what we could put into

321
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,839
this

322
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,360
uh contents of label so in you know

323
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
the top few are pretty understandable uh

324
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,279
network connectivity

325
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,640
is this thing opening up a listener on

326
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
the network uh and you know actually

327
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,839
when you think about it

328
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,640
another use for a nutrition label like

329
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,279
this

330
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
it if someone's claiming that they're

331
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,800
not doing that and then suddenly an

332
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,440
application

333
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
is doing that

334
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
i don't want to say that's a sign of

335
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
tampering but that would sort of give

336
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,959
you

337
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,160
an extra an extra bit of information

338
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,800
during a

339
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
investigation so i think there's some

340
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
value there for that as i as we go

341
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
through this

342
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,800
um root privileges are they needed uh

343
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
you know do i need to run this is with a

344
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
um cluster admin role binding

345
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,079
the credential aspect is pretty

346
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,440
interesting we're seeing more and more

347
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
applications now that

348
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,560
uh they want an api key to go and

349
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
connect to github

350
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,920
atlantis comes to mind i've been working

351
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
on that recently or

352
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,839
um you know maybe it needs like

353
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,959
terraform once your

354
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,040
your credentials be able to go and spin

355
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
up uh

356
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
um vms on azure

357
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
or you know there's all sorts of

358
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,880
different use cases there around that

359
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,760
but that's something that

360
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,800
especially in enterprise world when

361
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,839
someone says oh i need i think for azure

362
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,600
in particular you can't just use a

363
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,320
read-only

364
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,360
account to look at your co your aks

365
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
clusters you need to have admin rights

366
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,240
to get the keys to get into them

367
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,360
a self-respecting uh enterprise with a

368
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
modern security policy isn't just going

369
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
to do that automatically so if they knew

370
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
something about that up front

371
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,839
as one example that that that's

372
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,360
something they want to understand what

373
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,880
they're getting into

374
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
uh we're all thinking about software

375
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
supply chain

376
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
so i threw a few points in around that

377
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
here uh and i think that's again you

378
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,480
know

379
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,839
transparency if we can help these people

380
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,600
do this or understand this

381
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
in that sort of you know checkbox type

382
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,640
format i think this will be handy um

383
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
and then the next group are a little

384
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
more advanced a little more mature

385
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,360
so i've we've got three examples here

386
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,240
coming up

387
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
one's a sandbox one's one of my own

388
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
applications or accuracy's applications

389
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
and then ones um a very mature

390
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
application so we'll see the difference

391
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,519
between those three how they show off in

392
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,560
something like this

393
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
do you have an architectural diagram

394
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
how about a threat model so these would

395
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,639
be more like just hate drafts right

396
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,240
if you've done a self-assessment

397
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
questionnaire if you are um working on

398
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,839
graduating from cncf

399
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,240
from the sandbox let's link out to that

400
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
so people can sort of see it very

401
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
quickly without a lot of this also is a

402
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
lot of this information is available

403
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,360
already

404
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
but how can we make this um sort of one

405
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
stop shop to get as much this type of

406
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
data so people can actually

407
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
you know i know if i go to the nutrition

408
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,680
label i can find

409
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
if they have a threat model i can find

410
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,800
it there and just go and review it and

411
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,399
keep going or i can look at their

412
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,160
self-assessment questionnaire from that

413
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
nice easy place

414
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
we're seeing more of the um the mature

415
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
projects starting to do third party

416
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,920
reviews

417
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
kubernetes has been doing it for a while

418
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
linker d we've got in here they've been

419
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,720
doing it

420
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
security contacts again you know this is

421
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
something that's fairly basic but

422
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,519
i'll point it myself not all projects

423
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,680
have it uh and then a security page do

424
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,959
you have sort of a single place where

425
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,639
people can go and find out more detail

426
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,200
about

427
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
the stuff we're talking about um i'll

428
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
try to not bob my head around i know

429
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,959
this camera's trying to follow me so i

430
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,720
hope that's not dragging people nuts

431
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,399
but keep going um

432
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
so three examples uh yaml

433
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,079
you know i figured we're always doing

434
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,680
the ammo already for most of stuff we're

435
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,480
doing around here

436
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
let's put this into a yama format as

437
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,160
well uh

438
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,639
and to sort of grab a pointer and go

439
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,279
through here

440
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
starts off fairly basic so this is for a

441
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,880
cncf

442
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,760
sandbox sandbox project called

443
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,120
telepresence some of you may have heard

444
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,839
of it

445
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,000
long story short it allows sets up a

446
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
proxy between your desktop and a

447
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,959
kubernetes cluster so you can do remote

448
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,240
development you know so

449
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
application name source code url so

450
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,360
people can go and find that if they're

451
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
not there already

452
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
uh is it sending on the network is it

453
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
receiving on the network is it starting

454
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,240
a listener as i mentioned before

455
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,440
what port so this is where i'd love to

456
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,160
put as much as

457
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,199
i can into a a defined language but i

458
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,560
think for something like this there's

459
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,839
got to be a lot of just strings

460
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,720
right so a proxy is going to be

461
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,079
listening on whatever report that

462
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,040
somebody

463
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,120
needs it on another example down here

464
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
under privileges

465
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,440
what type of credentials are required in

466
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
a kubernetes cluster

467
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,600
this thing needs if this thing consumes

468
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,079
the the privileges of the person running

469
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,760
that application from their desktop

470
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,360
there's a minimum set of requirements

471
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,639
but that's what they're consuming

472
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,000
what the application's consuming doesn't

473
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
need roots doesn't need privileges so

474
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
you know looking pretty good here so far

475
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
um some of their commits are signed not

476
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
quite all of them

477
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,760
and then same with builds so i think

478
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
andy builds nowadays that goes on to

479
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,920
homebrew has to be signed

480
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
and we're seeing more and more of that

481
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,839
type of thing

482
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
excuse me the interesting one here on

483
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
the git commits and i'm not sure i

484
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,519
haven't been watching what the the

485
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
um software supply chain guys have been

486
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
doing in detail but

487
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,040
from a point of view of very few

488
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
projects have been signing their commit

489
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
since day one

490
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,279
so do we say hey the last three releases

491
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,959
have had their all their commits signed

492
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,519
maybe

493
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,880
all their commits in the last six months

494
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,959
have been signed is it the last hundred

495
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,079
commits have been signed

496
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,320
what type of verbiage could pui put in

497
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,760
their language could we put in there

498
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
that that makes that

499
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,360
meaningful but not a very black and

500
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,399
white yes no that

501
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,079
most companies or most projects couldn't

502
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,480
actually respond to

503
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
let's move forward to example number two

504
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
this is for terascan this is an acure x

505
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
application open source

506
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,440
uh and really it's an isc application

507
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,279
that can scan kubernetes and

508
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,360
customize and helm and um terraform

509
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,759
uh but again so sort of going through

510
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,279
here

511
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,199
he's able to you know get the url for

512
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,199
source um he's

513
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,720
listens he excuse me he sends on the

514
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,560
network by default he down you know he

515
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,800
sends out a request to get to a github's

516
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
dual poll

517
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
uh for his rules uh listening is

518
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,040
optional so it can run as a server

519
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,120
or by the time this is published as an

520
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
admission controller

521
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
but by default it doesn't so listing

522
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,079
that's optional i think that's

523
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,560
okay to do listens on a particular

524
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,759
report

525
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,279
unless that's overridden most arrests is

526
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,000
pretty clean

527
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
again recent git commits have been

528
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,279
signed i've been pushing for that

529
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,279
uh our builds are signed and we actually

530
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,560
have an architecture diagram so we're

531
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,079
able to get you know one point there on

532
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:28,720
the

533
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
advanced things i don't have a contact

534
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,000
for security it's something we need to

535
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,680
do and

536
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
hopefully by the time this is published

537
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
um

538
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,240
so moving towards something a little

539
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
more advanced still advanced

540
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
still here so this is linker d graduated

541
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,320
project

542
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,519
um and again it starts off sort of the

543
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,279
same you know send and receive and these

544
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,160
type of things

545
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
he's doing tls by default uh they're

546
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,920
they're really trying to do security but

547
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,440
secure by default so they're

548
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,120
um they're able to check boxes like this

549
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
a lot easier so that's going to look

550
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,440
better in a diagram right in a

551
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,920
nutrition label again it's a proxy type

552
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
application so the ports listing on it

553
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,400
varies

554
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,119
uh it does need cluster rules uh you

555
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,599
know you

556
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,359
i think you can run linker d and maybe

557
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
just a single

558
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,400
um name space i think so you

559
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,599
might not have to have a complete

560
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,359
cluster role binding but really if you

561
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,319
want to do anything useful with it i

562
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,959
think that's the way you're going to go

563
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,079
again sign git commits assigned to

564
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,559
builds

565
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,599
and then as we come down into the

566
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,039
maturity stuff you're seeing more stuff

567
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,679
down here so

568
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
they've got a security page they've got

569
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
their third-party audit they've got

570
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
their architecture diagram they've got

571
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
their security contact

572
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,600
so you know we're filling up more on my

573
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
screen here uh there's more stuff that

574
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
we could put into these

575
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,039
uh slides so that i haven't dreamed up

576
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,240
yet some of them i'm trying to

577
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,200
keep you know this readable so bear with

578
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
me

579
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,080
but that's sort of an example of looking

580
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,280
at three different three different

581
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
applications how would they

582
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
how would they be um how do you

583
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
communicate

584
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,720
in a a yaml form what their

585
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
security facts their nutrition facts are

586
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,080
so that's sort of

587
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
thoughts on that so then you know let's

588
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
go from this into a graphic format what

589
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
would that look like

590
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,440
if we came back to our initial slide so

591
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,799
this is something i mocked up from

592
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,480
linker d um you know it's

593
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,559
it's easy it's simple it's not too much

594
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,840
for me to talk to here right

595
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,080
it's when you take that and sort of

596
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
break it down into a

597
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,679
consumable visually consumable format

598
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,039
it's it's

599
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,200
um i sort of like this i have to say so

600
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
uh a few check boxes that they're doing

601
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,799
industry standards

602
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,080
maybe not everything i'm not sure if i'd

603
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
call variable ports industry standard so

604
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,039
i left that off

605
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,160
same for the cluster role binding

606
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,679
but a brief description what they're

607
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,200
talking about name their project and

608
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,160
then you know

609
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,039
the all-important who do we contact if

610
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,200
there's a problem

611
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
and maybe there's a few more things i

612
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
should put in here i'm not sure about

613
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
putting in links for the security pages

614
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
i guess it could be or maybe just a link

615
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
rendering html so

616
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,720
um we'll see what we do around that so

617
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,200
um

618
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
this is what i've been working with this

619
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
is the idea i've been playing with i'm

620
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,679
looking for any feedback anybody want to

621
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,000
work

622
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,919
work with me on this as i mentioned i'm

623
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,840
hoping to have this in as a

624
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,480
proposal into six security um and we'll

625
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,679
see where it goes from there

626
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,760
uh but i appreciate your time i think

627
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,039
we've got about 10 minutes left for

628
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,919
questions

629
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,559
