1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,760
hi folks and welcome to computing

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,359
confidentially in the clouds

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
a lightning talk introducing the topic

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,040
of confidential computing

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,880
my name is ava black and i'm an open

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,240
source program manager

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,920
at azure in the confidential compute

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,640
team

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,240
now today i'll be speaking more about a

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
broad shift in technology

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
rather than any specific company or

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,359
product or open source project

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,279
uh there are some places you can find me

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,560
on the internet like

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,599
the consortium or the cncf i'm also

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,040
pretty active in kubernetes in the code

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,960
of conduct committee

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,480
and you can follow me on twitter

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,280
so you might have heard the joke uh that

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,800
uh the cloud is just someone else's

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
computer but this is really

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
it's a misnomer it belies the complexity

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,640
and the scale

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
of operating a cloud and it hides all of

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
the work underneath those layers

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
which must not be forgotten if you were

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
well working in security

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
now if you're not cloud provider then

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,320
your operating environment

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
uh is fundamentally different today than

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,560
it was before you were consuming a cloud

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
or you're using a cloud uh whether it

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
was a decade ago or more

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,040
but contractually speaking the business

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,840
arrangements

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,119
or agreements around responsibilities

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,119
requirements to protect data are not all

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:21,840
that different

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080
today than in the days of dedicated

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
hosting when everyone got their own bare

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,759
metal server

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,720
and over time we have added a lot of

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
additional security protections

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
to encrypt data at rest encrypt data in

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
transit

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
we've even added specialized hardware

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
devices

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,479
particularly to cloud computing

49
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,119
environments like hsn's and tpms to try

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,880
and bring some of the security

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
promises back to these environments

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
there are we can talk about three

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,399
different isolation

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,079
models guest guest guest host and host

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,200
guest traditional hypervisors only

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,880
support two of these right they protect

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
the host

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
against potentially malicious guests

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,600
because if

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
a guest could compromise the host it

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,199
could then get at other guests

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,640
and we don't want that now confidential

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
computing

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,319
tries to invert this tries to protect

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,959
the guest

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,680
against a potentially compromised or

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,640
malicious

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,959
host environment whether that compromise

69
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,840
might be

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
a fault in the kernel or an unpatched

71
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,440
device firmware or whatever it might be

72
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
some layer below the guest

73
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,280
if the compromise with a threat comes

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
from there today there is really not

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
much protection in the guest environment

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,840
and so this movement by the industry is

77
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,480
trying to

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
trying to solve that uh particular

79
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,760
problem or that that threat vector

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,319
now no security solution is perfect and

81
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,599
so this should be seen as

82
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,640
entirely additive to any existing

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,160
security measures you might have in

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,879
place

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,519
it's also still very early days and so

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,720
things are changing pretty rapidly

87
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,159
now the confidential computing

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,920
consortium itself is another linux

89
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
foundation project

90
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920
like the cncf backed by some of the same

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,800
companies

92
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
a lot of the large hardware and cloud

93
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,159
providers

94
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,800
and it has as a group we've defined

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
confidential computing as the protection

96
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,239
of data in use

97
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,959
by performing computation in a trusted

98
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,159
execution environment

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
and all these companies since the

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,159
founding about a year and a half ago

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,920
a lot of companies have come together to

102
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
really rally behind this cause and try

103
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,360
and bring this

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,560
vision to reality

105
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,760
along the way we've identified three key

106
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,799
properties

107
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,480
and make a given environment

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
confidential

109
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
as well as some additional properties

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,799
that might be present but are not

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,879
necessary strictly speaking to protect

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,679
data in use

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
we've also identified two different

114
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
modes

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
if you will for that protection based on

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,239
hardware one is process based

117
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,640
and one is vm based or application based

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
and so the in the process isolation

119
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,760
scenario

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,480
a particular trusted environment is set

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
up where a process is run

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,200
uh it's launched within a untrusted

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,920
guests

124
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,880
next to other untrusted processes and

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,759
this

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
works through uh the cpu itself

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
in this case sgx but that's not the only

128
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
way arm trust zone

129
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,360
has a pretty similar model to this and

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
it's just less prevalent in cloud so i

131
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
didn't really include it in the slide

132
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
the alternate model the vm based model

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
actually relies on the hypervisor to

134
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,040
launch

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
a trusted guest operating system but

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,639
it's the cpu

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,960
that is ultimately isolating that

138
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
environment that memory region

139
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,680
those memory pages from other guests

140
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
from the hypervisor

141
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,400
and from other hardware devices

142
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,680
now i should mention tpms and hsns

143
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
these tools have been around for a while

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
and people often ask how are they

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,000
different

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,039
than tees a tpm

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,000
lets a verifying process verify the

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
integrity of other components of the

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,160
platform

150
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,280
like the hypervisor or the hardware

151
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,600
but it doesn't isolate memory it doesn't

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
protect against

153
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,479
a changed

154
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
different access pattern but it might

155
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
let you detect a

156
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,039
faulty system or an unpatched system

157
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,080
something like that

158
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,039
and an hsm lets you protect the

159
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,039
confidentiality of some small amount of

160
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,759
data like

161
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
a key but it doesn't guarantee the

162
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,280
integrity of the application

163
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
processing that data

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
now today available for cloud native use

165
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
intel has released the sgx device

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
drivers for kubernetes

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
which is pretty awesome and azure has

168
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,600
also been working on some similar things

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
and we have in production uh kubernetes

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
clusters with sgx devices enabled in

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:58,319
them

172
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
i know a couple other cloud providers

173
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
like ibm also have

174
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,199
sgx available to their clouds uh and

175
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,680
this is

176
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
you know useful for launching or

177
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
orchestrating

178
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
with kubernetes a process designed to

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,520
use an sgx device

180
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,440
i did mention at the beginning of this

181
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,039
talk the notion of trust and maybe

182
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,479
inverting trust so i want to talk

183
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
more about that and i need to introduce

184
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,000
two

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,120
legal terms now the exact definition of

186
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
these terms varies depending on what

187
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,639
regulation you're looking at

188
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,960
what region you're in um and so the gdpr

189
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
here in europe for example or if you're

190
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,199
in california the ccpa

191
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,600
other states like washington uh have

192
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
other laws that are being drafted right

193
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,039
now i know india is looking at similar

194
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,919
laws

195
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,479
um this talk is not legal advice i'm not

196
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,599
a lawyer

197
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,000
so whatever region you're practicing in

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,960
or

199
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,440
operating in uh if these laws apply of

200
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
course consult your own attorneys

201
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
for advice but i want to add the gist

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
here

203
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
whenever a person's data is handled by a

204
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,560
company

205
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,919
with whom they have established a

206
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,680
relationship like say for me

207
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
my email provider that company is the

208
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,960
data

209
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,199
controller they are controlling the data

210
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,280
on my behalf and according to our

211
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
agreement whatever i checked and signed

212
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,400
when i signed up for that email

213
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
uh provider now that data controller

214
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,199
might set up agreements with other

215
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,960
businesses to process data on their

216
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,520
behalf

217
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,080
maintain backups or off-site data

218
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,120
recovery

219
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
or index the data or provide some other

220
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
services for me

221
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,599
those data processors operate on the

222
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,840
data on behalf of or under the guidance

223
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
of the data controller

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
and so there are obligations as far as

225
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
protecting my data

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,879
on both of those entities and and those

227
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,919
might differ between

228
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,280
different laws again so i'm not going to

229
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,360
give advice here but just broach the

230
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,039
topic we all need to begin

231
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,400
considering these implications

232
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,639
one thing is important to think about

233
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,879
that none of those obligations today are

234
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,879
contractually enforced between the data

235
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
processor data controller

236
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
it's a business agreement there's no

237
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,280
enforcement at a hardware or a crypto

238
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
level

239
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,400
so that's today what if

240
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
what if we could enforce policy

241
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,599
cryptographically you know notary is

242
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,199
working on enforcing it

243
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,160
uh and adding that capability for these

244
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
checksums

245
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,000
for what images are run and signed where

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
and by whom and that's fantastic

247
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,000
what if the actual launch control could

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,519
not just be through the orchestration

249
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
system but verified in the hardware

250
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,559
does that help i think it might this

251
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,000
also sounds kind of like blockchain

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
but maybe without the massive power

253
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,040
consumption so that's cool

254
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,720
what if as a tenant i could lock down my

255
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
environment i could prevent

256
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
the cloud hosting company or their

257
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,000
agents or

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
anyone else using the environment from

259
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
accessing

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
my data or my customers data and what if

261
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,000
i could verify that

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
through a trusted third party even if my

263
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,839
data controller

264
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,680
chose through business agreements to

265
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,519
have someone else process the data on my

266
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,240
behalf

267
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
what if i could still maintain that

268
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,279
enforcement through hardware

269
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,519
and so really what if we what if we

270
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,320
invert

271
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,160
the trust relationship inherent in

272
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,640
outsourced computing i think the

273
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,440
implications are pretty far-reaching now

274
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
a group at cambridge

275
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,399
i don't have the link handy but try and

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,120
get it and put it in chat

277
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,760
they recently published a position paper

278
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,399
that

279
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
proposes the implications this

280
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,000
technology could have

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
on the gdpr regulations and companies

282
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,600
underneath it

283
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
that it might strengthen the guarantees

284
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
that data controllers are able to make

285
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
and thus enable more companies to more

286
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,800
easily comply with the gdpr

287
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
i think that's pretty awesome there's a

288
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,080
lot of other implications i just don't

289
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
have time to go into here

290
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
but i would love to chat with you about

291
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
them and i'd love it if you're

292
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,399
interested

293
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,320
in collaborating on this you know come

294
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,399
work with the ccc or

295
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
look at some of the projects around

296
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,120
confidential computing and sgx or amd

297
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,680
sev

298
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,720
or arm trust zone and find ways to

299
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
surface up those capabilities into the

300
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
cloud native landscape

301
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,120
and the ccc is actually planning to host

302
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
a dev summit pretty soon stay tuned for

303
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,079
details

304
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,920
um we're really you know we'd love the

305
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
collaboration between

306
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,880
cloud native and confidential computing

307
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
so if you like this talk you know find

308
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,959
me online follow me on twitter

309
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,760
you can find me on slack and send me any

310
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,720
questions you have

311
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,000
thanks so much
