1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,840
hello and welcome to the cloud native

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,040
security day actually

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,799
it's probably the last session so it's

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,400
about me to go

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
um my name is ariel shuper and i'm

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,840
trying to convince you about

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,239
kubernetes risk assessment and one the

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:16,960
reason

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
why there is a need to go one level

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,080
deeper

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
than what we have today or what is uh

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
commonly used today

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,599
so thank you for joining my session uh

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,679
who am i and why am i trying to convince

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,519
you to do that so my name is

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,640
ariel uh i'm a principal product manager

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,360
at cisco i joined cisco following the

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
acquisition of support shift

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
where i led the product uh the product

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,520
strategy the product design

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,559
uh in the product you know development

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,960
i was the product manager the vp product

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,000
management the

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,199
product manager uh in port shift uh

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
porsche was focusing on kubernetes

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,559
and easter security uh period to port

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
shifter was head of serverless security

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
at the aqua security

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,199
uh before that a checkpoint and

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,000
working in cloud security uh for many

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,799
years

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
uh open source contribution with qb

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,720
which is the open source tool we create

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,600
we

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,400
develop and maintain in port shift

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,200
focusing on

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,119
a unique way of scanning uh runtime

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,560
environments participate in istio

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,119
security working groups

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,600
and few others so

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
why do we need risk assessment what

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,960
worries us

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
and i think you know it's not secret

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
definitely not today that kubernetes

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,040
contain multiple elements a lot of

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,720
elements on the mastered a lot of

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,600
elements

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,840
on the worker know a lot of elements

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,119
around the container

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,840
and you know the pod themselves and each

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
one of those elements adds some security

52
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,960
complexity

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,680
more elements more more complexity more

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,560
items

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
to break now when we early days attacks

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
you know the first let the tesla famous

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
attack or the weight watchers or

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,119
around 2018 where the world was early in

59
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,720
the usage of kubernetes there was a lot

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,760
of a text which just

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400
stemmed from simple misconfiguration in

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
tesla or white torches no one thought

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,360
they need to configure

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
uh or at least to create some login or

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
credentials which required

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
authentication for people trying to

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,319
access the log

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
the dashboard because they thought

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
ubuntu's dashboard is inside the cluster

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
so what can what what what can happen

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
from that right and

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
a lot of those simple attacks came from

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,599
just you know simple misconfiguration

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
no one you know configure it properly uh

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
and for this purpose and i think you

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
know one of the main reasons

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
why uh we added it was to create some

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
risk assessment frameworks

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,080
something that allows you to address the

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
ecosystem to make sure you configure

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,599
everything correctly you did everything

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,560
properly

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
and you're not left exposed by yourself

84
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,840
now if you ask yourself what is like the

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,599
common one so the common

86
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
and probably the to standard today is

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
the cis benchmark

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,080
so the center of internet security

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
create benchmarks for a lot of

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
environments and kubernetes one of them

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
there's a comprehensive set of security

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
checks addressing

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
all the configuration of cortisol

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
elements there is a hundred and plus

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,000
last time i checked uh master node

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,440
security configuration

97
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
every component from the api server that

98
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,879
you need the controller manager the

99
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,760
scheduler

100
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
are looking into authentication

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,840
authorization put security profiles

102
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,360
network policies

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
everything which can govern and control

104
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
uh your kubernetes cluster and 30 plus

105
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,640
checks you know on the worker node

106
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,319
checking for different configuration

107
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,360
different you know security

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
configuration of the of the cubelet of

109
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,480
the

110
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
file system of the access to the host

111
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,560
etc etc

112
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
now all this is really great and i think

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,680
it's very

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
you know important part but one of the

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
challenges

116
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
that you know we see when we look at uh

117
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,599
how we secure kubernetes is there

118
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,360
it's true that misconfiguration are

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
fundamental risks in

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,640
kubernetes environment but

121
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
misconfigurations are not alone

122
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,358
there are more elements which can impact

123
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,040
you there are more attack vectors there

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,959
are more penetration options

125
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,639
if we analyze the recent attacks like

126
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,320
the one shown on my screen i know if you

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
have a chance to see it

128
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,880
things can happen even if you configure

129
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,600
your

130
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
you know cluster perfectly fine but

131
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,199
because you just

132
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,759
use the tool which is unsecure uh in the

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,600
example which is quoted by a nice

134
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
research from in teaser

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,680
it's about with scope it's because

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,320
someone

137
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,280
crafted like a vulnerable image and

138
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
planted or someone created like a

139
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
campaign or an attack or is really

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
targeting your environment

141
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
even if everything is really configured

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
properly even those ports which are

143
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
needed or those images which you use uh

144
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,560
can be uh and reason for that even if

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
the entire cluster

146
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
is configured uh properly so this leads

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,400
me to

148
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
at least trying to think that we need

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,240
something else

150
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,479
we need a framework that addresses the

151
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,800
entire spectrum of kubernetes first

152
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
not just based configuration we're the

153
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
framework that addresses

154
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
also the various stages of the cyber

155
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,880
attack

156
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,240
so meaning if misconfiguration or

157
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,280
security configuration are

158
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400
there in order to avoid someone from

159
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
entering the cluster we need also to

160
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,039
have tools that detect if

161
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,039
by chance or not by chance of farm other

162
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,960
reasons someone did manage to access so

163
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
we want to detect it

164
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
we want to stop it we want to minimize

165
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,360
and contain

166
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
this entrance so it's just just like the

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,880
misconfiguration we need to make sure

168
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,600
that

169
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,039
the entire uh life cycle of an attack

170
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,680
can be covered and i think what is

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,960
really important and might be missing

172
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,680
is when something is not configured

173
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,039
properly and i know that i need to

174
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,639
configure but maybe

175
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,160
i don't i can't maybe this is something

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,759
that i must change

177
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
or i cannot change i must leave it as is

178
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,759
what is the impact

179
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,520
what's okay so i have a challenge i have

180
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
a problem i need to

181
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,120
there is a problem but how do i fix it

182
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,400
maybe there's an alternative

183
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,319
so i mean this one will remain as this

184
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,000
but i can find an alternative

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,440
that can mitigate um this risk

186
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
so if i would try to create a

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
comprehensive tool

188
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
that would i would do um i didn't create

189
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,520
it

190
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
i found it and this is beautiful work uh

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,039
which was down by the mitral attack

192
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,720
uh and i'm proud to be a contributor for

193
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,120
that as well and in the mitral tech

194
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,000
what they did is they took the entire

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
attack kill chain or the entire life

196
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,919
cycle of an attack from the initial

197
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,800
access

198
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,440
to the exploitation execution to the

199
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
different stages whether it's creating

200
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,520
persistency or privileged escalation

201
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
and all the steps that attacker will do

202
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
in order uh

203
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,479
to get his hands on the data or in order

204
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,400
to abuse the resources on the cluster

205
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,360
whatever it doesn't matter

206
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,199
but we need to make sure that we don't

207
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,440
just you know stop at the gate we keep

208
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
following it and checking afterwards and

209
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,080
for each of it

210
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,120
they interpreted it they took like the

211
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
relevant things for containers so for

212
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,639
example

213
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,280
if we examine the privilege escalation

214
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,039
which is you know how you can escape to

215
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,759
the host

216
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
there are the techniques which attackers

217
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,199
were used

218
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,080
in order uh to gain access or in order

219
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,759
to break out from the container and if

220
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,800
you break out

221
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
how you can elevate your privileges and

222
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,919
reach the host

223
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,919
or take control of the system so

224
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
it is important those type of first

225
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,039
because not just

226
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,199
explaining what was done and how you can

227
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,960
do it but also to explain

228
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
or for you in order what you can do in

229
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
order to mitigate it so if i know that

230
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,400
there i'm exposed in this escalation i

231
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
would perhaps can address it by

232
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,919
placing using pod security profiles and

233
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,800
making sure that you cannot uh run as a

234
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
route or making sure that you cannot

235
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
read uh anything to the host file system

236
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,240
you can't use those network and there is

237
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,360
many other

238
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,319
capabilities which i can use if i want

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
uh to trade like error so the idea here

240
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,560
which i think makes the mitra attack

241
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
uh as a good candidate for risk

242
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,759
assessment in kubernetes

243
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,039
environment is the idea that we can look

244
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,879
at the entire spectrum

245
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,559
okay entire spectrum of potential

246
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
attacks so not just misconfiguration

247
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,000
but also any you know any option

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,200
uh to penetrate your cluster it also

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
doesn't stop okay it doesn't stop

250
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,680
on uh it doesn't stop on the items that

251
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
are just

252
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,880
you know just uh the entrance it goes

253
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,839
entire

254
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,000
uh life cycle of the attack every

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
different stage has its own

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,880
uh techniques and for every single you

257
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
know step there is something else that

258
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
you can do and there is a list of it so

259
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
for you as a user

260
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
there you get understanding of what's

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,880
the impact of this project and then you

262
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
can see if you have

263
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
an alternative plan you have like a

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,279
backup plan

265
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,600
and what i really find interesting about

266
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,880
it that it's based on

267
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
information collected you know from real

268
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
attacks incidents

269
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
not theoretical ones so this is just an

270
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,760
example

271
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
of why you know we need something which

272
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,160
is

273
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,880
slightly lever deeper and goes deeper

274
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,519
than

275
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,600
cs benchmark something that you know

276
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
give me tools

277
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
to allow me to mitigate and cover

278
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
uh the entire spectrum so everything is

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,000
available on the mitra attack

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,360
on the mitre org framework there is an

281
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
attack

282
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
metrics which will be published soon and

283
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
thank you very much for joining my

284
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,519
session

285
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,519
today
