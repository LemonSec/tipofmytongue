1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,000
hey everybody welcome to cloud native

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,679
security days presentation from

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,720
checkpoint my name is hill

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,279
solo from checkpoint security and what i

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,480
want to talk to you today about is what

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,240
we call cloud native devsecops which is

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,519
a long word which i'll try to explain in

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,160
a minute

9
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,599
uh but first a little background about

10
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
myself and about checkpoint uh my name

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,640
is hillel solo

12
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,160
as i said i'm the cloud innovation

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
architect at checkpoint c

14
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,680
cloud cto office uh i've been in

15
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,800
checkpoint for about a year and a half

16
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,920
and it came there by way of an

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,199
acquisition the checkpoint made up a

18
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:25,680
company

19
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,119
that i was one of the co-founders of

20
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,439
called protego and we were focused in

21
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,000
protego

22
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
on cloud workload security so we looked

23
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,120
at things like lambda functions and

24
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,000
azure functions

25
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
trying to understand how cloud native

26
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,760
security changed in the new serverless

27
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,399
world and the

28
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,879
the world of functions and cloud-native

29
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,000
containers and things like that

30
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
and so we were purchased by checkpoint a

31
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,520
year and a half ago

32
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,960
and since then we've been part of the

33
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,719
cloudguard organization at checkpoint

34
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
really trying to drive forward how

35
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,079
checkpoint helps customers

36
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
solve cloud security challenges and

37
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
cloudguard is a big suite of products

38
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,039
from checkpoint that deals with

39
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,000
everything from

40
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,800
uh cloud posture workload security uh

41
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,160
analyzing logs and

42
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,440
and looking for anomalies and so on and

43
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
so forth and our serverless piece is now

44
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,400
part of that

45
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
environment uh so i've been uh in

46
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,159
checkpoint for about 18 months i've

47
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,880
actually been

48
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
in this room for about 13 months so i'm

49
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
really appreciative of the opportunity

50
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
to find a reason to put a shirt on today

51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so thank you um and if there are any

52
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
questions afterwards if you're looking

53
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,439
for me i'm hcello at checkpoint.com feel

54
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
free to reach out

55
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,200
so what i want to cover today in a

56
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
really short time slot and so i

57
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
apologize for how quickly i'll speak

58
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
is first of all what what is devsecops

59
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
why devsecops why is it my problem as

60
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
developer and i'm really primarily

61
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
talking to you

62
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,079
developers out there and trying to

63
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,520
convince you that security is your

64
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,040
problem it's not someone else's problem

65
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,799
so why is devsecops a thing what do we

66
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
mean by that and then why do i claim the

67
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,320
cloud native devsecops is a different

68
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,439
thing or an

69
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,880
evolution of that thing uh what's

70
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,479
different about it and then finally try

71
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,280
to give you some

72
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,439
uh tools and tips and technologies to

73
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
how you can try to solve that problem

74
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
and own it

75
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
so focusing on what devsecops is to me

76
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,479
devsecops is

77
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,320
it's the philosophy that as a developer

78
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,399
i own security just like i own any other

79
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,079
feature of my product security is just

80
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,719
another

81
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,479
important product feature making sure

82
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
that my product works securely

83
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
it's just as important as making sure my

84
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,959
product works at scale or any of the

85
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,360
other

86
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
non-functional requirements we tend to

87
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,920
think of when we think of a product and

88
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
the idea that

89
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,200
till now security was something else

90
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,599
that was someone else's problem

91
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
is kind of a silly thought really it

92
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,480
doesn't really work all that well and

93
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
particularly as we move into more modern

94
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
applications

95
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
it's really challenging to stick with

96
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that paradigm so devsecops and really

97
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
i'd like to just call it devops to be

98
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,000
honest

99
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,319
is just saying security is yet another

100
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,040
part

101
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
of the functional and non-functional

102
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
requirements for our application that

103
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,599
means that we as developers

104
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,200
are responsible for deploying and

105
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,120
operating secure applications right once

106
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,959
once you own that once you say okay it's

107
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,239
me it's not somebody else's problem i'm

108
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,200
not helping them

109
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,959
it's my problem maybe they're helping me

110
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,239
well that changes a lot about what you

111
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,599
feel like you have to solve right

112
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,879
so security teams are still there

113
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,239
they're still there to help you they're

114
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,519
still there to provide

115
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
guidance and tools they're still to

116
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
there to look at the overall security

117
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,239
posture of the organization

118
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,519
they're going to worry about your

119
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,360
on-prem and cloud network security

120
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
postures and things like that but when

121
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
it comes to product and application

122
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
security

123
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,159
that's you that's part of your product

124
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,280
it's part of your application and you're

125
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
responsible for it and what that means

126
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
is things like making sure

127
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
that you do code scanning to look for

128
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
mistakes that your developers are making

129
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
and things like that and make sure make

130
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,760
sure your application is being deployed

131
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,720
securely

132
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,640
make sure you've got an operational

133
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,400
regime that gives you security

134
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,239
and protects you and so that that's

135
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
really devsecops is just saying

136
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
hey security is your problem mr

137
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,599
developer now let's see how you address

138
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,319
that

139
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,680
but i think that was last year's

140
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
revolution two years ago revolution

141
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,720
the thing i'm really trying to convince

142
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,239
you of today is that cloud native

143
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,280
devsecops

144
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
is equally your responsibility if not

145
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,159
more but also it's a slightly different

146
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:40,959
thing

147
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,720
and so why is it a different thing so

148
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
first of all when you move to cloud

149
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,360
native

150
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,159
you the developer you own controls for

151
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,760
security that you perhaps didn't own in

152
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,599
the past you are responsible for things

153
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,599
that make a huge impact on security that

154
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,040
were somebody else's problem several

155
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
years ago and are now your problem

156
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,680
things like network configuration vpcs i

157
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,280
am role configuration our back things

158
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,799
like that monitoring logging

159
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,159
all of those things are things that you

160
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,080
are operating and deploying

161
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
you're deciding on you're controlling

162
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,599
and they have a huge impact on security

163
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
and so it's really really crucial

164
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,319
that you're looking at that and saying

165
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,319
okay if i'm responsible for product

166
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,840
security if i'm responsible for making

167
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,238
sure

168
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,720
that my thing is going to work any hour

169
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,440
any scale

170
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
no matter what the attackers are doing

171
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,479
to it that means i'm responsible for

172
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,440
making sure that i am rules are

173
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,560
configured correctly that means i'm

174
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
responsible for making sure workloads

175
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,199
are in a vpc if they need to be

176
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,320
and that the security groups around

177
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
those things are correct that becomes my

178
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,360
responsibility so

179
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
part of it is is that you now own things

180
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,280
that you didn't own in the past

181
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,080
a big part of that is your

182
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
infrastructure is code revolution the

183
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
fact that all the infrastructure in the

184
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,600
cloud

185
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
can be managed as code and as part of

186
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
your code repository gives you

187
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
incredible velocity you love it

188
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
i know you i love it as a developer and

189
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,840
i'm sure you love it

190
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
yes it means you're responsible for more

191
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,240
things but it means you can change those

192
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,680
things as you need them to be

193
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
you don't have to call somebody and ask

194
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
them to provision a machine you just

195
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
provision a machine

196
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,840
you don't need to change around network

197
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
configuration you know what through

198
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,639
somebody else you could you can just go

199
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,919
do that in terraform script that's

200
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,720
really powerful

201
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
but it means that all of that

202
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
configuration is yours and i've seen

203
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,479
studies that claim

204
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
that up to 90 of cloud risk comes from

205
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
that misconfiguration

206
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,919
now that's really scary because it means

207
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,280
a mistake that you make can have a huge

208
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,639
impact but it also means you have

209
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,080
the opportunity to do it right so if you

210
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
plug those two things together it's my

211
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,320
responsibility

212
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
and i have the opportunity to do it

213
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
right well that really uh gives you a

214
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
path forward right

215
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
and the second thing is that there are

216
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
increasingly a large number of tools out

217
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,560
there

218
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
that can help you do that there are

219
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,440
tools to help you scan code their tools

220
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,000
to help you

221
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
scan infrastructure as code and

222
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,039
terraform scripts and confirmation

223
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,080
there are tools to help you scan

224
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,759
container images there are tools to help

225
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,080
you

226
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
with monitoring and logging etc and so

227
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
those things are at your disposal

228
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,199
to help you solve this problem but step

229
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,039
one again is identify that it is your

230
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,919
problem to solve

231
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,240
and that you're responsible to solve it

232
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
and so then what i want to finally uh

233
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,400
take

234
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,759
take to that is what are the pieces of

235
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,039
this that we need to do so the pieces

236
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:49,919
that you want to think of

237
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,120
first of all all the scanning things are

238
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
really important but now you need to

239
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,199
make sure

240
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
that i'm using tools to scan my

241
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,479
infrastructure and scan my code

242
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,400
for cloud problems so for example if i'm

243
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,240
scanning deployment scripts terraform

244
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
cloud formation those are cloud

245
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,440
constructs that i need to scan i need to

246
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,520
scan those things in the context of a

247
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
cloud environment how do i make sure

248
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
that my cloud formation template is

249
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
going to deploy something with the least

250
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,039
amount of risk how am i going to make

251
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,560
sure that my terraform plans

252
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
are all deploying things that minimize

253
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
my risk right so there are tools out

254
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,880
there to do that

255
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,759
and those are things you need to be

256
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,319
using the same is true for i am rules i

257
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,120
am role

258
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
least privilege is super important in

259
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,240
the cloud it's perhaps one of the most

260
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
important things you can achieve it

261
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,160
might

262
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,199
don't tell me don't tell anyone

263
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,720
checkpoint said this but it might be

264
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
more important than network security

265
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,919
getting i am roles properly configured

266
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,440
into cloud at least privilege

267
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
may make your risk diminish more quickly

268
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
than getting your network configuration

269
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,919
correct because

270
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,919
today increasingly we're talking about

271
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
sort of zero trust interactions between

272
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,319
resources

273
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,919
and workloads and things in the cloud

274
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
and the network is important but it's

275
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
not the most important thing

276
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
the cloud fabric is using things like

277
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
iam and rbac to ensure that

278
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
only the things that should communicate

279
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
do communicate in the way that they need

280
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
to and you doing that configuration

281
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,599
correctly

282
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,440
is going to make a huge impact on

283
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
security so getting those things right

284
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,919
are really important

285
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,280
and then of course making sure that all

286
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
of the operational parts of the

287
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
application are secure as well so making

288
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,120
sure your logging is

289
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,400
is connected to something that can

290
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
analyze it for anomalies and find

291
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,520
problems and you're looking at things in

292
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,199
runtime and not just relying on the fact

293
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,560
that you will i deployed it securely it

294
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
must be okay

295
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
it's not dev it's devops and make sure

296
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,639
that the operations piece of it

297
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
is really properly done for security as

298
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
well and then finally what i want to

299
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,720
leave you with

300
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,479
is a couple of things or a few more a

301
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,000
few things that checkpoint

302
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
provides today where we're starting to

303
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
really try to look at you the developer

304
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,680
as one of our customers and figure out

305
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,960
how we can help you

306
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
do your job better and again let's agree

307
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,639
three slides ago your job include

308
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
security now how do we help you do your

309
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,800
job better

310
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,639
traditionally things like cloudguard are

311
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
aimed at security people with their

312
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,319
dashboards and their integrations

313
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,759
and their jira notifications and their

314
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,599
slack and all that's great and you can

315
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,879
leverage some of that stuff

316
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,879
but you need to find tools that meet you

317
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,720
where you want to be so for example

318
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
checkpoint sourceguard product is a new

319
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
tool that helps you do source code

320
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,080
scanning in your repositories and

321
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
pipelines so that you can look for

322
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,000
things like

323
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
developer error you can look for

324
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
third-party components that provide risk

325
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
etc

326
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,919
the shift left component which is part

327
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,599
of the cloudguard suite allows you to do

328
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:05,919
that

329
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,440
through through the source card system

330
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,199
but also allows you to scan container

331
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,840
images

332
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
allows you to scan infrastructures code

333
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,199
templates scan your staging environments

334
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,319
if you have them to make sure

335
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,840
they're compliant before you deploy to

336
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,000
production allows you to do all sorts of

337
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
other useful things around security and

338
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
then the there's a serverless piece as

339
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
well within the cloud guard family

340
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,759
that allows you in ci cd again to

341
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,120
protect serverless functions and

342
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,479
workloads automatically

343
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,360
uh during uh deployment to uh aim for

344
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
lease privilege really

345
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
really tightly and automatically so that

346
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,839
as a developer i don't have to go try to

347
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,399
read through

348
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,279
you know hundreds of pages of

349
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,799
documentation to figure out what these

350
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
privileges but rather

351
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,159
i get to home in automatically on lease

352
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
privilege for my workloads

353
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
and then also what we call no code

354
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,640
runtime security so the ability to

355
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
deploy without having to modify code add

356
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,200
all sorts of

357
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
hooks inside my code deploy runtime

358
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
security in a way that is developer i

359
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
can understand and manage

360
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
but i can do it automatically in the

361
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
pipeline so that's again part of the

362
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,519
server's workload

363
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,519
capabilities of cloudguard so these

364
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
things and others from cloudguard and

365
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,480
again i know that i'm using

366
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,519
checkpoint as an example because that's

367
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,880
where i come from there are a ton of

368
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
things out there

369
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
there's open source and some other

370
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
products these things are all your

371
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,360
friends

372
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
and will help you drive to more secure

373
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,360
deployment in the cloud

374
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
something that is now your

375
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,959
responsibility so thank you very much

376
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,399
for the opportunity to present that

377
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
today hopefully i i got the message

378
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,600
through by saying enough times that

379
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,480
cloud security

380
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
and product security is your problem and

381
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,440
hopefully you see that there is a path

382
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,080
forward

383
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,279
to creating and deploying more secure

384
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,279
applications
