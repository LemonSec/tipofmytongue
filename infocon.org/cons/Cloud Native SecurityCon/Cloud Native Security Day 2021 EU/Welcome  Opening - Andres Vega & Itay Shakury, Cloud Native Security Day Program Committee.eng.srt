00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,920
hello and welcome to cloud native

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,000
security day europe 2021

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
i am andres vega one of the technical

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
leaders for the cncf

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
interest group for security and with me

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
hi everyone i'm itai shakuri i'm a

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,839
member in six security and also a cncf

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480
cloud native ambassador

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,199
we're gathered today with good reason

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
the cloud has changed i.t

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,199
and the way modern businesses are

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,240
conducted

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,119
it has enabled organizations across all

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,000
industries to

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
achieve velocity and innovate faster but

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,480
with moving faster

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,040
doing so securely and with less risk

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,600
remains a constant challenge

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
effective security is more than just

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,800
technology

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,600
it involves people process and

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,440
architecture

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,920
for that reason cloud native security

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
day is assembled as the premier

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,280
security day that brings together

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,960
project maintainers

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
experts and leading practitioners to

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,480
share their knowledge

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,159
and experience with you all

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,840
if this is your first cloud native

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
security day

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
this is a kubecon co-located event

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
happening twice a year around kubecon

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,960
and in addition to the already excellent

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,479
security content that you'll get

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,799
in kubecon which is perhaps geared

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,920
towards kubernetes

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
security in this event you'll give you a

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,840
broader more general view on the cloud

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,680
native security space

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
we will discuss trends tools

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
ideas and opinions from the cloud native

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,400
security

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
community so we really hope that this

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
event can complement your kubecon

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
experience as you can see from the

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,040
agenda

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
we have prepared great content and even

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,720
better lineup

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,280
of speakers you will be hearing about

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
the greatest and latest

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,680
on cloud native security there are a

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
number of breakthrough ideas in there

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,399
but there's also tons of great practical

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,439
advice

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
the topics range from supply chain

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,200
security subjects like

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
signing and verification software bill

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,960
of materials

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,000
supply chain logs moving

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
on to the noble use of kernel

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
technologies like ebpf

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
cutting edge technologies like web

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
assembly modules

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
advances to confidential computing as

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,599
well as

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
methods and approaches to policy

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,879
enforcement

69
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,280
workload identity and serverless

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
security

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
yeah there's certainly something for

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
everyone in today's agenda

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
even for those wanting to get their

74
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,560
hands on we have an exciting capture the

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
flag event

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,319
going out throughout the day and we

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
cannot introduce cloud native security

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,920
day without mentioning

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
seek security which is the group that

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
makes it happen

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,239
seek security is a group of individuals

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,080
collaborating under the cncf on a

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
regular basis around the same

84
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,959
topics that you'll hear about today so

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,319
if you find today's content

86
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
interesting you can get more of it all

87
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,159
throughout the year

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
by joining us in seek security and will

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
be very happy to have you

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,599
as a thai points out this event is

91
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
produced by the community

92
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
for the community we're here to share

93
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,519
and learn

94
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,080
we're gathered virtually but the

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,599
ultimate goal remains

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,159
as if we were in person network with

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,599
other attendees

98
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,560
participate and learn from others but

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
most importantly

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,840
have fun enjoy the event
