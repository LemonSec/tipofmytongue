1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,720
once upon a time not so long ago there

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
was a little code base

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
she was a happy little code base her

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
developers had written her with care her

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
dependencies were all up to date

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
all she wanted was to grow up to be a

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,680
real software artifact

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,600
all she had to do was travel through the

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
pipeline to the magical registry on the

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,359
other side

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,240
but here there'd be dragons grooves and

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
reveals and mirrors

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,480
and no one was quite sure how to safely

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,000
get past them all

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
she was stuck

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
no one would ever believe she was a real

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
software artifact with all these

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
monsters lurking in the mysterious

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
pipeline or stalking around the edge of

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
the registry

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,640
how could she ever accomplish her dream

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
then one day the lovely people from cncf

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
published some advice

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,280
a sort of survival guide

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
it said all kinds of things her

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,280
developers should sign their commits the

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,920
build pipeline should be reproducible

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
whatever that meant

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
she should carry with her in s-bomb

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
a few days later the most powerful man

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,920
in the land said some things

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
s-bombs for sure

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,080
and then the great big googles said she

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,410
should eat more salsa

35
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,880
[Music]

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
no that's not it there's something about

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,479
provenance and getting to level four in

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,759
the maze

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,360
and people kept talking about taking

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
along some guy named toto

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
he was supposed to keep her safe in the

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
pipeline or something and she should get

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,840
all her documents signed by a notary or

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
something like that

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,439
there was a lot of advice but it was

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,600
still confusing what she needed was a

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,479
map

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,280
and so she turned to the map makers

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,799
could they do it

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,650
only time will tell

51
00:01:43,650 --> 00:02:00,199

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,439
hi everyone my name is priya um i'm a

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,840
software engineer at google and uh

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,758
welcome to our talk on supply chain

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,640
security reference architecture and i am

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,319
alex i am a security engineer at raft

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,840
and it's really good to be with all of

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,959
you

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,520
awesome let's just jump right into it

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,040
so you might be wondering what the

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,280
reference architecture is so i think

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
alex is going to give us a quick

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,319
overview

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,200
yeah so as we alluded to in the video

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920
the the cncf published a document titled

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
software supply chain best practices

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,959
back in may and that included over 50

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,480
recommendations for how to protect your

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
software supply chain so the reference

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
architecture we're working on now is

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
meant to be a road map for implementing

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,319
at least part of that set of

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,879
recommendations it defines what the

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,120
components in a secure software supply

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,480
chain are it explains and illustrates

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
how those components interact with one

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
another and it maps those components to

78
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,959
some real world tools that you can use

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
today and we hope it's going to also

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
include some sample code and tutorials

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
that are going to help you get started

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,280
on implementing tools

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
um

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
supply chains have a lot of pieces to

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
them so in the next slide

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
we have this high level diagram we've

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,159
been using internally to guide our work

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,800
and it shows some of those pieces

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,319
and breaks them down basically into

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,680
three phases a pre-build phase

91
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,159
uh that is focused on the development

92
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,560
and handling of source code and the

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
identification and collection of

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
dependencies a build phase that's

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
basically a ci cd pipeline that results

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,519
in a final artifact and the post build

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,000
phase that's focused on the actual

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
delivery and deployment of those

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
artifacts

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,640
so uh priya of everything that's in this

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
diagram what is the reference

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
architecture going to actually cover so

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,799
the reference architecture is focused

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
primarily on the build pipeline phase

105
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
which is the middle section of the

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
diagram that alex was just going over

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,360
we're also going to provide some

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,519
guidance on best practices regarding

109
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
inputs and outputs of your secure

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,959
software factory

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,799
um and

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,720
right now we really are focusing on just

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,799
the bill pipeline itself but future work

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
is going to expand to cover additional

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,759
pieces of the supply chain

116
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
so

117
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,918
what are some of the specific things

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
that you can learn about in the paper so

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,240
the paper is pretty comprehensive but

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
we'll cover a variety of different

121
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
pieces that you might need to fully

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
secure your supply chain so this will be

123
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
things like integrating s-bombs or

124
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
out-of-stations into your pipeline so

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
you can verify where artifacts are

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
coming from things like managing signing

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,280
keys and public keys so that you can

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,199
make sure your keys are both secure but

129
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
also available to your users for

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
verification later down the road and

131
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
also generally the paper will cover all

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,240
of the recommended security practices

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
from the best practices white paper that

134
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,880
the cncf released a few months ago and

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
also how to actually apply those best

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
practices to your current supply chain

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,400
so we'll have some examples for how to

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,160
also secure your supply chain with

139
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
common tools that you might be using

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,240
in your supply chain already so things

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
like kubernetes

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
for orchestrating your pipelines tecton

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
in toto for generating provenance um and

144
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,240
spiffy for workload attestation

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
um so we'll i will be covering a lot of

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,880
other different tools and services in

147
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
the cncf and open source landscape as

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
well and kind of provide guidance on how

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
you can make each part of your supply

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
chain more secure so if you're wondering

151
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
if this is something that you can just

152
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
download and run it definitely is not

153
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
one of the things that we realize pretty

154
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
quickly is that there's a lot of

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
variables that are distinct from

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
environment to environment so your

157
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,639
company may be working with particular

158
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,720
languages and libraries and tools and

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
somebody else may have a totally

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
different stack that they're working on

161
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,240
and since our goal is not to build a

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
product

163
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
here um trying to account for all those

164
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
variables is just not practical so

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,039
instead what we're doing is giving a

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,400
theoretical description of the

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
components mapping those to some real

168
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
world tools that you can use and

169
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,919
including some alternatives if you don't

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
like our tools of choice

171
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
and then providing some inspiration for

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
how you can implement those tools

173
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
yourselves but you're going to have to

174
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,000
figure out how to fill in some of the

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
blanks for your particular environment

176
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,319
and its specific needs we do want to

177
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,000
emphasize that we're trying to ground

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
this in reality um and in how to do this

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
in the real world and i think that the

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
people who are working on this reference

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,560
architecture lend credibility to that so

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
um the project's being chaired by andres

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,039
vega from vmware tanzu and our chief

184
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,680
architect is michael lieberman from city

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,199
who has a lot of

186
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,880
real world practical experience doing

187
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
this with actual and fairly complex

188
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
supply chains

189
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
and then supporting them we have a lot

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
of people from all across the industry

191
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,240
including folks from ibm google box boat

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,280
raft systig nyu and a bunch of other

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
places so it's a wide spectrum of input

194
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
with people who are

195
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,360
actively working on secure software

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
supply chains in real life

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
actively contributing to the tools that

198
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
we're recommending or doing both of

199
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,520
those things

200
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
um so uh priya with all those great

201
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,360
minds at work when are we gonna expect

202
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,319
to see something okay great question so

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,199
hopefully the first draft of our

204
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,000
uh paper is out for the public to read

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
and to comment on and to provide

206
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,599
feedback on we're actually pre-recording

207
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,599
this talk about a month in advance of

208
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,160
kubecon itself and so though the paper

209
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
is not out right out right now we're

210
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
hoping that by the time this airs at

211
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,560
kubecon the draft will be available for

212
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
people to see so if it is hopefully it

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,919
is um please go ahead and read it please

214
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,919
feel free to share your feedback

215
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,960
it really is for you so any any feedback

216
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
would be greatly welcome and what else

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
can you look for from the stag so we

218
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,199
recently published a cloud native

219
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
security lexicon which is basically a

220
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
document describing different terms that

221
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
you might have heard when discussing

222
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
supply chain security and kind of what

223
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,360
they mean especially in the context of

224
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
the papers that we're writing

225
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
and there's also a cloud native security

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,039
map and landscape um to which we'll

227
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
cover uh different security tools and

228
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
services that you can use

229
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,280
um and we also just want to like clarify

230
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
that the reference architecture

231
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
as we're writing it we definitely see it

232
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,199
being a living document

233
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,720
right now we're definitely suggesting

234
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
certain tools that kind of fit into our

235
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,840
idea of a secure supply chain but we

236
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,159
fully expect that more tools will pop up

237
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
the supply supply chains will involve

238
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
based on what people need and require

239
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,320
from their builds and so we plan on

240
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
continuing to modify this document so

241
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,480
that it is as up-to-date as possible and

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,279
continues to reflect the needs of the

243
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
people who are actually building secure

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
supply chains uh so right now we have

245
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
kind of like left certain things out of

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,120
scope

247
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
but in future versions of the document

248
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
we definitely plan to integrate them so

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
things like hermetic builds and

250
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,720
reproducible builds are definitely on

251
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
the top of our mind and we hope to

252
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
discuss those in future versions of the

253
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,279
document if you're interested in getting

254
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,560
involved or taking part in this and

255
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
especially if you're interested in being

256
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
part of the community review of this

257
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
reference architecture

258
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
jump into the slack channel in the cncf

259
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
slack it's the tag security supply chain

260
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
working group channel um and then you

261
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
can also feel free to connect with

262
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
either of us we're both on the cncf

263
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
slack we're on github we're on twitter

264
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,640
so on and so forth um you can find us

265
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
out there on the web

266
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
once again i'm alex floyd marshall i'm a

267
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
security engineer at raft and i'm priya

268
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,720
i'm a software engineer at google uh

269
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
thank you so much for coming we hope to

270
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,560
hear from you
