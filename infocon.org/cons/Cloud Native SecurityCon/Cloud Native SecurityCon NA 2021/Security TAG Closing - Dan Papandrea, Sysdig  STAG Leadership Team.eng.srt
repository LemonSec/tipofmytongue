1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
artistly for the past six months to pull

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,359
this capture the flag and

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,160
uh talk track line up

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,440
as we had but besides of that there is a

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,440
bunch of things we do

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,679
let's say not as much as a community but

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,760
more as a society of

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,920
security conscious individuals

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,880
uh

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,960
brandon if if you share with the

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,240
audience what are some of the other

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,359
things we do

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,439
what do why are we doing this for

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,199
yeah so um

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,400
tech security

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,040
um part of the cncf you know we we have

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,960
i mean charters to kind of improve cloud

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
native security um create common tooling

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,000
uh making sure that we come together as

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
a community we work together we

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
define goals and kind of move towards

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,079
those as a community and to to make sure

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,320
that we collaborate on efforts so

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,559
besides the the usual things you know we

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,800
have our weekly meetings

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,800
um

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
um we have weekly meetings we have

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
presentations we have a ton of different

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,319
working groups um we have a lot of

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,600
different

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,760
projects so the way our community is

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,320
organized is all around github

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
you know we have folks coming in from

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,360
different

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
different areas with different expertise

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,640
whether you're someone that is um very

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
technical whether you're someone that

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
loves design loves um writing you know

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
there's a place for everyone we do white

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,520
papers we do

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,799
catalogs and i think we'll go through

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
some of them soon right

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,200
so and it said like

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,920
talking and not doing is is the same as

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
doing nothing or learning and not doing

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,079
it's not

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,200
something you retain with you so

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,759
most of our work streams and initiatives

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,159
are centered around

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,720
artifacts that we can externalize and

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
share with the community that can

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
capture

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
the pension around security

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,719
as

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,600
as representative as as possible uh the

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,280
cloud native security white paper an

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
initiative led by brandon is a great

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,240
example of that

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
yeah we have um

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
a lot of what we do even the white paper

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
these are things that are like we like

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
to call them live documents right

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
everything that we turn out as a group

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,480
is kind of always evolving um you know

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,440
technology is moving really quickly so

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
everything in this paper is up in github

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
you can create a pr you can find

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
something cool maybe something new in

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
supply chain you know you want to add it

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
um you know feel free to just go ahead

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
and add what your thoughts and your

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,120
um

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
all the good stuff in there and if

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
you're here you clearly have an interest

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
in security

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
it that said security can be

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
intimidating particularly when we're

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
talking as

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
formal verification a very advanced

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,599
subject last talk we had

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,000
but we want to make it relatable we want

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
to lower the barrier of entry we want to

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,920
make it accessible that you can wrap

84
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,200
your head around the different projects

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,920
and have a good new user experience and

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
that you can shorten the path of well i

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,599
just learned from this open source

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
project checked out the code to hey

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
here's something that's running as a

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
production system in my organization is

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
anybody here not in the tag security

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
slack or or anything like that when you

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
raise your hands

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
um cool it's awesome we have a good

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
representation here but great to have

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,720
you join us because what the thing is

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,239
you'll find out a lot about you know

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,560
what's going on for in the cloud native

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
world but also from a security

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
perspective

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
um so we welcome you and you know we do

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
like andre said there's a lot of things

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
like white papers and there's also kind

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
of you know vulnerability assessments

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
and all those things you can volunteer

106
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
to do so please get involved

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,280
yeah and i um on top of what what pop

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
just said you know we have our mail

109
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
english stack is still like our main

110
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
communications

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,319
leadership team you know all the tls all

112
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,120
the co-chairs are very friendly um just

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,040
feel free to sack us

114
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,280
there's nothing that you know

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
um that's not there's no such thing as a

116
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
super dale anything that's too small

117
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,680
right every contribution really adds up

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,478
and

119
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,880
one of the things for example is we just

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,600
went by the supply chain catalog

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,199
that was actually one of our members

122
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,840
santiago who was like oh i want to do

123
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
this really cool thing and then the the

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
leadership team were like yeah it sounds

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
like a good idea let's about it and this

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,680
is now one of our

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
main activities and this is something

128
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,960
that folks continues to contribute to

129
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
to paraphrase the the great ian

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,759
coldwater often it's more about showing

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,120
up

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
sometimes we don't know where to get

133
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
started how to contribute but people you

134
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
see as leaders in the community are

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
people who attend the meetings

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,120
have particular interest or passion to

137
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,240
tackle something and they go for that

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
and then they might move to something

139
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,800
else i was really bummed about tiffany

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
jordan and john shell who had a session

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
on the schedule accidental security

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
leaders

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
of their journey of how they found

144
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
themselves

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
driving strategy and secure software

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
supply chain as a matter of just being

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
part listening to the conversations

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
helping other folks navigate that

149
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
so yeah just flip super quick through

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,720
other things we do uh degrees

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
the great ian coldwater also said look

152
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880

153
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,280
the croatian sun for

173
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,400
a couple of weeks um yeah i mean again

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,759
just to amplify some of the things you

175
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,600
guys said

176
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,639
joining

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,080
the meetings and like seeing these

178
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
people who've like published papers and

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
like done security research can be

180
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
really intimidating but it is just about

181
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,800
showing up

182
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,199
contributing and actually listening to

183
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,479
what people

184
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,680
listening to how people think is so

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,440
instructive to understand

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
where they

187
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,319
sort of derived their security

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
perspective from a lot of the threat

189
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,600
modelling things that the group

190
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,039
generates are just

191
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,720
preeminent really really again very

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,960
insightful um

193
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
yeah and i have to thank my team at

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
control plane for all the hard work

195
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
they've done on the ctf we've had i

196
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,039
think up to like 10 people rotating in

197
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,000
and out

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,520
we um ended up with about 60 60 players

199
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,400
of the game if anybody would like a

200
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,880
special edition i believe

201
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
from from the artistic hand of emily

202
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
herself

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,479
yeah special edition stickers to certify

204
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,360
uh playing ctf i've got i've got a bunch

205
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
so please do please do come and tap me

206
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,160
up

207
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,919
and um

208
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,520
yeah a few people asked if they can kind

209
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
of play the scenarios another time

210
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
we will do another kind of community

211
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,319
flavored uh version of this because

212
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,639
i think this was some of them were a

213
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,240
little bit maybe a little bit crazy

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,759
difficult um

215
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
our red team uh i left them alone for a

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
week and um yeah they tried to build

217
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,039
like engagement realistic uh scenarios

218
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,680
so i will do something again um just

219
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,400
just taps up somehow uh on twitter or

220
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
whatever and we'll

221
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
i guess we'll put an invite out in uh

222
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
insect security as well um because

223
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,199
there's another three challenges of kind

224
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,479
of uh

225
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,639
uh increasing difficulty

226
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,160
there's there's a question i'd like to

227
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
ask you so people typically leave

228
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,919
security con or the ctf super excited

229
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,360
they geeked out

230
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
they come back to work and they struggle

231
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
to

232
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
relate this to other people and convince

233
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,280
them of how to bring this like what

234
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
advice do we have for folks what to

235
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
reference what can they reuse what can

236
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,319
they bring home and to the workplace

237
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,680
with them

238
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,879
that's an excellent question and it

239
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,759
seems like a perfect segue for the book

240
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,280
so i've just written the book called

241
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
hacking kubernetes if you really want to

242
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
scale your managers it's full of all the

243
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,760
cvs it's full of all the bypasses

244
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
and that comes out on

245
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,519
ah i think it's going into print today

246
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
so it'll be on o'reilly in the next sort

247
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,799
of three weeks it's there on early

248
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
access too

249
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,120
i think using real world examples to

250
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
demonstrate

251
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,240
actually one of the things i've had to

252
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,760
do in my career as a consultant a lot of

253
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
times was

254
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
to actually demonstrate cvs to have a vm

255
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
on the right kernel version to say oh

256
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
look you can

257
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
um like the run c breakout for example

258
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
containers are not impenetrable

259
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
um it's the same for hypervisors like

260
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,880
everything has been attacked but you

261
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
just need to get

262
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
often people with no kind of hands-on

263
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,240
experience into the headspace where they

264
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
can see there are viable chains of

265
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,000
attacks

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,399
uh or computers are broken

267
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
shut down the internet

268
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
so we're gonna hand it over to uh to

269
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
brandon to talk about security assesses

270
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
we're almost done we're almost done

271
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,640
all right so uh one of the the

272
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,959
activities our group does um and this

273
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,959
just started early way early on i think

274
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,120
this was more than two years we've been

275
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,160
doing this as security assessments

276
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
the idea behind security assessments is

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
we want to help

278
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
you know evaluate the security posture

279
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
of the different cncf projects we want

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
to be able to provide a kind of

281
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
perspective of how they fit into the

282
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
cognitive security ecosystem and kind of

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
the security concerns coming from a

284
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
uh adoption standpoint you know if i'm

285
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
interested in something like oppa i'm

286
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,200
interested in using something like

287
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,399
custodian

288
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,480
how does it fit within the cognitive

289
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,279
ecosystem within my deployment uh what

290
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,680
are the security considerations threat

291
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
models i should be thinking about

292
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,640
so these security assessments help

293
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
projects kind of think about security

294
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,240
help them produce a document that they

295
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
can then share with others

296
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,959
part of this is also you know all the

297
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,600
reviewers that are doing this also part

298
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
of the community

299
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
this is something that we keep doing we

300
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,199
have argo coming up we have captain

301
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,200
yeah so we we have um a ton of

302
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
interesting reviews coming up it's a

303
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
very a very fun process it's like two

304
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
two three weeks intensive go through the

305
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
project um back and forth with the

306
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
project maintainers if it's a project

307
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
that you've been wanting to find out but

308
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
you know haven't had the time it's a

309
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,959
good like um two weeks get in there go

310
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,399
really deep and then

311
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
write a bunch of things about it

312
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,920
so we are always looking for more

313
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,560
reviewers uh feel free to just mention

314
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
on slack say that i want to review

315
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,079
something i'm interested

316
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,959
um

317
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,160
you know

318
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,839
you don't have to be really deep

319
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
technically um it really is about you

320
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
know assessing the security posture

321
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,480
overall the of the project

322
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,800
another way that audits

323
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
are extremely helpful is it's really

324
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,920
easy to check out code from github and

325
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,720
do a proof of concept with it but it's a

326
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
really hard job to convince your

327
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,399
security peers

328
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,800
of what are the failure modes of this

329
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,959
technology when put in place into our

330
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,040
infrastructure what are the security

331
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
attributes what are the compensating

332
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,160
controls

333
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
so we try to front load that for the

334
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,839
community

335
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,800
so

336
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,079
we

337
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,040
really scrutinize all the security

338
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,160
aspects

339
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,320
we produce documentation we produce a

340
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
threat model we

341
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
help certify the projects towards the

342
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
core infrastructure best practices batch

343
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,959
to attest that they follow secure

344
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,760
software development best practices

345
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,240
and we we provide a lot of consideration

346
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,639
around sharp edges so

347
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
if you're looking to adopt any of these

348
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,480
uh

349
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
really like bleeding edge

350
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
sharp security tools uh we want to make

351
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,079
that well easy for you and and make sure

352
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,880
that it doesn't stall within an internal

353
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,639
audit or review because well as a

354
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,760
community

355
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
others have gone through this process

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
and we're all crowdsourcing that that

357
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,160
knowledge

358
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,000
uh there's opportunity for career

359
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,959
development uh we help out the cncf and

360
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,959
developing certifications most recently

361
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,839
we did the cks with them i see some

362
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,519
faces on the audience who've taken the

363
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,480
test uh another great opportunity to

364
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
showcase your expertise and help other

365
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,000
folks like

366
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
up level their skill set look i mean

367
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,560
there is a survey that was done there's

368
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
a skills gap i mean the the linux

369
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,519
foundation did out there it's like 90 7

370
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,519
of employers say they can't find folks

371
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,360
with open source experience

372
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
if you don't have these certifications

373
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
you are less marketable than you would

374
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,839
be otherwise so please explore these as

375
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,399
options we get i get nothing for for

376
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,680
saying anything about that but at the

377
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,880
end of the day it's cks ckas ckds all

378
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,240
those things are good things for your

379
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,560
careers

380
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
you do okay i'll kick it i'll kick it

381
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,120
back to you dude uh we we like to keep

382
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,839
our finger on the pulse and restate our

383
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,920
assumptions uh

384
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
what's the actual state of things are

385
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,920
these technologies actually getting the

386
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
traction that we presume they they are

387
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
because we're so close to the problem

388
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,279
so

389
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,399
we survey the ecosystem often hear a

390
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,639
couple lengths of of the survey surveys

391
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
that are put out there yeah one of them

392
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,399
was actually released today it talks

393
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,680
about um some of the concerns um today

394
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
around you know not only just supply

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,600
chain you talk about vulnerability

396
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,839
management secret measurement it also

397
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,079
talks a little bit about age security

398
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,800
and what's important so this this is

399
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,720
hall of the press today

400
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
um

401
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,800
yeah yeah

402
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
so awareness through effort that's

403
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
that's all that we're really after for

404
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,320
uh

405
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,360
we understand the pressure the risk

406
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,920
that it that was our very last slide i

407
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320

408
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,040

so i want to kind of end this kind of

418
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,120
like we started um security is not a

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
single vendor

420
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,360
it's not a single project

421
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,279
it takes a community

422
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,760
to look at these look at security as a

423
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,279
whole and be able to address these

424
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,320
