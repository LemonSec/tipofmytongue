1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
so thank you very much uh first thank

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,400
you for pronouncing my name right that's

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,279
that's probably a first in an event um

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,240
that's why they're paying me the big

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
bucks

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,639
so my name is yuval joy i'm the head of

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,400
product management with checkpoint for

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
everything cloud security uh what i do

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,279
want to discuss today is you know back

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,359
to how we started the event like the the

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,720
cost of

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
cyber threat to us

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,359
is in a place where we just have to do

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,039
something else and i'll talk about this

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,279
something else for me

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,280
everything that we do today

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,320
has to include some kind of automation

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
some kind of

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,320
capability that is not part of just man

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,440
work and women working on something we

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
have to really

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,160
shift

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
left

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,120
by also shifting into a more ai ml

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
focused cyber security capabilities and

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,399
it is within our

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,960
thoughts and it's within our

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
processes and it's within our

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
products that we use and develop so

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,600
before delving into this let me just

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,360
kind of make sure that we all understand

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
what what's really keeping

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
security people

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,000
up at night and first it's a lot about

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
visibility i'm an old school guy

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,360
i was a ciso of service providers back

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
in the days where a pizza box

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,240
wasn't just something you bring pizza in

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,560
but it was a one-u server and in order

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
to save to understand what's happening

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
you just needed to map the wirings right

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,840
you knew what's connected where we don't

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
have this visibility we do not know

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,280
where our

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
crown jewels are so how can we protect

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,759
what we cannot see

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,200
next

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,720
and this is the developer conference

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,240
right there are a lot of developers and

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,960
devops people here

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,560
how do security people keep still

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,520
their

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,560
values and you know are they really

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
valuable for the organization and the

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,759
reason is that

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,840
back in the old days

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,239
security peeps were involved in

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,720
designing systems as they were just

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,640
thought about in today's in a lot of

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,440
cases we see the devops team and the

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,920
developers team coming and say

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,200
we're ready to go production please

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,160
secure this right so this is this is

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
actually like am i still valuable for

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
the organization question

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
next is complexity

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
just think about how complex

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,599
for someone who is not part of the

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
devops community not part of the

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,519
developer community community to

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,840
understand the differences even from a

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,480
technology but also from a

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,519
risk perspective of vms versus

74
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
kubernetes containers versus serverless

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,800
functions et cetera et cetera last but

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
not least and this is something that did

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,720
not change ever since day one of

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
information security is how do i keep

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,519
myself off

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,239
the

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,159
wall street journal headline this is

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,400
like the number one concern

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
how hard is it

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,720
when and i'm not

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,959
i'm not calling developers

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,560
you know

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
non-knowledgeable or

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
but they do not understand security

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
always right and how do i make sure that

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
there are no mistakes done on the left

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
side because we're shifting left how do

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,760
i make sure that we're not making

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,399
mistakes there

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
so

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
the use of machine learning in ai

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,599
is

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,799
really

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
critical in order to grab so much

99
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,159
information and make it actionable and

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,000
make it something that

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
is insightful and a lot of times i hear

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,879
people say i'm getting so much data but

103
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
it's like finding a million needles in a

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,599
wheat field right that's that's one of

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040
the challenges that we see today so this

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
is why we need to use ai

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
the more data

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,239
and i'm sure you know that the more data

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
you feed to the machine learning beast

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
the accurate it's going to get last but

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
not least

112
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,560
if your organization still thinks

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
that

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
we could use all tools to solve new

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
world problems

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
it is not

117
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,640
going to solve these problems we have to

118
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
use new solutions

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,399
and those new solutions what i suggest

120
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,839
is really look into machine learning and

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,400
ai in order to solve these problems

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,919
now let's take you know a scene like a

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,320
day in a lifetime of a security person

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
working with devops and and developing

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
engineers first question is oh okay

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
you're asking me to secure this

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
kubernetes cluster what network traffic

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
is happening in between the cluster

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
nodes what's happening in between you

130
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,880
know east west nor north south

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
and the answer is usually well um i

132
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,040
don't know like we don't have any policy

133
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,199
right and then the security person talk

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,919
about the old world solution uses the

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,280
number one

136
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,440
advanced analysis tool

137
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
in the security

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
policy

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
analysis

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
arena which is an excel sheet and let's

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
get all the logs into an excel sheet and

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
crunch it and find the unique

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,639
connections and this is how i'm going to

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,160
build my

145
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,639
my solution it does not scale it does

146
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,960
not respond well to changes what do we

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
do differently and this is exactly where

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
i want to turn into a small demo and

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
again i just want to really show you how

150
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
could you harness

151
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
ai in order

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
to

153
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,120
create a security policy model so what

154
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
you see here you know a very simple very

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
traditional

156
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
almost three-tier if we're still allowed

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,039
to use this term

158
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,240
application

159
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
with you know a front end an application

160
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
set of capabilities and then maybe a

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,840
more secure system so how do i know what

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
different relationship from a networking

163
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
perspective do i need what we will do is

164
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
we'll actually use a discovery agent to

165
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
first understand what assets do i have

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
which is also we talked about visibility

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,039
i don't know what service do i have

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,160
right

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
and the first thing and i'm not going to

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
go through you know how it's installed

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
et cetera et cetera the first thing and

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
discovery agent would do is map the

173
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
different nodes the different pods the

174
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,319
different services etc etc

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,240
very limited visibility right only one

176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
namespace because nothing still happened

177
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
but once we turn on

178
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
learning mode

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,720
we could actually start understanding

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
what's happening in between the nodes

181
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,600
and build a policy model it's not just

182
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
let me record this but really build a

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
policy model and yes there are things

184
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,000
that we could statically you know do

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
from day one i don't want my my system

186
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
to go to malicious domains right but

187
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
still i want machine learning to

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
actually tell me what's happening inside

189
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
my my system so once

190
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
you turn machine learning in order to

191
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,319
build the the

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,720
security policy

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,039
you're going to start seeing and this is

194
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,599
i think the beauty of machine learning

195
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
is going to grow as you go it's going to

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
be very coarse at first

197
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,880
and then it's going to and it's going to

198
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
tell us listen you're at high school now

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,479
you need to keep learning until you get

200
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,000
to a professorship

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
you know position in terms of like i

202
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,759
know everything that's happening there

203
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,720
but the more you go it's it's giving you

204
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
it it understands now like what name

205
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
spaces are being used it understands now

206
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
the actual connections and relations

207
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
between the things now maybe it's not as

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,199
colorful as the diagram we saw at first

209
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
but these are the network vectors that

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
you see

211
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,039
so once we have this we can also start

212
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,720
looking at the policy model that it

213
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,759
suggests and the suggestion of course

214
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,919
again new world we can't use ip

215
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,440
addresses as

216
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,599
security policy constructs but instead

217
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,800
things like

218
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
pod names and resource names right in

219
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
services et cetera et cetera so what we

220
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
saw here in a matter of hours getting

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
from not knowing nothing about the

222
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,319
network traffic and knowing exactly what

223
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
security policy

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
we need and everything is courtesy of

225
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,240
machine learning that built really the

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,319
model you you're changing you're adding

227
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,639
a node you're adding a pod it will

228
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
relearn everything so you can always use

229
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
machine learning again and again

230
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
let's look at another scene

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,000
another scene where someone is

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
you know needs to understand what's the

233
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,680
permission model that is needed right

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,919
and you go to like devops engineer

235
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,680
developer engineer and they say well we

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
don't know it's a it's a it's an s3

237
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,120
bucket that is pre-configured by a

238
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,159
third-party tool that we're using right

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,120
you cannot secure black box you cannot

240
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,559
you need to really understand what the

241
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,120
permission levels are so in order to do

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
so let's see how do we use

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,600
machine learning in order to again build

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,120
a permission model not a network

245
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,560
security model but instead of permission

246
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,440
model

247
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,800
so

248
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
first thing that when you have in this

249
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
case it's a serverless function

250
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
that you can see is like okay what

251
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
different resources do i use but by the

252
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
way there are cases where

253
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
engineers don't even know exactly what's

254
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
being used because it's a third-party

255
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
tool but also when they build it if they

256
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
don't document everything they just

257
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,839
don't know

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,720
after using machine learning static code

259
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
analysis etc

260
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
we could understand

261
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,920
two models

262
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
the configured model

263
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
and because we're calculating all the

264
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,560
paths that the code could take

265
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,680
what is the required security model and

266
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
it will tell you listen your s3 bucket

267
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
is currently overly open and you need to

268
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,760
shut it down

269
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,560
now

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
try to go to a

271
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
developer and tell them reduce the

272
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
permissions on the s3 bucket and they're

273
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,399
going to say well what does it mean i

274
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
want to be able to do everything i do

275
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
right and the benefit of using

276
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
machine learning in order to build a

277
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
policy model

278
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
is that not only tells you what's needed

279
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
it empowers the security people to speak

280
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,000
the lingo

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
of devops and developers in order to

282
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,279
even give them a yaml snippet in order

283
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
to configure the resource so again in a

284
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
matter of a minute and a half just

285
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
running the the function once twice 10

286
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
times the more you run it the more

287
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,920
accurate you get you get from i have no

288
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,160
idea what's happening to a you know i

289
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
know everything everything there

290
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,160
so let's summarize

291
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
remember

292
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
especially if you're a developer or from

293
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,519
the devops community

294
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,440
the more data you send to the security

295
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
guys

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,800
doesn't mean that you're giving them

297
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
more visibility or more insights and

298
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
this has to be something that you we

299
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,959
always remember

300
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
you have to create a situation where you

301
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
have insights

302
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
the uh the second thing is

303
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
that

304
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
the more information you actually feed

305
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
to machine learning unlike a person that

306
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,440
just need to read to read a you know an

307
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,320
audit log the more information you feed

308
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,079
then

309
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
the more accurate your beast would be we

310
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
live in a world where we're not looking

311
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,279
for a needle in a haystack

312
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,480
we do not

313
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,279
advance persistent threats are here to

314
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,839
stay we're going to see them even more

315
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
and we're looking for million needles

316
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,839
in a wheat field it's not just a stack

317
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,320
right think about where where your

318
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
system is distributed across multiple

319
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
cloud service providers how do you

320
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,560
understand what's what's happening there

321
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,839
and with that i'll thank you thank you

322
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,180
very much

323
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,849
[Applause]
