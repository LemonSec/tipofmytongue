1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,399
so

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,120
how many of you here are familiar with

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,599
you know i hate switching tools too i've

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,400
gotten so used to uh google slides

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,720
and here i am in powerpoint

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,640
so how many of you have heard of magic

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,279
eye illusions

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,840
only f yeah fair amount fair amount so

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,480
magic eye is actually a company and this

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
is a trademarked thing

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
so but it turns out there's a free tool

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,559
that you can use to build these for

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,920
yourself

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,239
so i used this free tool

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,800
to create this particular illusion right

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,160
so there's

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,320
images there's an image hidden behind

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,480
this now i also learned that it's

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,800
actually really hard to see these on a

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,399
computer screen

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
so if i'd learned that soon enough i

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,079
would have printed out versions for

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
everybody to try and use yourself but

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,000
you know when the slides are posted if

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you feel like it you can print

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
um and take a look it also turns out

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
that not everybody

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
is able to actually see

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
the images that are in a magic eye

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,400
illusion

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
and that's because not everybody's eyes

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
work well together

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
and to see everything it's kind of a

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
stereogram to see this you really need

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
to have your eyes work well together and

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,360
to have them work well with the brain

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
and i think of this as being really

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
apropos for how we need to work together

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
to deliver cloud native security right

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
so we have to think

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
from the security perspective that's

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,720
really important and it is absolutely

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,680
true

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
that not all developers understand that

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
and we have to think about it from the

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
app developer perspective and the

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
business needs as well

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,560
and it's a balancing act it's a risk

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
management act to figure out

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
how do i meet the business needs which

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,240
include a good security posture while

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,200
also enabling the app dev team to do

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
what they need to do

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,759
and to deliver quickly

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,280
so

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
also there's this ever expanding

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,879
guidance that is coming at all of us

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,120
you know nist 800 190 that's been out

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
there for a while

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,280
cncf open source to kubernetes security

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
audit in 2019

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
awesome really great content and there's

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
another one in progress right that i

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,239
hope we'll see in 2022.

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,400
there's guidance from analysts like

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
gartner right we need to think

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,160
differently about how we protect cloud

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
workloads especially since they're

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
ephemeral and they move around as was

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
noted right we're not we're not dealing

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
with ip addresses

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
there's the new executive order which

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
has created this intense focus on the

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,160
need to create software bill of material

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
and the way to create um and and to

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
improve security in your supply chain

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,040
again some great talks yesterday if you

78
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,280
didn't get to the supply chain security

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,159
con

80
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,040
watch the recordings and then of course

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
the nsa sisa guidance for hardening

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
kubernetes honestly it overlaps a good

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,560
bit with the cis kubernetes hardening

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
guide that's great

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,360
but it's a lot for everybody to absorb

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,519
and when you kind of look at this and

87
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
put it all together

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
i do think that the guidance really

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
comes down to

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
the need for a devsecops approach

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,200
to securing both the platform

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,799
and the workloads that run on the

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,239
platform

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
right we need to control application

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,879
security in the ci cd process

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,959
we need to protect the platform at

97
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,599
deploy time the platform

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,680
ensuring that it's configured correctly

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
kubernetes is complex

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,200
also ensuring that you've got

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,760
protections in place to check workloads

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
as they're deployed

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
and then we know that we can't avoid

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,879
every there are unknown threats

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,959
so we do need that visibility that

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
observability that we just heard about

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,280
earlier to help us detect and respond to

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
runtime threats

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,400
and part of that response one of the

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,239
things i see kind of when i talk to

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
people about devsecops

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,199
i see a lot of emphasis on shift left

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
which is important

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,839
but i think of that as devsec right a

115
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
lot of that focus is how do i integrate

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
security tools

117
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
into my ci cd pipeline there's sort of

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,520
this assumption that secops right we

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
kind of know what we're doing

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
and yet it's really true that kubernetes

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
and declare the declarative environment

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,880
the fact that containers are ephemeral

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,199
even if it's a long-lived workload

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
sorry you can um

125
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,880
that that

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
where that pod is deployed can change

127
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
right so you can never fix a running

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
container you need to rebuild and

129
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
redeploy

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
which really means that we have to think

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,960
through

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
how do we close that devsecop loops how

133
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,840
do we feed that information back to the

134
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,799
development team

135
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
so

136
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
red hat has done this survey

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
on contain on the state of kubernetes

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
security

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
and one of the things we hear and i've

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
also actually seen it in survey results

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
from idc

142
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
a lot of people

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
say that they are doing devsecops that

144
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,639
they have strong debt secops adoption

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
now i think that that's true for

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
folks who are more on the bleeding edge

147
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
and i think that enterprises who are

148
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
still in their cloud adoption journey

149
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
may think they're doing devsecops but

150
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
they're really just kind of doing that

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
shift left i've got vulnerability

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
scanning in my ci process

153
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
and that's about the extent of it

154
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
so i think

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
you know one of the things we really

156
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
have to think about

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
is how can we as a community

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,880
help organizations

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
demystify

160
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,360
what they need to do but also help and

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
and operationalize their use of

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,720
cloud-native workloads but also kind of

163
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
we're all here looking at a lot of

164
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,639
different capabilities a lot of new

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,479
tools and things that we can do to

166
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,318
address these key requirements

167
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
but that comes with its own set of

168
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,919
complexity

169
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,479
right so we need to be thinking about

170
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,960
not just technology and tools

171
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,039
we need to be thinking about processing

172
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,520
people as well so how do we help ensure

173
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,560
that that process is agile and how do we

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,840
help the companies that we support

175
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
future proof what they're doing

176
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,120
think about solutions that can apply no

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
matter where somebody is running

178
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,680
kubernetes or their container workloads

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
or their cloud workloads right a cloud

180
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
can be on premises

181
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,240
as well as in public cloud providers

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
so

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
technology people process all of these

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
remain key

185
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,520
and it's important that we think about

186
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
the people in the process as much as the

187
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,039
technology

188
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,720
so some of the future investments again

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,880
i love this that this community is

190
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
investing

191
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,479
uh in many many different ways right

192
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,039
when it comes to application integrity

193
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
and that ci cd process

194
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
the sig store project has just kind of

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
exploded how many of you are familiar

196
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,800
with sig store

197
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
right so one of the things i love about

198
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,360
sig store is how it makes it simpler for

199
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
the a tool chain to sign artifacts as

200
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
the artifacts are moving through the

201
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,400
tool chain most signing solutions that

202
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
enterprises are used to using aren't

203
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
designed to be work to to be used in a

204
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,319
pipeline

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,240
it also includes a transparency

206
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,400
signature log right the recourse so that

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,680
you can check

208
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,599
and make sure that and verify your

209
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,039
signature

210
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,560
tech on cd chains again another way to

211
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
kind of document and log how things have

212
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
gone through the process

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,720
encrypted containers storing and running

214
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
encrypted containers adds to

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,879
uh the ability to manage application

216
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,440
security and then rootless builds right

217
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,879
there are many there are some build

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
solutions that require you to have

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599
privileges to build that container image

220
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,280
be much better if you didn't need to do

221
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,800
that especially if you're running your

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,759
builds

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
on kubernetes

224
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
integrity integrity for the platform how

225
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,120
do i attest the host the nodes in my

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,639
cube cluster

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
how do i uh invest in

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,279
things like kubernetes support for user

229
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,640
namespaces

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
this is something that you know we've

231
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
been talking about for a while it hasn't

232
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,080
been delivered yet

233
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
and you know there's still conversations

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
ongoing about the complexity required

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
there but most of the customers i talk

236
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,839
to are looking for that additional

237
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,040
protection because it's really hard

238
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
especially in certain verticals as they

239
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
move workloads to the cloud

240
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
some of them need privileges this this

241
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
they aren't able to re-architect

242
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
everything to be truly micro-service

243
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
based or cloud-native and so in

244
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,000
particular in telco is you see

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
containerized native network functions

246
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
delivered

247
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,000
those often require the ability to for a

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,920
certain level of privilege that is

249
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,600
better protected with user name spaces

250
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
and then also honestly one of the

251
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
biggest attack vectors for any kube

252
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,240
cluster is the cluster admin privs

253
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,480
and this is a place where we don't yet

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,600
have

255
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
genuine separation between the control

256
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
plane and the data plane and this is an

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
area that red hat's investing in and i i

258
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
would love to see the community invest

259
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,839
in as well

260
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
with the runtime again deep

261
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
observability as was mentioned earlier

262
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
absolutely key

263
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
and the ability to use that data that's

264
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,959
collected to automate response to what

265
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,120
you discover not just network policy

266
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,959
which is a great thing to help automate

267
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,480
it confuses

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,800
uh our network security teams how do

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
they get visibility how do they

270
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,519
understand

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,880
also

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
automated response to vulnerabilities in

273
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,760
the runtime environment and a better

274
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,440
risk assessment right are those

275
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,600
vulnerabilities in pods that are

276
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
actually exposed to the network or not

277
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
what's my level of risk so that i can

278
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
really

279
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
kind of triage those things better

280
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,320
and then

281
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,640
so active recommendations really key

282
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,200
and and again just that ability to

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
respond

284
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,839
um

285
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,480
we look to the community to help deliver

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
on all of these things again lots of

287
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
great work happening

288
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
and i think one of our big challenges is

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
going to be how do we help our customers

290
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
our end users

291
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,160
operationalize

292
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,079
everything that we talk about everything

293
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
that we're working on have them work

294
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,279
together

295
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,680
as a as a whole solution and how do we

296
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
help them bridge

297
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,399
the silos that still exist

298
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,160
between the different teams security ops

299
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
app dev

300
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
right that's that's a people thing

301
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
that i think we should be thinking about

302
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,519
as well

303
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,959
so that's it for me thank you very much

304
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,560
and um

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
not sure what

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
whether we have time for questions or

307
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,760
somebody's up next

308
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,819
[Applause]
