1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,520
you want to hear 20 minutes uh on uh

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,880
modern least privilege does that sound

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,960
interesting

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,639
okay that's not too old school of a term

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,440
to bring up

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,040
[Music]

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
awesome i don't like spamming people so

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,799
i always do for a lot of like thumbs up

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,359
thumbs down uh to make sure that people

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,880
want to hear more words before i say

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,760
them

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,640
so hopefully that will go well

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
so i'm james and you know basically i've

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
been rattling around the the cloud

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
native community or the modern

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
application community for the better

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,800
part of a decade and going on more now

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,360
and you know the the experiences i want

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,760
to share and where i'm helping drive

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,440
this set of products at vmware called

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
tanzu

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
it really orients around the idea that

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,440
we have a new paradigm around modern

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
applications that introduces new ways of

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,680
doing security in addition to new ways

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
of doing development operations so i'm

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
pretty excited about the overall term of

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
devsecops in some ways it you know it's

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,960
not a perfect term but it galvanizes

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
this unification

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,719
of uh you know these

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,400
these roles in a way that i think is

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,438
important

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,280
and you know i've been with leaders of

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
large organizations the days or weeks

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
after major security breaches happen

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,720
and a lot of my thinking was heavily

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,000
influenced

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
um sitting with the head of a bank with

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,439
about an eight billion dollar technology

41
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,640
budget

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
you know maybe a month after the equifax

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
breach happened

44
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,080
and you know he looked up at me at

45
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,439
dinner he's like you know if that

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
happens to us i have to sit in front of

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
congress

48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
and he basically said like could we come

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
up with a plan so that that would not be

50
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,280
the default in my organization because

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
it's not fun to run around tasking

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
people constantly to turn the wheels

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
like how can we make

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
modern security more of an affordance of

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
an overall platform or system that i run

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
as an organization and less of a

57
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,799
potential

58
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,399
and a lot of what my passion in the

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
space is around is that like some of

60
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,079
these modern security principles need

61
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
not only be possible within the cncf

62
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,920
community they need to become

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
affordances

64
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,960
and i think that's sort of the

65
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,159
distinction

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
that i'm going to push on and maybe some

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,720
of my thoughts will be interesting and

68
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
so my ask and my call to action is like

69
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,319
if you agree with any of this help make

70
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,720
me smarter about it or help push it uh

71
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,319
because i think it can just you know

72
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,080
help us all in our day-to-day jobs does

73
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
that sound interesting as a topic

74
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,160
oh i got more than one thumb i'm gonna

75
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
keep talking

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
cool so i use the term devsecops i'm not

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
really here to get in a big semantic

78
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,879
debate if it's the cool thing if we

79
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,160
think of another way of making

80
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
affordances security first class

81
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,000
performance of a platform i'll use it

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
but that's what i got today

83
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
and i think part of the observation of

84
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,800
modern applications

85
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,920
was that they weren't quite as static

86
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,440
so i think if you think about the

87
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
evolution of a platform like instagram

88
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
it was sort of a failed startup that

89
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,599
discovered this human interaction of

90
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,440
applying a filter gave people the

91
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
audacity to post their filters their

92
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
photos maybe 100x more often

93
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
and that wasn't something you could sit

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
down in a room with accenture and write

95
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
a spec out for an app it was sort of an

96
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,120
experimental emergent process

97
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
and i think that's my mental model when

98
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,879
i think of modern applications is that

99
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,480
they have emergent properties that

100
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,239
require iteration

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,920
and so as all of these large

102
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
organizations are going agile and

103
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
discovering the business impact of

104
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,599
emergent properties of applications

105
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,440
they're becoming more iterative

106
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,760
and that speed of iteration really to me

107
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,519
is the big change from like maybe the

108
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,000
old model i'm old enough that i was

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
alive in the 90s and some people today

110
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
were not um and in the 90s i started

111
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,599
working at a big iron you know tech

112
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,840
company called sun and every year we

113
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,519
would deploy a server

114
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,680
anywhere in that very old school mode in

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
fact my first day there was like

116
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,879
watching a customer do a six week

117
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
consulting agreement to size a server

118
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
six weeks to size the server so i've

119
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,000
really lived this evolution from large

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,599
static process driven it to more of this

121
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,319
iterative emergent cloud pattern but i

122
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,920
do think that iterative emergent pattern

123
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
is super interesting and so i think just

124
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
the same way the applications change we

125
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,959
can change security in this new world

126
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:05,920
and i'm going to push on a couple

127
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,640
dimensions of that

128
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,920
but i do like to study history a bit and

129
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,560
so as we're you know kind of suddenly

130
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
there's this craze around i was super

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,399
excited to see all the secure supply

132
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,399
chain work yesterday that whole it has

133
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
its own conference now

134
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
uh devstech ops is the hot term

135
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
everywhere i go and it's sort of like

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
wait a minute you know if i read my

137
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
computer history journals

138
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
it was 1974 that we were pretty clear

139
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,720
that everything on a system should have

140
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
as least privilege possible to execute

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
its task

142
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
and in some ways a lot of the systems we

143
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,199
have today are much more wide open than

144
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,160
that

145
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
and i think i traced that history back

146
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
to the innovations of the web

147
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
took a different turn

148
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,759
than the early system designs which were

149
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,400
largely backend systems for processes

150
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
they were much more collaboration

151
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
systems

152
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,039
and so while the 70s we were clear on

153
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
lease privilege

154
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
so anyway i'm going to go really fast

155
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
the the founder of yubikey basically

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,919
said think about the web as a different

157
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,280
paradigm the least privilege it was a

158
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
sharing first you know set of tech

159
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,199
everything is about sharing fast and i

160
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,440
see devsecops as this really exciting

161
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,919
new synthesis between least privileged

162
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,800
system design of the early era and these

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
collaboration technologies that we built

164
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,479
like http which are originally just like

165
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
here's my document everyone have it like

166
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
how do we bring those two together as a

167
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
modern ethos that's really what drives

168
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
me

169
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,400
um an example of those two forces at

170
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
play

171
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
is the cncf through some of the work

172
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
andreas has done has endorsed the cloud

173
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,479
native build packs

174
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
and in the early days it was sort of

175
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
like hey everyone grab a docker file and

176
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,039
push it to prod pull it from docker hub

177
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,280
and go and i do think that things like

178
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
build packs are a really nice

179
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
engineering design of reducing the

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
privilege of the system because by

181
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
default now everything is secure by

182
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
default so as opposed to saying to that

183
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,800
developer you need to always scan and do

184
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
all these things with your app by hand

185
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,639
now you're saying there's a set of

186
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
automations that introduce mechanistic

187
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,840
least privilege to the pipeline and i do

188
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,039
think paying attention to things like

189
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,600
build packs is the first step so here's

190
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
some stuff i did in my previous

191
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
generation of technology it's more of a

192
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
closed system called cloud foundry but i

193
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,639
worked with a lot of banks

194
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,880
one bank runs about 500 000 containers

195
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,000
on this platform and here's what they

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
love about it

197
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
is that there are affordances of the

198
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
system which bake compliance into the

199
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
dev developer experience i.e the

200
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
developer has the surface area they need

201
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
to get their job done and everything

202
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,880
that they do by default is more secure

203
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,039
there's an ability to constantly repave

204
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,600
the platform so in the aftermath of

205
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
equifax

206
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,319
it was really a question of like we

207
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
can't wait 90 days to re-enter to rotate

208
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
credentials to repair things running in

209
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,479
production

210
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,440
and for frankly for machines to expire

211
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,039
and so we introduced all these things

212
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,560
into this platform and banks by and

213
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
large love it and my passion right now

214
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
is introducing that to the broader full

215
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
kubernetes community

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,919
um we're baking into our developer

217
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,800
experience we have something called the

218
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
tonzo application platform which will do

219
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,160
uh security scans signing etc by default

220
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
and

221
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
come talk to me more about this but

222
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
we're baking some of these security

223
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
processes right into the developer

224
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,759
experience and i think what's really

225
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,880
interesting

226
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
is that we're introducing i think more

227
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
of a decomposed set of templates that

228
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
allow you to express the semantics a

229
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
developer should see what the app

230
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,360
operations team should see and what core

231
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
cluster admins should see in a way that

232
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
allows you to decompose

233
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
what alders call a monolithic set of

234
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
pipelines some people run into more like

235
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,240
a microservice so that that developer

236
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
can reason about their surface area and

237
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
a lot more things are secure signed by

238
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
default i think asking developers to

239
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,840
reason about a 2000 function monolith is

240
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,599
as unreasonable as asking them to reason

241
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,520
about like a giant monolithic pipeline

242
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
with no abstraction for them that's my

243
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
observation and then we can bake

244
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
security into these things

245
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
um

246
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
and the final note i'll leave you with

247
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
is that an increasingly secure software

248
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,039
supply chain doesn't eliminate runtime

249
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,400
variants

250
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,160
and so you like i know exactly when it

251
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
went into prod and now it's running so

252
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
now what has it done since

253
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
and i think this is where the repaving

254
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
modality is so important is that the

255
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,479
ability now that you trust your software

256
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,479
supply chain and you have git ops

257
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,559
functionality to constantly recreate it

258
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,640
why not use that so why not make that a

259
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
first class part of the system and so

260
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,240
what i want to do with tanzu and we're

261
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,839
increasingly doing with technologies

262
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,080
like cluster api is introduce

263
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
programmatic affordances to constantly

264
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
repave the system to constantly repair

265
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
the system as vulnerabilities come out

266
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,360
and to constantly and this will take

267
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
some time rotate shared secrets

268
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,519
credentials etc

269
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,959
and therefore i think we can let me just

270
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
close on this we can really bring

271
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
together

272
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
um the two big trends that are happening

273
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
now once you have a secure software

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
supply chain and you have git ops

275
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
why not reduce runtime variants and why

276
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
not reduce bureaucratic overhead of

277
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
getting patching done by constantly

278
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
rebuilding that once you have systems

279
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
like k-native which are excellent at

280
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
doing first-class routing between

281
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
versions of applications and instances

282
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
of applications why not use that system

283
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
so that's my passion that's what i'm

284
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
working on and my call to action is

285
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,519
please help

286
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,440
thank you

287
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,600
all right
