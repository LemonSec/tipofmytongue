00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,560
native security day my name is dan

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,080
poppindram with cystic i'm the director

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,640
of open source community and ecosystem

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,800
i want to start us all out with a favor

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
what's up mark you said

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,960
it's hard to hear you okay there we go

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,640
welcome again to cloud native security

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,199
day everyone um so i wanted to start out

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
with a figure everyone

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
six excuse me 2.6 trillion dollars

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
that's how much the industry was caused

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
by cyber security issues in terms of

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,160
misconfiguration and security issues

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
no single vendor

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,840
no single project

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,399
no single group can address this but as

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
a community we can address this

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
so that's what i think with the the

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
power and the benefit of tag security is

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
being able to come together and address

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,800
things

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
as we have

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,640
very proud of um of what we do in tag

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
security we have an amazing group before

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320

thanks for being out here today the

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,960
first kubecon we had probably a little

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
bit more than the number of people we

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,280
have in this room we certainly had

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
security-minded folks in that in that

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,880
audience

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,320
but looking back the way we've come from

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
having a limited set of sharp tools to

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
safeguard our infrastructure

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,399
we have

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,160
evolved

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,959
drastically over that time

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
the technical advisory group started

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
early on

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
as the

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
special interest group for security of

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
cncf

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
organization we are a community driven

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
team of security professionals security

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,599
engineers who've been entrusted with

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,640
safeguarding cloud native infrastructure

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,599
we meet regularly we organize events uh

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,400

throughout the day is a

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,560
sample of all the activity and all the

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
progress made

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,519
resiliency realized is the theme of

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
the broader event this week but

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
without mitigating risk there is no

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
resiliency so

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,040
keeping that in mind and

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
with that just

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
