1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,639
greetings and salutations i want to

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,720
start by recognizing how disappointed i

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,440
am to not be doing this in person and

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
sharing this time and space with you but

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,200
we're going to make the most of it and

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,719
there's a lot to get through we only

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
have 20 minutes so so let's go i'm going

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,000
to start with a little bit of an

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
introduction about myself i'll shorten

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,080
the the long version of my stick here

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
but essentially been focused on open

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
source infrastructure automation going

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,400
back over 10 years

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
in parallel i've been working

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
in and around the devops community

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,920
and writing books and talking about

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,920
these kind of topics and then i joined

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
red hat about two years ago

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
this is just a picture of my peak

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
pandemic beard this has been shaved and

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,239
you can see we're almost back to that

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,920
and and just to kind of put this out

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,280
there if anyone wants to get a hold of

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
me uh linkedin or twitter that's

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
probably the fastest way and i come in

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,640
various configurations of hair and beard

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,199
and if you see me anywhere else uh in i

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,640
might look very different than i do

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
right now so with that being said i

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
would claim no expertise in security

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,199
i've been involved in lots of things

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,360
where security was a consideration but

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
it's never been my job my responsibility

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,720
my name on the line for security so take

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,000
everything i say with that as a context

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
what i would consider myself is an

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
aspiring pattern matcher and puzzle

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,439
solver and security has been a goal and

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,240
a constraint but it's never been exactly

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
the thing that i was 100 focus on so

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,799
with that i'm not going to talk about

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
all the buzzwords of the day the

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,200
buzzwords you know them there's lots of

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
other talks about them some of you are

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
probably working on them i would hope

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
most people listening to this know more

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
things or know more about these things

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,159
than i do

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,640
but that being said i'm not not talking

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
about those things either

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,479
what i'm really going to focus on is

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,479
kind of the dynamics of how

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,399
organizations

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,159
change their behavior so there's a

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,399
couple things that i think are really

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
not changed here in the sense that the

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,439
the basics are essentially

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
is there an identity that we can

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,840
authenticate against and then once we

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,239
have those identities authenticated is

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,720
that identity authorized to do whatever

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,319
they're trying to do

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,800
so you have this kind of who what when

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,879
thing that you both want to be able to

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,239
enforce and then also record

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
and this has not really changed like the

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,319
fundamentals of some of this stuff um in

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
my opinion isn't fundamentally changing

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,879
but what is changing is the the dynamics

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,480
of the tools and the dynamics of the the

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
problems we need to solve with respect

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
to scale um and the surface areas

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,840
so this is something that i think is

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
very exciting about the way a lot of

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
these tools are emerging is we're

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
getting into this world where instead of

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,840
the the theatrics of inspection we can

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,400
move into some

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,280
hope of a future where everything is is

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,040
verified by by cryptographic identity

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
and policies enforced based on that

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,040
identity instead of the sort of

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
theatrics that seem to dominate what

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,360
most people do for security today so

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,239
this is this notion of continuous you

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,440
know you have continuous everything

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
that's a buzzword which i'm gonna i'm

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,519
gonna use liberally

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,959
not just in this talk but in lots of

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
other talks so we want to get to this

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,319
world where everything is continuously

92
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,599
verified

93
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,239
so then back to the topic of the day or

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,720
the topic for at least this 20 minutes

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,519
is

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,840
there's this interesting question of how

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,799
you can

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,280
change from what you are to become this

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,599
new thing right so the legacy kind of

100
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,760
become cloud native and when you think

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,239
about that problem there's the legacy

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,560
applications which sit on the legacy

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
infrastructures but underpinning all

104
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,599
that and creating that in many ways

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,799
these things are a reflection of each

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
other you also have these legacy

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
cultures and i'm going to introduce an

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
idea here which isn't isn't something

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
i'm making up but there's this notion of

110
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
a socio-technical system it's not

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
technology alone that solves these

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
problems that develops or delivers the

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
imp applications the infrastructure of

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,879
the security it's that socio-technical

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,319
system that does so so you have to

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,599
address that

117
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,400
so

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,239
uh too long gonna read this talk is

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
basically the change is hard that's the

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,839
title that

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
the point i've already started to make

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
that security is

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
qualitative it's not a condition you're

124
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,240
not secure or insecure but but there's

125
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
qualities that are more secure and less

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,680
secure

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,600
those are qualities of a socio-technical

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
system you have to treat that system

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
as as a single thing if you think about

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,639
it purely as technical problem or purely

131
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,400
as a cultural problem you run into these

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,639
things where it's very difficult to to

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,720
to change or move past where you get

134
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,759
stuck and then this is sort of the new

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,360
kind of ideas i'm going to hopefully

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
introduce that you'll find interesting

137
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
and insightful is this notion of

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,639
collective interest and selfish interest

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,440
and how those come together and then

140
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
this is something i like to say and

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,440
sometimes i say it with swear words but

142
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,759
broken things tend to get fixed but

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,240
things are merely bad uh can can often

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,919
live forever so

145
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,600
you want to change the world we we all

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,039
want to change the world this is a

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,639
exciting time

148
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,000
we see all the advancements in

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,479
technology uh some sometimes we get to

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,039
make some of those and uh i just want to

151
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,759
remind you of some of the

152
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,240
some of the ideas from the past on this

153
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
topic so this is uh machiavelli who some

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
of you might have heard of and maybe one

155
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,680
day i'll give a talk that's just quotes

156
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,320
from philosophers and and uh these sort

157
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,120
of things but i want to point out that

158
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,639
the sentence i've made bold here so the

159
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,880
innovator has for enemies

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
all those who have done well under the

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,080
old conditions

162
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
i'll leave the rest of it and this is a

163
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,600
pretty famous thing but just think about

164
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,320
that

165
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,919
next time you're having conversations in

166
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,520
your organization about how to do the

167
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,000
new things and then related to that this

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
is this is from a different uh slightly

169
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
different time around the um the you

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
know the transition from classical

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
mechanics to quantum mechanics uh max

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,639
planck did some some foundational

173
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,400
seminal work there and and this is the

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
this is called plank's principle which

175
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
says that a new scientific truth does

176
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
not triumph by convincing its opponents

177
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
and making them see the light uh

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
but rather because its opponents

179
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
eventually die so the the simple version

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,919
of this is that science advances one

181
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
funeral at a time

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
there's another dynamic which i want to

183
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,319
point out which used to frustrate me in

184
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,520
a lot of the work i was trying to do

185
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
getting people to kind of adopt these

186
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,600
new ways of working and do things in a

187
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
better way

188
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
is that you you have this thing that

189
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
we're kind of a part of

190
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
innovating you know i think that's

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,919
something we can say is happening around

192
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
the the cloud native technology so

193
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,440
there's innovators there's early

194
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
adopters and when they're doing that

195
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
work when you're creating those new

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,520
things and you're adopting those new

197
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
things

198
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
you're actually focused on doing things

199
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
better getting an advantage and then

200
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,199
you see that advantage is demonstrated

201
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,720
you see this in sort of the state of

202
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
devos reports some of these other things

203
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
with with automation and then you get

204
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,440
into this early majority late majority

205
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
and you start to see this phenomenon

206
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,160
where people

207
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
don't actually adopt the real practices

208
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
or in some cases even the real tools but

209
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
they start using all the words and they

210
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,440
start changing all the titles and this

211
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
is this is studied um

212
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
as a phenomena

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,479
um which we don't have time to get into

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,639
all the research um here but

215
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,319
what ends up happening as you kind of

216
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,680
cross the chasm and come into the

217
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
majority is that these organizations are

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
not actually seeking an advantage

219
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
they're seeking legitimacy and the

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,080
legitimacy is because there's other

221
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
people who got the advantage but they're

222
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
not they're not seeking that they're

223
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,000
just seeking the words and that that's

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
enough for them they'll they'll just

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,599
take those titles and now they're sres

226
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,800
or whatever even though they change

227
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,599
nothing so where were we

228
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,720
this is a blog post from legacy andrew

229
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,599
in 2010 about what devops meant to me at

230
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,680
the time uh developers and operators can

231
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
should work together system

232
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
administration is evolving look more

233
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,560
like software development and it's this

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
is this is last but not least in some

235
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
ways most important is that this is

236
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,879
evolving together as a global community

237
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
sharing solutions and i think that's the

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
most exciting thing

239
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
i think that's also happening with with

240
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,879
cloud native and and for all intents and

241
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,720
purposes i feel like these are a

242
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,759
continuation of similar things right so

243
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,440
this is my definition of devops i've

244
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
used in many conference talks that it's

245
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
optimizing the human human experience

246
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
and performance of operating software

247
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
with software and with humans

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
which is important in a minute and just

249
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
a piece completely buzzword compliant

250
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
you know continuously devops micro

251
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,040
serverless uh we'll check a lot of boxes

252
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,279
for the day so related to this

253
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,920
definition that i use for devops is this

254
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
theme about software's eating the world

255
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,080
right like that is essentially arguing

256
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,880
that

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,279
software is optimizing everything it can

258
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,720
optimizing human performance and

259
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
experience and and devops is really just

260
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,279
an extension of that cloud native is is

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
a you know another level extension of

262
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,000
that and what we're seeing and what i

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,320
would think a lot of this community is

264
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
about is that software is actually

265
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,560
eating software right so we're seeing

266
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080
this sort of software software

267
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,680
platformification that's that's allowing

268
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,959
all of these things to happen and i'm

269
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
going to go into platforms

270
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
more and more deeply as we go but

271
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
the other thing that's happening and

272
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
this this is really the point of this

273
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
this subconference here is that software

274
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
is eating software security

275
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
so we have this this situation people

276
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,800
always say software's in the world i

277
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,959
don't think that's entirely true i think

278
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,560
there's a lot of other infrastructure

279
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,320
and circumstances support that so we

280
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
live in this time i'm speaking to you

281
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,240
through the internet

282
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
super computers everywhere connecting

283
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
all human knowledge with high-speed

284
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
networks

285
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,200
but it's also connecting all that to the

286
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
adversaries

287
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,519
and

288
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,360
i said this as my part of my definition

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
coming back to it every aspect of human

290
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
performance and experience that can be

291
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
optimized will be

292
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,760
including owning you

293
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
so with that in mind you know devsec ops

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
just to kind of rub

295
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
the same pattern on it and i'll say this

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
now i've said it before and we'll

297
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
surprise it again

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
devsecops is another buzzword of the day

299
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
and it's really adding that that

300
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,720
considers a consideration of security as

301
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
a first class um part of the equation so

302
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
security is involved

303
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
um to include and is included in

304
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,519
software development so the software of

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
security is looking more like more like

306
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
software development like with the life

307
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,640
cycle of software development and it

308
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
needs to be included in the rest of the

309
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
software development life cycle

310
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,399
and then here's the exciting part that

311
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,880
we're part of right now um like i said i

312
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
wish i was together with you and we

313
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
could do this a little bit more uh

314
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
personally but

315
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
reach out to me this is a global

316
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,440
community sharing solutions uh i'm sure

317
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
a lot of you have seen things i haven't

318
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
seen i'd like to hear about them and if

319
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,959
you want to know my opinion on anything

320
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,120
i'm not shy so reach out

321
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
so this is a very famous quote from

322
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,160
2006.

323
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
i'm just throwing in the middle of this

324
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,600
because i think i think it's relevant to

325
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,640
some of the

326
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
some of the themes and what we're

327
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,519
struggling with in a lot of these

328
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,640
organizations

329
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
and and i'm not gonna read the whole

330
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,279
thing today but you can you can read it

331
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,720
and i'll you know slides will be

332
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,920
available um but verner vogels 2006 you

333
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,200
build it you run it people say that all

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
the time they pull that all the time

335
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,160
okay that's cool

336
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,279
but uh

337
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
who who who's actually gonna secure it

338
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,800
uh

339
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,760
yeah that's uh might be a little bit of

340
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
a problem

341
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
and if you look at the big picture of

342
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
what verner's talking about

343
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
and what was it at amazon at that time

344
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,600
in 2006

345
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
burner doesn't mean that these

346
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,920
developers are going to provision

347
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,200
bare metal

348
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,959
you know get everything racked and

349
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,000
stacked

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,320
install operating systems install

351
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
libraries install and manage databases

352
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
that's not what he means at all what he

353
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,040
really needs is really that team of

354
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
software developers manages this this

355
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,399
top layer

356
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,120
so

357
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
i'm going to go back through this is

358
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
kind of like a reprisal of some classic

359
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
devops conversations

360
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
and this notion of traditional i.t being

361
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
a wall of confusion between developers

362
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
and operators and then i'm also going to

363
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
introduce uh some some research from my

364
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
colleague um javed in a minute so these

365
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,959
are two different games so you can kind

366
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,440
of think of devenops as trying to win

367
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
two slightly different games um let's

368
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
define what those are so this is uh

369
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
james working on his phd so he likes it

370
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,079
when people um reference his language

371
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
and this is related to his his phd

372
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,959
research so you have this notion of what

373
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,240
we'll start with and we'll call two

374
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,200
economies two different games to play on

375
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
the the left side

376
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,079
you have what we'll call the

377
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,920
differentiation economy this is about

378
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,240
innovation you win this game by creating

379
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
more novelty by creating new variations

380
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
um you win the the scale game and this

381
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,720
is not necessarily the words i would

382
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
have chosen but this is what's in the

383
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
literature and this is about efficiency

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,399
so you're reducing variation and this

385
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,800
isn't unique to it right this is just

386
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
the the nature of anything so if you're

387
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
trying to manufacture whatever you still

388
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
have this tension this conflict between

389
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,880
innovation and efficiency so

390
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
just to oversimplify you know back to

391
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
the dev and ops divide you have create

392
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,959
more value drive down costs

393
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
and this plays out in lots of

394
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,120
organizations as a tension between the

395
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,639
the business units who are trying to go

396
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,240
faster get more customers do things

397
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
differently and the central it who's

398
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
trying to control consumption and

399
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
basically reduce the variation

400
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
so this this traditional framing with

401
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,079
the wall of confusion between us sort of

402
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
sets these two forces against each other

403
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,920
um but now we're adding another

404
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,680
consideration right so if we're going to

405
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,199
consider security then we have in a lot

406
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,839
of cases a lot of organizations added a

407
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,240
new a new wall of confusion right so you

408
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
have these traditional forces developers

409
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
don't necessarily understand security

410
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,959
security doesn't understand operations

411
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,440
uh there's in in some organizations if

412
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,800
you get deep enough down this rabbit

413
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
hole you start to realize um the

414
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
security and the compliance people don't

415
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,880
necessarily see eye to eye on some of

416
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,079
this either so this is an

417
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,079
oversimplification but for the sake of

418
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,920
the argument um i we're gonna we're

419
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
gonna go with it

420
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,120
so these walls are there because we

421
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,839
don't understand the other games that

422
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,160
these these other these are people we're

423
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
all people um and we don't understand

424
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
that they're connected together that

425
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,160
there's there's really like one

426
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,000
organizational game there's one

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
collective uh that we that we're serving

428
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,399
so is there a way to win all of these

429
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,320
games together

430
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
uh there's a new way and i'm gonna start

431
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
with this academic framing hopefully get

432
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,320
more and more concrete and and hopefully

433
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,399
more and more relevant so this new game

434
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
and this is this is from james language

435
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,199
um is this this scope economy so it acts

436
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,360
a bit like a clutch or kind of like a

437
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,600
fulcrum that balances the

438
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
differentiation in the scale economy to

439
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
enable innovation and efficiency and

440
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
security

441
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,079
and the scope economy

442
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,560
in the in the best cases of this results

443
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
from these ongoing negotiations

444
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,680
recognizing the selfish interests in

445
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,399
favor of the collective interests

446
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,440
so

447
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
getting more and more concrete you have

448
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
if you've optimized everything for

449
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,760
innovation and you allow every single

450
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,560
team to make all the choices they want

451
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
you end up with a lot of different

452
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
different um and varied ways to do

453
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,040
pipelines to do you know the object mall

454
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,759
to do the databases to do whatever and

455
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,320
that that is great for the innovation

456
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,399
but you've created all this downstream

457
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,560
operational burden for the organization

458
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,199
and you've created this like very broad

459
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,839
and widening uh attack surface from a

460
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,399
security perspective so it might be more

461
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,360
valuable to look at those patterns that

462
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
were innovative and look at the

463
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,399
commonalities that might be reused

464
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,720
across the organization and bring those

465
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,959
into this central platform

466
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,880
to be reused by everyone and then

467
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,199
conversely you also see this in

468
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,120
especially in in heavily regulated

469
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,160
organizations where the resources are

470
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,800
overly restricted and as a consequence

471
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,560
of that restriction you're not really

472
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
getting innovation and so figuring out

473
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
kind of based on the risk and and the

474
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
the you know the policies that you can

475
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,519
enforce with the platform it might be

476
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,720
more valuable to pre-audit and secure

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
some of these libraries some of these

478
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
services and bring those into the shared

479
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
platform to be access and and be more

480
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,920
valuable so

481
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
i'm going to argue i'm going to assert

482
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
every cloud native company it builds

483
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,000
these platforms

484
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,759
has built these platforms is building

485
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,079
and extending these platforms because

486
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,600
they have to

487
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
you can't you can't get to the scale and

488
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,519
keep the promises that you need to keep

489
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,120
um if you're doing everything with this

490
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,839
artisanal you know hand hand

491
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
automation and security approach so this

492
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
is from the sre book this is the google

493
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,199
way

494
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,319
i'm not going to read the whole thing

495
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
but i'm just going to read this this

496
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
bottom part so development teams can

497
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
focus on the business logic because the

498
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,720
framework already takes care of correct

499
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
infrastructure use

500
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,720
this is google explaining uh in in some

501
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,760
degree how they built their shared

502
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,799
platform that's straight from the sr

503
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
ebook borg is a scope economy construct

504
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,880
kubernetes is a scope economy construct

505
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,760
yay

506
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,199
uh i also think it's interesting to

507
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
think about kubernetes is an open source

508
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
global commons to build a local shared

509
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,120
platform commons and then establishing

510
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,840
an slo is a calming exercise between

511
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
sres and software engineers so what is

512
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,520
the equivalent negotiation for

513
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,120
securability

514
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
what is securability what are the

515
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
principles of securability i'm not sure

516
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,039
either right i never said i know a

517
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,679
security even is it's never been my job

518
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,520
um but i i do know a thing about

519
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
reliability and this is one of my

520
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,039
favorite characters in that narrative uh

521
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,520
shout out to joe armstrong rest in peace

522
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
and erlang and this is the six laws of

523
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,000
reliability and i'm not saying this is

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
the rel the laws of secure ability but

525
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,840
it's not a bad place to start um

526
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,039
isolation

527
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,039
concurrency failure detection fall

528
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,320
determination

529
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
live code upgrade

530
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and stable storage uh go look into some

531
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,679
of his work and some of his talks on

532
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
these topics um and then this is me

533
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
being silly on twitter any sufficiently

534
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,440
complicated microservice deployment

535
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
contains an ad hoc informally specified

536
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
but in the implementation of half of

537
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,919
earling i'll stand behind that and

538
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,919
again this is my advice to you good

539
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,960
devops copy great devops steal

540
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
whatever whatever you want to call

541
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
yourselves but

542
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
going back to the to the stealing idea

543
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
this is this is the chapters from the

544
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,320
sre book that i recommend everyone read

545
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
no matter what your job is

546
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
security operations development whatever

547
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,559
embracing risk limiting toil most of

548
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,160
those ideas would translate into any

549
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,799
domain and be a collective concern

550
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
and then what would it mean to have a

551
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
security level objective and how would

552
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,240
you measure that and i'm not sure i have

553
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
the answers but i i really like thinking

554
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
about this and and measuring this and

555
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
being in a position to to help

556
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,120
organizations make progress so this is

557
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,799
the the same exact quote the only thing

558
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,960
i really changed here was the word

559
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
security so just to kind of read the

560
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,640
same thing again

561
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
development teams can focus on the

562
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,919
business logic because the framework

563
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,200
already takes care of security

564
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
considerations that's the holy grail to

565
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
me so this platform that we're building

566
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
whatever it is for your organization

567
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,160
has to continuously and automatically

568
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,559
audit and enforce policy because the old

569
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
style of security and inspection and

570
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,039
theatrics cannot keep up um with this

571
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,360
micro service world we're moving into so

572
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,440
how's that platform get implemented well

573
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
it's this notion of commenting and

574
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
bringing all these selfish interests

575
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,919
that we all have into that platform into

576
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
that manifestation of our organizational

577
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,559
needs risks need for innovation need for

578
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,880
efficiency and building the right thing

579
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,640
if you get too far in one direction you

580
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,080
get out of balance it doesn't really

581
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
work right so if developers are running

582
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,559
everything then you're creating a lot of

583
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,559
operational burden if operators are

584
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,080
stopping everything or security stopping

585
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
everything you're not really innovating

586
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,840
so finding that balancing point by

587
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
getting those selfish interests to

588
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
negotiate with each other in favor of

589
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,400
the collective interest so this is the

590
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,559
holy grail we want to get to developers

591
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
can do everything to create novelty to

592
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
create innovation you have this platform

593
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
in the middle that keeps all these

594
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,039
promises

595
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
provide self-service access with the

596
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
enabling constraints and underlying that

597
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,840
you have this

598
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,600
securable and reliable compute

599
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,840
networking and storage infrastructure

600
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,640
so

601
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
that's simple it's not always easy

602
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,880
believe me i know and i'm sure some of

603
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
you know when you hear this all the time

604
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
you know the culture is the hard thing

605
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
but but it's it's yeah it's hard so

606
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,240
security is also never done that's

607
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
another thing this is an ongoing

608
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
negotiation um sometimes i hear people

609
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
say this i i frequently hear people say

610
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,120
this um which is like

611
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
good luck good luck with that

612
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,600
so just keep in mind resistance to

613
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
change might be the only thing more

614
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,679
inevitable than change

615
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,640
and

616
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
there's this there's this dynamic you

617
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,760
know where we don't want to forget how

618
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,280
we do things here

619
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
that's what we are this is how we do

620
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,000
things

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,679
um and going back to this that i

622
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,840
introduced you to earlier my advice to

623
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,080
you is

624
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
to seek advantage

625
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
always be seeking

626
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,799
the advantage so

627
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,080
coming to the end

628
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
conclusion this is not a technical

629
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
problem

630
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
this security is not a people problem

631
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,000
security is a socio-technical system and

632
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
you have to solve both of these together

633
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,480
i don't have time to learn new things

634
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,640
because i'm too busy getting things done

635
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
that's a very famous quote by the least

636
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
productive person in the world

637
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
and with that thank you i'm not here to

638
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,799
answer questions i'm here to have

639
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,799
conversations
