00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,600
s-bomb

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,640
the rest of the story

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,519
introducing our three explorers

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,320
alan friedman is a paladin a warrior who

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,639
swore an oath to protect and help

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,400
everyone else protect themselves and

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,279
others

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,760
he isn't actually good with weapons but

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
has studied many in arcane tool and art

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
a noted scholar before taking the

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,119
paladin oath six years ago he recently

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,560
sojourned from ntia to sissa he works

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479
with communities and trades across the

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,640
realm to help build shared scalable

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
defenses well not scalable like a ball

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,079
because that would be bad

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,600
while he certainly didn't discover the

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
book of s-bomb he has spent far too much

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
time talking about it

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
nisha kumar

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,039
nisha is a barbarian a fierce warrior

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
that rushes in to defend open source

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,920
from the dangers of clutter and toil she

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
is most effective with the snake staff

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,239
but is also pretty good with the gopher

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,559
club nisha belongs to the open source

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,000
technology center tribe at vmware

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,280
and emily fox emily is a former paladin

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
turned rogue known for her stealth and

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
getting software engineers to develop

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
more securely without their knowledge

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
she lurks in cloud services at the fruit

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
company providing precision in security

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,280
architecture design while also

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
co-leading the security technical

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,439
advisory guild in the cncf she

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,520
repeatedly demonstrates resourcefulness

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
cunning and versatility making her

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
skills and those of nisha and alan

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
essential to any successful s-bomb

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
adventuring party

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,159
our story begins

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
in a world of compliance requirements

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,520
security compromises and ridiculously

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
long dependency chains

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
three unlikely travelers cross paths to

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,040
clear the smoke and mirrors around

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,399
s-bomb the rest of the story

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,200
our champions of security compliance and

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,880
open source nisha alan and emily have

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,639
arrived at a local pub to catch up

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,399
they talk about the latest supply chain

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,120
attacks the residual effects of solar

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,319
winds how everyone is seeing an increase

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,920
in attacks

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
eventually their conversation

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,640
transitions to the most recent u.s

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,440
executive order on cyber security and

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
the multiple efforts cropping up across

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,959
the world to implement the software bill

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,720
of materials

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,360
as they talk a stranger approaches

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
our travelers break off their

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,959
conversation as the stranger stares

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,959
intently

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,640
weirdly

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,200
their face appears to be worn by

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
countless hours of

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,519
excel use

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
the stranger whispers

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,400
that which you seek

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,200
can only be found

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,239
over there

74
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,440
the stranger extends a long crooked

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,480
finger

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,360
to indicate a shelf in the corner our

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
travelers don't recall being there the

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,920
last time they visited

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,120
the stranger coughs

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,000
and turns back to our intrepid trio

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,760
they warn

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,120
you may never use it

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
but when you need it

84
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,840
it is

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
valuable

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
alan jumps up off of the stool and walks

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,319
over to the shelf

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,560
grabs a heavy

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
large

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,920
book

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
closely resembling the complete rainbow

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
series in size

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
and holds it up

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,959
emily

95
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
looks at nisha

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,439
who shrugs as the stranger fades from

97
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,439
view

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
so alan what on earth do you have there

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
why this is s-bomb nisha and i have been

100
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,560
chasing down the mysteries of this for

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,159
quite some time now

102
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
indeed i feel like we spent the last

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,199
year chasing and talking about this

104
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,839
artifact what's another session to set

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,320
everyone straight on the actual spawn

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
story

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
alan drops the s-bomb in the middle of

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,600
the table

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
our companions settle in to begin

110
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,880
planning their journey

111
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,160
two strangers sit listening intently

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
so i recall alan and i talking about

113
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,240
this a long time ago back before

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
solarwinds consumed any sense of supply

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
chain innocence how do we expect folks

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
to use it should we just throw it at

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,880
people like a confusion spell because

118
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
ultimately that's what it's bound to

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
cause what kinds of information are in

120
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
this thing

121
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
i don't recommend throwing it at people

122
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
we want it to be useful not confusing

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
and it really depends on the s-bomb

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,680
there are a lot more metadata that could

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
be included beyond the minimum

126
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
requirements

127
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
some can provide information about the

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
source code the build environment and

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,720
the actors who attest it to the process

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
that makes sense i mean security folks

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
scare enough people as it is anytime we

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
can help others produce actionable

133
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
security relevant information that is

134
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440
easy is a win in my book but what about

135
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,759
formats is one better than the other i

136
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,199
keep hearing that there's a lot of them

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,039
out there

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,919
true standards both are likened dignity

139
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,520
in fair software where we lay our scene

140
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,919
alan no wrong book

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,639
oh sorry i got a little confused in

142
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
costume so basically there are two

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,680
primary formats that are reasonably

144
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
widely deployed today uh cyclone dx

145
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
which comes up the oauth world uh it's a

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
a

147
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
fancy project there and spdx which is a

148
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
linux foundation project that just got

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
iso status both are great both have

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
active development communities um and

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,880
the important thing here is that

152
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
a standard format

153
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
enables you to create a broader tooling

154
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,560
ecosystem so what we're interested in

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
doing is saying what's the metadata that

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
we're tracking let's have a common way

157
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,319
of tracking it with clearly labeled

158
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,360
fields

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
and so we can use the minimum sets to

160
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,680
convey and move the data around

161
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
so it sounds like if someone is already

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
using one format over another there's no

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,960
reason to change it

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
but what if i'm not producing s-bombs or

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
and i'm not using a specific format i

166
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,960
don't want to upend my entire tool chain

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
and tech stack and tech technology

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
ecosystem just to be able to produce

169
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,759
this thing that somewhere somewhere on

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
the internet or in the world is probably

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,520
going to use

172
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
might look at but then not know what to

173
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
do with

174
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,880
as alan said the specific format is not

175
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,560
important but the metadata within it is

176
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,440
regardless of what format you choose it

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
becomes useless if the metadata is not

178
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,560
there

179
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,599
if you are not already producing s bonds

180
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
look for tooling that complements your

181
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,319
existing tool chain there are many open

182
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,639
source tools created and maintained by

183
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
volunteers in the community and in

184
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
industry working together to make the

185
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,479
state of the art better this is how open

186
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,039
source works

187
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,240
yes so the success of standards is

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
openness uh and the vision here is that

189
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,479
we should have a shared understanding of

190
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,800
what we have and then building on top of

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
that data layer as an industry so

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,039
we have a great open source community

193
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
and open source tools and that's great

194
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,199
there's some people trying to make money

195
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
by building tools and hopefully they're

196
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,400
interesting enough people say hey yeah

197
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
i'll pay for that and that's okay too

198
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,599
the important thing is that we have a

199
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
shared vision about the value of this

200
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
data layer and that we're building on

201
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
top of that

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,840
so it's not the portion of invincibility

203
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
that i keep hearing about and it's going

204
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,039
to solve all of our problems in cyber

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,000
security and cloud native right

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
um i don't know too many people that

207
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
have actually been saying that i think

208
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
that's something that people sort of as

209
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,560
a straw man

210
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,280
try to poke at but reality it's it's

211
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
just a data layer and we think it's a

212
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
foundational data layer so imagine it's

213
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
something to akin to

214
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,639
cve right there's nothing magical about

215
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
giving a vulnerability a data string uh

216
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,240
or a number string that doesn't help you

217
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,200
but

218
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,279
once we have this shared vision where we

219
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,880
can communicate about say a

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
vulnerability or about the components

221
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,559
that we're using then we can work

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
together and then we can build more

223
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
tools and find more use cases on top of

224
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
that

225
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,880
having navigated past the misconceptions

226
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,920
in the pub

227
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,040
our travelers embark on their quest

228
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,120
so this book has a lot of information in

229
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
it that's great

230
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
what can we do with this information

231
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
how do you all see this meeting and

232
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
s-bomb consumers needs what use cases

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,560
exist for the content in an s-bomb that

234
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
metadata that nisha and alan have both

235
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
referred to

236
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,640
so an s-bomb is an important part of the

237
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
balanced supply chain breakfast it's the

238
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,959
beans in your english your full english

239
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,399
it's the chocolate sprinkles on your

240
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,160
dutch roll it's the muesli in your

241
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
morning routine it's

242
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,279
apparently alan skipped breakfast today

243
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,760
but i'll go with that analogy

244
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,399
s balm is like a key nutrient that if

245
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
you were deficient in

246
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,040
manifests itself as symptoms that seem

247
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
unrelated

248
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
once you have an inventory of your

249
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
deployed software you can do things like

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,440
correlate what you have deployed with

251
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
what

252
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
vulnerabilities exist

253
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,120
or if you potentially have software

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
whose license doesn't match your

255
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,760
organization policy

256
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,839
excellent so it can help organizations

257
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,920
not only make but automate compliance

258
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,640
and security decisions before deployment

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,600
and after deploy that's fantastic

260
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
what's important is that it won't convey

261
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,519
vulnerabilities but certainly provides

262
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,160
you with a map about what you've got to

263
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
match against what is vulnerable this

264
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
sounds like it really was designed for

265
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
on-premise environments actually the

266
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,560
impetus was for on-prem in the midst of

267
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
time when software used to live in place

268
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
rather than in the ether the value was

269
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
really uh that defenders needed to know

270
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,240
was on their network and you can't

271
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
defend what you don't know about uh and

272
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,760
in fact a lot of the early adopters uh

273
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,519
that care about this are in critical

274
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,839
infrastructure dealing with on-prem

275
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,320
software things like medical devices in

276
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
energy industrial control system world

277
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,160
um but the spirit of needing to know

278
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
what we're dealing with what we're

279
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,920
trying to defend that lives on with the

280
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,120
cloud native security warriors today

281
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,040
honestly that's a great point between

282
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,880
on-prem and cloud native with more

283
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
organizations either moving to acquiring

284
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
or being born on cloud companies are

285
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,519
constantly evaluating their current

286
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
product space i can see the s-bomb

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
helping here

288
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,839
yes

289
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
companies are making acquisitions

290
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
consolidating and driving digital

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
transformation

292
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
having an s bomb would help consolidate

293
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
in key areas and reduce

294
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,519
variety of versions of one software

295
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
component

296
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,040
organized deployments and so much more

297
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
essentially not having an spot was the

298
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
supply chain equivalent of forgetting

299
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,000
your 20-sided dice in d d or maybe

300
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,279
not bothering to comment your code

301
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,000
as nisha emily and alan continue on

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
their journey the beast of secure builds

303
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
steps in front of them blocking their

304
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,920
path they must confront it before

305
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,079
proceeding

306
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,639
i've heard so many things about s-bomb

307
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,959
it seems everyone is assuming it can do

308
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
everything except be that portion of

309
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,040
invincibility

310
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
it that it can provide integrity over

311
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,200
the entire supply chain solve open

312
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
source security and auto report security

313
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,079
vulnerabilities for you that's ludicrous

314
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,200
right

315
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,920
so

316
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,120
in fact

317
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
s bomb doesn't do any of those things by

318
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
itself but

319
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,360
try doing any of those priorities that

320
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
we all should be working towards without

321
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,920
an s bomb it's painful we've all tried

322
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
to experience doing it and trying to

323
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
build our own or roll our own and it can

324
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
be very difficult and s bomb makes all

325
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,760
of those easier and more scalable

326
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,560
yep

327
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
you are responsible for your supply

328
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,760
chains integrity and s-pump can help you

329
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,399
establish the state of the items it

330
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,600
knows about

331
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,760
this doesn't imply integrity of the

332
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,959
software supply chain and signing an

333
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,240
s-bomb is not a minimum requirement if

334
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
an attacker were to successfully

335
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,320
compromise the publishing infrastructure

336
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
that produced the software and the

337
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
s-bomb and if all of that were signed

338
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,079
you'd simply just have an inventory of

339
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,800
everything in the software including any

340
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
libraries the attackers introduced in

341
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
the code base through the build

342
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,800
the s-bomb doesn't stop that

343
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
essentially though folks can generate it

344
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
from source build or post build with

345
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
binary analysis generating the s-bomb

346
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,519
from the build seems the right way to go

347
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
based on what nisha is saying

348
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,240
if you build it you better s-bomb i mean

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
we know that compilers are the dark arts

350
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,639
and build systems really can be as well

351
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
these days

352
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
ah this is why it's so important that in

353
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
addition to source code security folks

354
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
are paying attention to what goes into

355
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,279
their build workers disabling ssh access

356
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,920
and so much more the build system can be

357
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
compromised and impact what is in your

358
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
software and your s-bomb

359
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,360
that's why in the optimal case a secured

360
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
build process is what we need not just

361
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
for our software but for the s-bomb data

362
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
to track it especially in cloud native

363
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,760
as our vision is that we're agile and we

364
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,959
like to move fast and break things

365
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,040
having subdued the beast of secure

366
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
builds our travelers have approached the

367
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,680
swamp of sharing uncertainties

368
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,680
unclear on how to move forward

369
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
there are a bunch of minimums and

370
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,199
depending on your industry or regulatory

371
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,760
requirements these minimums may vary

372
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,199
right

373
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,560
so at its core an s-bomb is about

374
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,880
identifying a component and to do that

375
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
there's some basics that we need uh we

376
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
need to have some identifiers ideally

377
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,959
some identifiers that other people use

378
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,680
so you can map them between databases um

379
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,199
and then there's a bunch of other use

380
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,920
cases as well uh so

381
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
one popular way that people sort of say

382
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,279
this is we want to use s bombs to track

383
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,279
vulnerabilities and in fact

384
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
some of the data formats can track

385
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
vulnerability data in the s-bomb which

386
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
is very useful if you're a developer one

387
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,959
of the risks however is if you start

388
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,880
depending on the s-bomb

389
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
to track this data and it moves across

390
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,959
organizational boundaries then you're

391
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,480
not sure if it's live and so we have to

392
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
be very very careful about the

393
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
assumptions that we make about the state

394
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
of the data in the s-bomb and what we

395
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
can and can't depend on to be completely

396
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,959
up-to-date

397
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,000
so

398
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
basically

399
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,199
because we've got so many

400
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,040
vulnerabilities today and we want to

401
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,399
make sure that the information that's

402
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
available is complete accurate and

403
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
up-to-date because we've never ever

404
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
deployed any software anywhere in the

405
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
world that has remained secure for its

406
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,560
entire lifetime

407
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
yeah we can actually take a page out of

408
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,279
the manufacturing playbook where the

409
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,399
bill of materials is something that gets

410
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,040
passed on from supplier to supplier

411
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,519
until it finally ends up with the

412
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
product that gets shipped

413
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
and then there is a remediation process

414
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,079
where defects out in the field get

415
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,639
collected and sent back to the

416
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,399
to the suppliers and they use the s-bomb

417
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,959
to find out which component has the

418
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,519
defect so that they can fix that

419
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,160
component and the cycle repeats

420
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,399
so that makes a lot of sense and i'm

421
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,920
assuming that they have really good

422
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
established relationships they all trust

423
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,440
each other everything's good but

424
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,759
honestly that s-bomb is probably going

425
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,360
to come from a complete stranger all the

426
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,720
way on the other side of the world

427
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
somebody you've never met how can you

428
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,399
trust what's in it to be accurate and

429
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,639
what if it's incomplete what tools exist

430
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,519
to produce s-bombs and isn't producing

431
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,759
an accurate s bomb a challenge to begin

432
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,920
with and and don't even get me started

433
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,279
on consuming them that just seems like a

434
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,560
nightmare

435
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,639
so we've got a couple fun challenges

436
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,920
here you're right they're all things

437
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
that we need to tackle so one is hey

438
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
who's this coming from and of course uh

439
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,040
we have natural tools for that uh

440
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,600
signatures uh digital signatures but of

441
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
course um those of you who play in xml

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
and json know that rapper signatures are

443
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
non-trivial fortunately both spdx and

444
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,319
cyclone dx have been working on

445
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,919
developing those and they're great

446
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,559
projects like sig store to enable it

447
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
second challenge is saying well how do i

448
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,079
know the data is true and there are a

449
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,359
couple of things you can do one you can

450
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,439
count on the fact that it's illegal to

451
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,599
lie about a product two you can always

452
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,079
do the trust but verify uh you know when

453
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,480
you should talk to earlier about uh

454
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,919
source composition analysis tools and

455
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,000
binary analysis tools those may not be

456
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,760
the first best option but they're a

457
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,919
great way to validate some of this data

458
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,200
and then lastly we have the question

459
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
about how do we make sure that we can

460
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
consume this data and where we want to

461
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,480
head is supporting automated decisions

462
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,240
based on rules and there's a huge

463
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
development opportunity here uh we're

464
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,679
going to need smart people to think

465
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,720
about this

466
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,600
this is the whole growth area of

467
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,480
code is compliance and uh and policy is

468
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,679
code

469
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,880
what we want to do is sort of think

470
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
about customizable approaches that are

471
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
less complex and more straightforward

472
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
and to do that to make progress we need

473
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
to share what we have and work towards

474
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
common policies and decisions that are

475
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,799
useful to the s-bomb consumers

476
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,280
that's right alan making the s-bomb

477
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,840
actionable for policy makers in an

478
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
organization is an opportunity right for

479
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,400
the taking

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,679
a swamp monster emerges from an alcove

481
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,960
of algae and growth and announces loudly

482
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,000
ha

483
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,120
i already have that with my source code

484
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
analysis tools

485
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,400
nisha rolls a 19 to detect glamour and

486
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
the swamp monster fades to reveal a

487
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
small fly

488
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
aha dependency trackers like you see in

489
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
source code analysis tools typically

490
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
rely on a package manifest a package

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,760
manifest will give you some of the

492
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,840
information but not all of the

493
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,799
information what actually gets installed

494
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,000
is determined by say it with me now

495
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,120
the builds

496
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
so what about sharing s-bombs

497
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,640
ah

498
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
there be dragons as we've reached the

499
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,120
limits of our map um

500
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,200
we know that this is a priority and

501
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,240
there are a lot of folks that are

502
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,720
exploring how to do it um one of the

503
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,480
easiest ways that we can do it today is

504
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,600
there are companies that are already

505
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
saying hey i've got my live build i've

506
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
got my live s bomb and i just post it

507
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
online and that's great for a lot of

508
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,799
organizations however there are going to

509
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
be some folks that say you know what i'm

510
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
not ready to make this data public for

511
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,919
whatever reason

512
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,280
and so then we're going to need to think

513
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,960
about what access control can look like

514
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,840
or

515
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,400
you could publish your s-bombs through

516
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
customer portals or websites or even

517
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,280
shipping it along with your product very

518
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
much like how you would be able to ship

519
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,760
s-bombs with container images and store

520
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,120
them both in a container registry

521
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
and there are emerging technologies uh

522
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
like manufacture usage descriptor which

523
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
is a way of having a secure pointer to

524
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,360
an s-bom or the d-bomb model which is an

525
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
access control overlay that allows you

526
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,880
to sort of put a lot of supply chain

527
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
data

528
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,280
pretty much anywhere and then assign

529
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,120
read and write and edit access it so

530
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,559
that your customers and your upstream

531
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,640
providers can all talk about it and you

532
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,039
can control how they're doing it

533
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,799
right and that makes sense and what's

534
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,039
important really here is that it's only

535
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
good if it's relevant to the software

536
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,280
that's in use not two versions behind

537
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,039
and that's why it would be great to be

538
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,799
able to produce it as part of your build

539
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,320
because it can reliably match what

540
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,000
you're shipping or making public at the

541
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,039
time

542
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,760
so given that i'm a crafty clever fox

543
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
that i'm putting on my attacker hat how

544
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,480
do i explain that no attacker is going

545
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,400
to leverage the s-bomb as a shopping

546
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,640
list of places to exploit as this seems

547
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,159
like your really key area for doing

548
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,159
reconnaissance work so you know it's

549
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,240
2021 so we didn't just talk about

550
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,280
attackers or monsters uh we actually do

551
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
a little threat model

552
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,679
so

553
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,799
you're really powerful attackers uh they

554
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,480
don't need this right if they're going

555
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
after your software um you know jidra's

556
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,520
free they can do reverse engineering

557
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
they're not going to

558
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
they'll figure out what is in your

559
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
system and at the other end of the

560
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,640
spectrum you've got your automated

561
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,840
attackers right people who are just

562
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
doing spray and pray looking for a

563
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,200
toehold so they can start a ransomware

564
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,360
project or something like that um and

565
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
there again they don't need the roadmap

566
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,760
um

567
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
they're just doing automatic scanning

568
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,919
and if you have a flaw they'll find it

569
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,320
what we need is to give the defenders

570
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,720
the roadmap so they know what it is that

571
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
they should be paying attention to and

572
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,919
worrying about

573
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,720
that's right the s-bomb is a tool for

574
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,679
the defender not the attacker

575
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,320
if you were to give a map of your castle

576
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,320
to an attacker but have uh each entry

577
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,039
well defended the map is not going to be

578
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,240
of any use

579
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,880
that makes total sense and

580
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,919
like

581
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,360
it's part of a good defense and depth

582
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
strategy the s-bomb is not going to

583
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,919
defeat that all by itself realistically

584
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
even if they had that full shopping list

585
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,360
they're going to have to do a whole lot

586
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,559
more work

587
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
but what about sensitive information

588
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,400
such as sources and methods we can't

589
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
possibly share everything please tell me

590
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,080
no one's putting secrets in this stuff

591
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
no the s-bomb is not meant to store your

592
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
secrets

593
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,960
there isn't really a formal standardized

594
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,559
way of sharing sensitive information

595
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,720
spdx has this concept of profiles and

596
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,840
one of them is the usage profile which

597
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,960
gets shared between suppliers of

598
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,640
components and

599
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,360
consumers of those components and this

600
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
is something the auto industry is

601
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,440
championing

602
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
this could probably provide a template

603
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,720
for how other industries could share

604
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,159
information

605
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,000
i mean ultimately you want uniform

606
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,480
adoption across the board s-bom and

607
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,720
supply chain security is way bigger than

608
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
just cloud and cloud-native some

609
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,600
industries it sounds like are moving

610
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,440
really fast like automotive and finance

611
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,880
that's right as a cloud native community

612
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,919
we want this to be adopted beyond just

613
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,840
netflix and twitter

614
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,919
and for that to happen we need to be

615
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,600
really careful about how we

616
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,960
build and inventory our software supply

617
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
chain and we need to consider what kind

618
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,480
of checks and balances we need before we

619
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,760
deploy our sas offerings

620
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
a lot of people

621
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,919
in cloud native when they think about

622
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,279
sas they think twitter and we really

623
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,640
want to

624
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,080
move on to

625
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,039
we want this to move on to industries

626
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,320
that are uh more serious like uh

627
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,000
healthcare and

628
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,799
uh finance and uh

629
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,840
government uh systems

630
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,959
things that keep grandma

631
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,400
are you saying that there are people

632
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,480
involved in security that aren't on

633
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
twitter i'm pretty sure i would have

634
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,039
read about that on twitter

635
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,720
our travelers have navigated the swamp

636
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
of sharing uncertainties and are heading

637
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,000
back to the pub to share their story

638
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
but how that story continues is up to

639
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,679
you the community and industry to make

640
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,960
something of s-bombs to use them

641
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
the winds coming across the land blowing

642
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,840
from executive orduria hint that this

643
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,240
issue is not going away and will only

644
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
get more important

645
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,000
that's right the leaders of the realm in

646
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
the white castle or at least the white

647
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,760
house have decreed that s-bomb will be a

648
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,360
priority uh anyone who wants to sell

649
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,600
critical software to the government will

650
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
eventually have to have an s-bomb and i

651
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,039
have a hunch that companies aren't going

652
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,520
to want to have two different versions

653
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
and so we're going to see most

654
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,880
organizations realize that this is

655
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,039
something they're going to need to have

656
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,919
can we succeed on this quest

657
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,799
our party of adventurers have some solid

658
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,279
members and alan

659
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,039
hey

660
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,760
but we need more help how can folks get

661
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,039
involved

662
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
well uh one thing folks can do if they

663
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
want to sort of see the big picture on s

664
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
bomb is join this international

665
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,400
community-led effort uh that's brought

666
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,039
together experts from a range of sectors

667
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,200
and different types of technologies and

668
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,880
to do that uh

669
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
very excited it's an open effort uh and

670
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
so get in touch with me through email or

671
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,240
find me online

672
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
or you can join the amazing open source

673
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,840
projects out there both svdx and cyclone

674
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,880
