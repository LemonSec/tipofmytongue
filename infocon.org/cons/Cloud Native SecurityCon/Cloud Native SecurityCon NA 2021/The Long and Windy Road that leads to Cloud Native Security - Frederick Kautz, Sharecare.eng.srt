1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,159
okay so

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,080
um this is going to be

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,319
less on the technical side

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,919
though if anyone wants to cover some of

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,760
the technical stuff please hit me up

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,360
afterwards i'm more than happy to jump

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,799
in

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,599
and what we're going to cover

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,720
is

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,520
how to engage so a

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
your infosec team as an engineer as a

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
developer how do we really engage them

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,199
and help move the organization towards a

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,439
towards a zero trust environment and the

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
reason why i'm focusing on you as

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
engineers is that i think the

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,559
source of a zero trust strategy

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,280
has to have a very strong component of

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,440
application developers being part of

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
that like it's not something that you

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,640
can just say oh i'm gonna go buy a

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,280
product we're zero trust now or

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
we're gonna create some definitions in

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
infosec and configure some firewall

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,640
rules and our zero trust so this is

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
something that really requires a

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,320
fundamental shift in some of the

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
controls that exist

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
within the application or that the

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,559
application itself is designed so that

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,560
it can make use of some of those some of

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760
those controls

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,720
and

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,520
in order to properly engage with infosec

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
it also helps to understand who they are

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
where they come from why they why they

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
do the things that they do

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,960
they're

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,759
we we don't want to treat them as like

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,360
yours brick wall we have to scale but

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
instead as a

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
valuable partners that help us get to

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
where we want to go

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,799
so

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,799
a very brief intro

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,159
whenever you talk with someone who's in

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,720
security or infosec you will often see

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,840
this triangle it's the cia triad which

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,720
covers confidentiality integrity and

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
availability

51
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,439
and so

52
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,880
what they mean by

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
by these three things is that you can

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,799
take pretty much any security control

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,200
and try to map it to one or more of

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,799
these

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,399
interestingly availability is often

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,920
ignored people often focus on the

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
confidentiality and integrity but the

60
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,000
fact that your system has to stay online

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that has to meet its slas

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
is uh

63
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,399
is a critical component of that

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,840
availability as well

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,680
so

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
if you look at what infosec is really

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
trying to do

68
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
they're not trying to tell you no what

69
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
they're trying to do is trying to

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
identify what risks are there they're

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
trying to work out how to inform you of

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
what the risks are for inform the

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,959
executive leadership executive

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,040
leadership has to then take those risks

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
and then make a determination based upon

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,599
what what the outcomes are going to be

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,840
and what those risks are as to whether

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
they're going to accept the risk or

79
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,319
if they're not going to accept the risk

80
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
then what can they do to mitigate the

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
risk uh mitigate as in like we're going

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
to stick a firewall in front of it or

83
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,000
we're going to stick a policy engine in

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
front of it or how do you transfer the

85
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
risk

86
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
for transferring the risk i'm uh is an

87
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,959
important aspect but that's something we

88
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,000
want that

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,519
is probably not our first line of

90
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
defense that we want to head towards a

91
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
really good example of transfer of risk

92
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
that we're seeing today though is

93
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,120
you're seeing cyber security insurance

94
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
so if someone gets ransomware then they

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
can say hey we're going to bring in this

96
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,360
particular thing to help with that

97
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,159
but

98
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,239
generally that's like

99
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,879
worst case scenario and another example

100
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,319
of that from a personal perspective is

101
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,159
like if you're driving a car

102
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,400
you can transfer some of the financial

103
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,799
liability to an insurance company so

104
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,319
transfer of risk

105
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,000
final one is avoidance which is like you

106
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
know what this is too dangerous or we

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
don't want to accept the risk value's

108
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
not there so you just

109
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
eliminate the uh

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
the thing that was bringing in the risk

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
in the first place so it'd be like let's

112
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
go and remove the data and go purge it

113
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,080
or destroy the medium or so on and now

114
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
it's not a risk

115
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
and so

116
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
they also like to establish

117
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
policy standards procedures and

118
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
guidelines

119
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,319
what we mean by this is

120
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,000
policy is

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,959
i

122
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
all data at rest must be encrypted

123
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,519
proceed

124
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,840
standards would be we use aes uh

125
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
procedures would be something like

126
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
we

127
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
use bitlocker in this specific way to

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,040
implement aes to have value encryption

129
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
and then guidelines are things that are

130
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
good advice to follow but you don't

131
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,358
necessarily have to follow them but

132
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,720
there may be implications if you do but

133
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
it's not like strictly required

134
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
so

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,520
in terms of the other thing that you

136
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
often see as well is response to

137
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,600
security incidents and breaches

138
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,440
so as in like something happens there

139
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,800
are the teams who they have teams there

140
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,360
who go and do the forensics and so on um

141
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
one word of advice though as well since

142
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
is if you try to avoid the word breach

143
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
and the reason you want to avoid this

144
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
word this specific word

145
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
is because there's only

146
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,440
a small number of people in the in any

147
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,199
organization who is able to say that

148
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,400
something is a breach because there are

149
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
serious

150
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,759
legal ramifications that come with that

151
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
word so always start with the word

152
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
incident avoid the word breach until

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,199
someone from the pro from the

154
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,960
appropriate group has said this is a

155
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
this is a breach and then from that

156
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
moment on you would then use that

157
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
particular term but whenever you engage

158
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
with them or you're engaging with a

159
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
colleague like always use the word like

160
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
we've had an incident you know i think

161
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
this is serious or something you can say

162
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
like what's what's what's happening but

163
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,919
uh but stay away from that specific word

164
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,960
because there's serious legal

165
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
implications so just as a heads up

166
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,880
um

167
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,280
and so but all of this comes down to two

168
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
things

169
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
do care and and due diligence and do

170
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
care is like you're doing the right

171
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,759
thing

172
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,680
due diligence is how can we show that

173
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
we've done the right thing or what are

174
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
the actions we're doing to ensure we're

175
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,039
doing those things so

176
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,080
the every major infosec group has to

177
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
show that they're following ducare and

178
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,600
that they're following due diligence an

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
easy heuristic to this is

180
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
what would a person who is trained in

181
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
this who is an expert in this do what

182
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,320
would a reasonable set of actions be

183
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,160
if you if you can consider those to be

184
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,759
reasonable then you're probably

185
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,600
following due care

186
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
and this also becomes very important

187
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
because when you start looking at

188
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
massive organizations this do care if

189
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
you're not following do care then there

190
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,000
may be major implications that go to the

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
actual person themselves who is supposed

192
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
to have that due care

193
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
so

194
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
um

195
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
so let's jump a little bit forward now

196
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,919
so we've gone over some of the basics

197
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,080
for for infosec describes like

198
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,919
how they think like why why they do

199
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,280
things that they do

200
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,319
um

201
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,479
one of the things that we're moving away

202
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
from is this concept of perimeter

203
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
defense so this is like your standard

204
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
network that you tend to see there's so

205
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,759
many variations of this one of the

206
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,520
variations is

207
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,680
kubernetes is actually

208
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,199
historically uh started off as a

209
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,639
perimeter defense style approach you

210
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
have your pod network pods can talk to

211
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
pods pods can talk to nodes nodes can

212
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,560
talk to nodes so

213
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
very very perimeter defense-like you had

214
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
ingress controllers and so on and

215
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,759
eventually you started to put more

216
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
policy which helped drive it down

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,199
but

218
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,720
like this this is a pattern that you see

219
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
over and over and over again

220
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,039
where we want to move

221
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
is towards this nebulous thing called

222
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,960
zero trust where you have controls that

223
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,599
are more granular closer to the

224
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,800
workloads

225
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,599
you have this untrusted network

226
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,240
that you're no longer basing your

227
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,319
your system on and you have this

228
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,440
attacker

229
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,759
that's on the far end so if they get in

230
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,960
just because they're on the network does

231
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
not mean that they have access to the

232
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,720
rest of the system so in a nutshell this

233
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
is sort of the view that we want to to

234
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,639
approach for hitting that zero trust

235
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,720
approach

236
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
but interestingly if you go to a company

237
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
and you say we need zero trust

238
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,400
one of the problems that we're running

239
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,160
into is that every vendor has a

240
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
different set of of what xero trust is

241
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
that we actually

242
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,440
we actually have a lot of issues on on

243
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,879
this particular path as a whole industry

244
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,120
because the term is diluted it's it's

245
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
been hyped up it's everyone's selling

246
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
you a zero trust thing things that were

247
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
invented 15 years ago are being pitched

248
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,400
to zero trust

249
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
um it's like it's it's really hard to

250
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
make sense of it so

251
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
the very first thing that you need to do

252
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,520
if you're migrating a company of of

253
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
sufficient size is you actually have to

254
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,879
define for yourself well when we say

255
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,680
zero trust this is what we mean

256
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,639
so you need a framework

257
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,360
so

258
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
one framework that i've been working

259
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,879
with some colleagues on

260
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,400
is this concept

261
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
of like the same way we have the cia

262
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,039
triad

263
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,800
we have this concept

264
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
of zero trust where we have identity

265
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,799
policy and control

266
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,719
and when you establish this this

267
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,919
actually gives you something like we're

268
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,679
bringing in a product where does it fit

269
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
does it give us identity does it make

270
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,959
our identity story better does it allow

271
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
us to manage a scale or is it a policy

272
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
thing like are we able to to drive and

273
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
control things and uh create rules

274
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
around it in order to control it is from

275
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
the control side is this something

276
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,839
that's automatable is it observable is

277
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
it something that i can

278
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
that i can manage at scale

279
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,640
so

280
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
we have so we have this framework

281
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
and diving a little bit into it a little

282
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,600
bit further so we have identity

283
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
and when we say identity the area that i

284
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
have been trying to push companies

285
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
towards is this concept of cryptographic

286
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
identity so if you think about how your

287
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
identity is done today in a lot of

288
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
organizations

289
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
ip address import your all your firewall

290
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
rules like you start looking at them

291
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
they're like i ip address support you

292
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,279
maybe dns helps break this little bit

293
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,279
but it still ends up boiling down to my

294
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,680
api to support so if we can land the

295
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
cryptographic identity

296
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,959
one of the ones that i'm involved with

297
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,399
is spiffy so

298
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,320
if you like i hope that it ends up being

299
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
something like spiffy but it doesn't

300
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
have to be spiffy the the fundamental

301
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
thing is the is the principle you get a

302
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,519
cryptographic identity

303
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
then you have something there that you

304
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,959
can that you can control

305
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,519
that it's ephemeral so that identity

306
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,519
eventually goes away after some period

307
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,600
of time so ideally you want to keep

308
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
those short in spiffy's case the

309
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,160
expiration time is an hour so you

310
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
actually issue an x59 certificate

311
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
instead of it lasting for a year you

312
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
have to renew it in 30 minutes to an

313
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,560
hour

314
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
which gives us the ability to constantly

315
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
validate the workloads

316
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,839
so in other words we can check does this

317
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
thing still meet our requirements based

318
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
upon what patch said it is is it running

319
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
the software that it should is it

320
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,279
configured in the way that we want it

321
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
configured is it attached to a system

322
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
that has the right set of tpms

323
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,519
uh maybe it's gone out of compliance and

324
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,880
then you can notice you don't

325
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
necessarily have to kill it but you

326
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
could you could look at the workload and

327
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,519
say

328
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,040
well let's go ahead and flag it and

329
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
let's make sure that that that we're

330
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
able to properly audit and get the right

331
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
people who own that in order to

332
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,320
go patch the system or or go fix it

333
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,360
we

334
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,920
that also gives us the ability to have

335
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,600
systems communicate with each other

336
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
using something like mutual tls where

337
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,480
you can think of mutual tls like

338
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
you in the same way like when you go to

339
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,760
like google.com or your bank.com you're

340
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,839
able to validate the server

341
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,279
as the client

342
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,440
visual tls allows you as a workload to

343
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,279
do the opposite as the server i can

344
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,680
validate the client the i can validate

345
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,480
the identity right off of the transport

346
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,079
so this means i don't even have to bring

347
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,360
secrets i don't have to have their

348
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,120
tokens or jots we want to make that

349
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,279
initial connection out to the system

350
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,040
that in both directions they can

351
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,640
validate each other so the x-519

352
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
certificate becomes part of that chain

353
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
of who you are

354
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
and allows you to identify yourself to

355
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
others in a in a uniform way

356
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
you also have to pay attention to user

357
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,079
identity i'm not diving into user

358
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,600
identity in this scenario but it's also

359
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,519
very important that you consider

360
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,519
what are your user identities doing

361
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,040
generally we want to stick with

362
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,760
standards something like jots or or

363
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,360
similar

364
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,639
that'll play well into into policy

365
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,079
so then you want to establish something

366
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
around policy and generally you want to

367
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
have policy consume your identity

368
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
so

369
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,600
the

370
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
with policy if you if you make them

371
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
declarative so there's a few uh engines

372
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
that exist in cncf but there's others as

373
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
well throughout the entire community

374
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,399
so

375
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
if you if you're able to say i want this

376
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
family of certificates or identities

377
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,399
that are cryptographically secure and

378
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
you're able to add that into your policy

379
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,160
so you can say the front-end server of

380
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,839
this application is able to connect to

381
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,839
the back-end server or backend database

382
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
of this particular system you can model

383
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,480
that

384
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
which means that if something else is

385
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
trying to connect to those systems it

386
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,079
violates your policy and that gets you

387
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
fast feedback on your observability

388
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
platform that something went wrong

389
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
this is actually key because if you look

390
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,279
at many previous attacks they managed to

391
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,800
break in through the front door through

392
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
jakarta struts

393
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
on an unpatched system or

394
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
or some other similar technology and

395
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
then once they managed to get to capture

396
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
that system and then

397
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
they end up extracting out information

398
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,079
from from the perimeter but if you have

399
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,560
this policy in place it says system a is

400
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
allowed to talk to system b and is

401
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,360
allowed to send these type of messages

402
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
because it is that if it's playing that

403
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,399
role

404
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,240
then this scopes down the types of

405
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
attacks and the attacker does not

406
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
necessarily know what policy you are

407
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
running on the other side or what are

408
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,839
valid messages you can send so this

409
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
actually ends up increasing the risk to

410
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
the attacker and simultaneously reduces

411
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
the value to the attacker that's really

412
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,680
important whenever you look at a

413
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,519
security control you always want to

414
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,360
consider how does this increase the risk

415
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
to the attacker and how does it decrease

416
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,120
the value to the attacker like that it

417
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,440
is like pure economics to them

418
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
and this this also plays all the way up

419
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
to advanced persistent threats because

420
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
even abts

421
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,079
they even they have limited resources

422
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,279
they still have to make decisions on

423
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,800
where they're going to attack and if you

424
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,160
look like you're well defended and

425
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,279
you're not going to get much value out

426
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,639
of it they'll actually go find softer

427
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,959
targets

428
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,519
in terms so we also want to have

429
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,600
policies over time we want to make them

430
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
human readable so people can audit them

431
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
and and create them and we want them to

432
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,440
be machine readable so that the machine

433
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,680
can can implement them

434
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
a really good heuristic is you look at

435
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,079
how git ops works imagine having a

436
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,760
github system that allows you to control

437
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
and and manage your policy through that

438
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
so you have a place you can commit your

439
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,000
your code your your policy you're able

440
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,839
to get that policy

441
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,880
reviewed

442
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
that goes to the right stakeholders in

443
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,519
the same way like you would with a code

444
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,800
pr you know i was like oh i have

445
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,920
something checked into something that

446
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
touches the database so i'll get the

447
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
database advent to look at it i have

448
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,399
something that is going to touch this

449
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,079
particular area let's make sure that i

450
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,399
bring in the right set of owners for

451
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,279
that

452
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,839
from the various groups

453
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,399
and

454
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,440
and that gives us a path towards uh

455
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,600
also maintaining that policy over time

456
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,760
it becomes something that is visible to

457
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
the people who needs to

458
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,120
um and those

459
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
we can actually tie that that identity

460
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,399
as i mentioned

461
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
to the mutual tls transfer credentials

462
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,160
so we actually look at the transfer

463
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
credentials you're not saying i am this

464
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
you're relying on your cryptographic

465
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,720
certificate to prove who you are

466
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
then control

467
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,360
all of this doesn't matter if you have

468
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,199
no way to control it so this is where

469
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
you want to start looking at things like

470
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
how do i how do i build automation

471
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,279
around it how do i add observability to

472
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
it uh how do i control this like if

473
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,279
you're controlling a single cluster

474
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,800
you can install things like istio linker

475
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
d you'll be in good shape if you want to

476
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,839
control a large number of clusters many

477
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,360
of them run by different teams and start

478
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
get a more uniform approach then we

479
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,880
really need to start thinking a lot

480
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
bigger about how these interactions

481
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
occur so it's more like an intro versus

482
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,399
inter

483
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,760
approach

484
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,639
there's also issues around how do you

485
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
how do you log

486
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,839
where do you keep your metrics ensure

487
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,079
that your sla so all these are important

488
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,680
if you don't have good control over your

489
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,839
system you're you're not going to

490
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,240
achieve your your goals so again

491
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,120
framework identity policy and control

492
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,920
so

493
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
now that we have a zero trust definition

494
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,480
time check how much time do i have left

495
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
nine minutes thanks

496
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,320
so

497
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
uh one of the things that we want to do

498
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,560
is we want to consider what do we

499
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,839
actually want to model

500
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,199
as part of our policies as part of our

501
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,600
identities and at the root of it all is

502
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
trust uh i know we call it zero trust

503
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,880
but that's actually what we want is to

504
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
establish what can i trust what should i

505
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,600
trust and if we can model trust

506
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,360
then we we're able to describe the

507
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
relationships and how much we want to

508
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,120
trust it how much suspicion do i have of

509
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,560
a given system does that suspicion uh is

510
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
that over my threshold or under my

511
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
threshold that i'm willing to trust it

512
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
and if we maintain these models of trust

513
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,759
over time that also gives us the ability

514
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,040
to sunset the things that would no

515
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,600
longer meet our our trust so this

516
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,440
concept of trust even though we call it

517
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,639
zero trust

518
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,120
it's actually about managing the the

519
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
trust that's there

520
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,120
and

521
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,480
this to hit a to hit zero trust in a

522
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
large organization as well you have to

523
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,639
also get cooperation so you have to

524
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,560
start working with your infosec teams

525
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,639
get transparency between between the

526
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
various engineers and people who are who

527
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
are there

528
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,559
and so

529
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,319
the i mentioned before at the start you

530
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,919
have to get the software to be able to

531
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,760
make use of the xero trusts components

532
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,839
the the applications that are there

533
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,280
and you want to establish a good

534
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,839
relationship with with infosec

535
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,359
and one of the ways that i found is

536
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
effective is you always want to start

537
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,880
with something small something can get a

538
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,919
small

539
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,599
win i'm saying it's an easy one but it's

540
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
a but something that's tangible so if

541
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
you start with an application you say

542
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,640
we're going to apply zero trust controls

543
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,559
to an application this is something that

544
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,960
you talk to your infosec people about

545
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,679
they're gonna be interested in it

546
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,720
because they know that this is where the

547
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
world is heading and this actually gives

548
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
them something small that limits the

549
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,440
risk and gives you the ability to

550
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,559
experiment

551
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,679
and

552
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,600
you want to focus in the beginning you

553
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
want to focus on intra service

554
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,039
communication as opposed to inter

555
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,559
service you want to say how do the in

556
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,000
the individual components internally

557
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
communicate with each other

558
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,360
and that prevents you from affecting the

559
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,039
outside environment in the beginning in

560
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,080
the long run you want to actually

561
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
control inter service that's where your

562
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,039
high value is

563
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,720
but in your initial version when you're

564
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,799
doing that first application you want it

565
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,200
to be something that is smaller in scope

566
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,919
smaller in size reduce the risk make it

567
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,799
makes it palatable and also allows the

568
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
system to pivot if for some reason the

569
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
security model doesn't work out

570
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
and one of the things you want to do as

571
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
well is you want to regularly share your

572
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
findings with your infosec team engage

573
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,799
them in from the start tell them what

574
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,320
you're going to do get feedback from

575
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
them

576
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,120
treat them as a partner like they're

577
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,320
they're not a brick wall they're they

578
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
are partners in us getting to where we

579
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
want to go hitting our hitting our

580
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
requirements and as you start to develop

581
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,840
that trust you actually find that the

582
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
conversations will will shift and i'll

583
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,320
give you an example um previous

584
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
organization that i did some work with

585
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
they

586
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
i had a group of engineers who vented

587
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,600
for quite a significant period of time

588
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
about uh infosec saying oh you know

589
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,559
they're doing all these terrible things

590
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
all this red tape that's going on

591
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
and after about 20 minutes i stopped

592
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,160
them and i said have you considered

593
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
their side of the

594
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,559
have you considered influence point of

595
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,679
view on this because you're talking

596
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,960
about the red tape you're running into

597
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
they're living and breathing it so any

598
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
advice you can give them

599
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,960
or any information you can give them

600
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,400
maybe there's a process change that you

601
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
could that would help you understand

602
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
what they need in order to help you

603
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,880
succeed

604
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,520
help help them help you don't just

605
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
sit there and complain about it and in

606
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,640
fact

607
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,160
in some scenarios they may even say hey

608
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,679
we don't even have these controls it

609
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,880
might be something that you can build

610
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
easily that you can that you can work

611
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,320
through cncf or some other similar group

612
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
and get those controls built and

613
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,440
automate those particular portions and

614
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
end up in a better place so the next

615
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
time you run into these scenarios you

616
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
actually end up with an accelerated path

617
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,640
as opposed to

618
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
getting stopped and having to do this

619
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,320
back and forth and missing your

620
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,760
deadlines because

621
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
the collaboration was too late

622
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
and once you've done that and you have

623
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,640
that first application you get that

624
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
early win then

625
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
show how

626
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,159
that intro service path ends up working

627
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,320
in inter service over time as well how

628
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
you can if you're careful on how you

629
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,919
demonstrate your interest service

630
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,440
communications you can then show how

631
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,880
these could then be applied at the broad

632
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
in the broader sense as you add more

633
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,600
controls in a careful way

634
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,400
and

635
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,919
the other thing that as well remember we

636
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
talked about policy and standards once

637
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,120
you have this in place you actually have

638
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,799
something tangible that you can point

639
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,960
towards policy and standards because

640
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,799
if there's not a policy if there's not a

641
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
standard we can't have thousands of

642
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,679
little exceptions everywhere you have to

643
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,200
actually get it into the policy you have

644
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,799
to get it to be to be part of the

645
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,120
standard so you could say policy we're

646
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
going to use your trust workload

647
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,679
identities

648
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
standard we're using spiffy you know the

649
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
procedure here's how you install spire

650
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,760
so by helping set these things up and

651
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,520
actually collaborating with infosec with

652
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
them you actually become

653
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,559
a collaborator with them and you end up

654
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,159
helping them de-risk the things that you

655
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,080
want to see there and you actually get

656
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
the things that you want in there while

657
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
at the same time helping maintain that

658
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,360
maintain that security

659
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,880
make sure you also engage with the

660
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,200
community as well so there's a lot of

661
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,520
really great resources we have cncf

662
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,320
security tag we have the kubernetes

663
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,200
security group and all of these all

664
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,840
these groups have people who are

665
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
very interested in seeing you succeed in

666
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,360
this particular space and so and people

667
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,640
from different walks of life some from

668
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
vendors some from end users so engage

669
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,159
with the community they're they're here

670
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,440
to help

671
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,799
they're here to

672
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,440
to help also set paula like guidelines

673
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
that people can follow as well

674
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,960
so there's a lot of different areas that

675
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
you can actually help collaborate with

676
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,039
and find what those best practices are

677
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,640
across a wide group and then those feed

678
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
back into your into your

679
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,039
organizations so it ends up becoming

680
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,799
this feedback loop where you get a wide

681
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,240
variety of

682
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,280
of people and a lot of eyes on on things

683
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,120
that we end up with something that's way

684
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
better than just a small team in a

685
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
company by itself looking at so

686
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
definitely get involved bring bring your

687
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
colleagues bring bring your friends

688
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,799
you'll get a lot out of it

689
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,960
and finally make sure to help your peers

690
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,919
learn

691
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,960
because

692
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,600
these type of things it's it's not

693
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,919
it's not something that we can do by

694
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,840
ourselves you know we we need to make

695
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,000
sure that we de-risk it by making sure

696
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
we have a lot of people who don't

697
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,200
understand and can work with it they can

698
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
also help us find where the holds are

699
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,159
and

700
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,159
at the end of the at the end of the day

701
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,240
we all want to practice very important

702
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
we want to practice self-care we don't

703
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,679
want to burn out we don't want to end up

704
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,280
in a in a bad place physically and

705
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
mentally and the only way we do that is

706
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,039
by helping our peers helping our

707
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,080
colleagues

708
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,480
learn and helping them and help set up

709
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,559
the system in such a way that we can

710
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,919
that we can

711
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,360
step away for for periods of time

712
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
um so if you notice the fame effect of

713
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
communication and collaboration is key

714
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
so keep this in mind if there's nothing

715
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
else to take out of this

716
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
keep keep this thought in mind

717
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,400
um

718
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,039
and finally there's a little term that i

719
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
like uh superior

720
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,640
i probably butchered the uh the way you

721
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
say it but it's like there to know so

722
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,039
don't stop learning don't take ownership

723
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,320
go ahead and

724
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,559
spend the time to to learn

725
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,080
not necessarily saying work harder but

726
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,799
work smarter work with your friends

727
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,480
collaborate with people so thank you

728
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,720

729
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,400
