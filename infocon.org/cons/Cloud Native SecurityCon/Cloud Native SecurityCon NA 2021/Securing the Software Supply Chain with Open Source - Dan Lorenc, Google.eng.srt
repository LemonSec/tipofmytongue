1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,159
yeah thanks uh my name is dan lawrence

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,760
um i'm talking about securing the supply

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,759
chain with open source how many people

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,279
were at supply chain security con

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
yesterday

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
quite a few people

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
um cool so i'm this is basically a

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
little bit of a recap a summary of that

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
for today so sorry for going over some

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,560
old stuff again let me go kind of quick

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,800
and then re-show the premiere of

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,760
operation salsa the video explaining uh

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,439
how to secure supply chain with the

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,320
salsa framework

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,840
um so i've been working in open source

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,519
security for a while um this is a quick

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,000
before and after picture um

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
this is about when pops wig was up to

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,840
date um this is what i looked like at

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
the start of the pandemic and when i

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,800
started worrying about open source and

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,079
supply chain security and this is a

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
little bit more accurate today

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,000
so this has been a long time and the

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
more you look and the more you worry

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,039
about supply chain security the more

27
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
stuff you find it's a pretty scary field

28
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
today

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,079
so i'm going to start out just by

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,120
talking about open source we've got some

31
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
numbers here

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,760
i'm not going to go too far to it this

33
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
is an open source conference how many

34
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,559
people here commit to open source

35
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,640
projects

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
okay awesome pretty much everybody uh

37
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,760
then i'm gonna talk about some of the

38
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
problems a little bit and then end with

39
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
that exciting video

40
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
uh so this was a couple recent surveys

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,720
from soda type

42
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
venture beat a bunch of other ones 90 to

43
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
98 of all modern organizations are using

44
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,439
open source i think the other two

45
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,439
percent are lying or confused or didn't

46
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,600
understand the question they filled out

47
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
it's it's impossible to build software

48
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
today without using open source in some

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,320
way

50
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
the numbers are pretty shocking too

51
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,640
though this is one or two things

52
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,360
everyone is using 135 software

53
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,560
components

54
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
on average but depending on the

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,439
framework depending on the ecosystem

56
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
it's not uncommon to see this go out to

57
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,399
the thousands and many thousands um if

58
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,759
you've heard the word s bomb or that

59
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
phrase program a lot it's about getting

60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,119
all this information tracked in one

61
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,560
place and as you can see the

62
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,000
combinatorics and numbers start to blow

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,520
up so this becomes really important

64
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
really fast

65
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
open source is everywhere

66
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
and particularly cloud native right

67
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,840
cloud native is built on open source all

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
the cloud native tools the landscape

69
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
that everybody loves to see and watch

70
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
and make fun of because it grows so much

71
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,199
that's all open source software and it's

72
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
amazing the innovation that everyone is

73
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
doing publicly

74
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
but open source has been under attack

75
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,319
over the last several years right so

76
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,520
it's awesome that we've done all this in

77
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
public and now we need to take time to

78
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
protect that public good together

79
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
particularly these last couple years

80
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
right open source is often funded and

81
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
worked on by maintainers that do this in

82
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,200
their spare time

83
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
the kubernetes release process itself is

84
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959
driven by a couple individuals that do

85
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,800
this in their volunteer process

86
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
kubernetes is one of the most active

87
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,519
projects in the world with hundreds of

88
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,360
maintainers but there's still only a few

89
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
people cranking turning the crank on the

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
release process and actually making sure

91
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
the artifacts get out there securely

92
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
when we see this all over if the

93
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
foundations are not strong at the bottom

94
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
of most open source projects because

95
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,200
we're just not paying attention to them

96
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,360
um at the same time these funding issues

97
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
the burnout issues everybody getting

98
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
tired of responding to things on github

99
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,480
uh it's becoming more important and more

100
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,239
critical are starting to see open source

101
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,480
supply chain attacks grow like crazy

102
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
a couple surveys had a 430 percent

103
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,319
increase in 2020. there was just another

104
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,840
one with a 650 increase from sona type

105
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
and i think the eu predicted a 400

106
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,599
increase next year so these are

107
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,799
happening more and more often

108
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
so time to turn it around time to get

109
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
motivational what can we do to help

110
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,879
there are a bunch of different projects

111
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,080
kirsten just mentioned some great ones

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
in this space like six store tacton

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
chains the entotle project the update

114
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
framework all these things in the linux

115
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,680
foundation and different open source

116
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
foundations and here in the cncf as well

117
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
a lot of us putting these pieces

118
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,799
together

119
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,760
a lot of it is just taking this

120
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
seriously and working together as an

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
industry thinking about open source

122
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,080
security thinking about supply chain

123
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
security is the most important first

124
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
step because that's what led us here is

125
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
people not thinking about it and not

126
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
worrying about it

127
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,319
so i have a couple memes here kind of

128
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
showing the issue i have a few versions

129
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
of this one so i'll show

130
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
um yeah then this is the reality of

131
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,599
things today right we're we've been very

132
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,200
comfortable for years

133
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
building and deploying our

134
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,360
modern brand new cloud native kubernetes

135
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
applications uh to these uh amazingly

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
scalable infrastructures but in a lot of

137
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
cases these things are getting built and

138
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,519
deployed on jenkins servers sitting on

139
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
mac minis under somebody's desk

140
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
and that's the problem here

141
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,279
your build system should be at least as

142
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
secure as the environment that it's

143
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,479
deploying things into

144
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,560
if you with one takeaway it's treat your

145
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,680
build system the same way you do your

146
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
production environments

147
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
here's another version of it a little

148
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
bit more tidally from this year and

149
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
pulling back in the other supply chain

150
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,520
metaphor

151
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
um yeah the world software supply chains

152
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,080
and one person

153
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
underpaid or not paid at all in a lot of

154
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
these open source cases

155
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
trying to fix this on their own

156
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,800
and this is the real issue we need to

157
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
find those people we need to support

158
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,599
them we need to help them as an industry

159
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
so along that theme is a new initiative

160
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,639
called the salsa framework or slsa

161
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,280
slsa.dev

162
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,639
and this is being developed by the open

163
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,360
source security foundation the open ssf

164
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,080
which is a sister foundation to the cncf

165
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
i mean it defines a bunch of levels here

166
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,639
right how can you get started taking

167
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
these things seriously how can you get

168
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,520
started protecting your build system

169
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,880
defines levels from one all the way up

170
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,199
to four

171
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,880
so if i worried you if i scared you

172
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
about open source security to start out

173
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,440
here

174
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,919
the salsa project is here to help so let

175
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,600
me switch over to that and i will end

176
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
with this awesome

177
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
video which you can find on youtube and

178
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
on twitter

179
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,160
i might have to plan this out here

180
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,600
should it be good

181
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,659

187
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,639
you all know why you're here

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,400
software supply chains all over the

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
world are being hacked and we need to

190
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
get to the bottom of it does everybody

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,960
remember what salsa is

192
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
well we don't have much salsa in iowa i

193
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,479
expected more fair day

194
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,160
it's just a dip

195
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
for chips right

196
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
come on picante let's get serious

197
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,639
let me remind you salsa is the supply

198
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
chain levels for software artifacts it's

199
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
a framework that you can use to ensure

200
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
the integrity of your software supply

201
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,479
chain it ranges from levels one through

202
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
level four and as you go higher in level

203
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,479
the more secure your software supply

204
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,800
chain becomes today we're going to use

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
salsa to figure out why software supply

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
chains all over the world are being

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
breached and we're going to use it to

208
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
neutralize the threat

209
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,199
agent queso the screen

210
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:06,319
[Music]

211
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,560
this is a big problem as i'm sure you've

212
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
noticed supply chain attacks have been

213
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,160
increasing in the past few months and

214
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
we've seen it in the mainstream news

215
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,919
trillions of dollars have been lost and

216
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,759
that's why it is more important than

217
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,680
ever to secure your software supply

218
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
chain your supply chain consists of many

219
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,160
steps from building your code testing it

220
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
to deploying it to production and you

221
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,440
may be depending on different

222
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
environments and using different

223
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,039
services as well that's why it's

224
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
important to make sure that every step

225
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,519
of the supply chain is secure at every

226
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,200
step you are vulnerable to a different

227
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
type of attack and that is why you need

228
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,958
to take different measures to make sure

229
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,000
that your entire chain is safe

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
does anybody have any questions

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,080
good agent queso water

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
we're under attack these supply chains

233
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
aren't going to secure themselves let's

234
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,080
go

235
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:19,920

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
yeah so i want to thank eric spencer

237
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
back here he produced these videos

238
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,080
give him a round of applause
