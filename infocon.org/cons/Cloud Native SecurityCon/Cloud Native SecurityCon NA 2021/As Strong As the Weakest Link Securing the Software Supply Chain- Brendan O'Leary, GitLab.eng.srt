1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,760
yeah thank you brandon uh yeah so i know

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,200
we haven't talked about supply chain

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
enough already so

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,720
we could spend some time on that today

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,120
but before we do a fun fact i just

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
learned from

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,960
uh the bird app is that hitchhiker's

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,039
guide to the galaxy was released on

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
october 12th 1979

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,480
exactly 42 years ago

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,920
that's your fun fact you learn nothing

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,840
else from this talk you can tell your

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,079
friends that fun fact today is the 42nd

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,680
anniversary of it

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,520
so yeah i i'm really honored to be here

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,880
and speak with you

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
um i'll introduce myself in more detail

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,120
in a little bit

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,079
um

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
but i want to talk first about a story

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
because

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
i think a lot of what we've heard about

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,600
securing the supply chain

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,680
great tools around doing it

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
maybe doesn't have all of the historical

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,879
context

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,440
uh that we we can give it

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,879
and and so it's important to think back

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
you know in our history when i i say in

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,600
our history i don't mean like

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,119
the early days of kubernetes i don't

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,119
mean before kubernetes existed i don't

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,799
mean uh really any history you or i

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,720
uh were around for you know this before

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,240
hitchhiker's guide for the galaxy long

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,439
before

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,920
you know it over the entire history of

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,799
like human society

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,240
where we've organized ourselves into

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,439
society

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,640
and

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
then had adversarial relationships with

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,240
other human beings

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
there's always been

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,240
supply chain attacks

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,799
always been a feature

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,960
adversarial relationships there were

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,439
wars over many years that were won and

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,119
lost on

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,840
uh you know the ability to control

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,439
uh your supply chain or that of your

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,880
adversary

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,280
in fact you know entire civilizations

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
have either thrived or perished

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,520
because of their supply chain or

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,040
logistics

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
in fact in the art of war uh sun tzu

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
writes that the line between disorder

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,318
and order lies in logistics

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,919
so this is something that's been around

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
a really long time

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
and the reason we're talking about it so

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,879
much right now

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,560
in our industry and in software is

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
because you know we've got this concept

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,160
that software has eaten the world and

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,000
because of that um now this kind of long

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,959
ago

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
you know supply chain style attack that

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
we've seen

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
is now something we see in in software

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
and so it's not that new right it goes

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
back to

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
times long before

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
and so in that sense that you know the

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,599
solar ones attack that you know it's uh

77
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
oftentimes cited as

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
one of the key

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
uh attacks that we saw to make us all

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
think more about supply chain

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,319
isn't really that new

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,000
uh but it also doesn't mean that there's

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
nothing to learn from it

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
so i think it's been mentioned a few

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,599
times today in this

86
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,360
conference but solarwinds themselves

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
actually spoke

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,159
at the

89
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,519
supply chain security conference

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
yesterday

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,599
they had fantastic technical details in

92
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,800
that talk

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
about you know all of the

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,319
technical things that went wrong went

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
right all of the efforts their team put

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,519
in

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
after the event

98
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,760
i want to talk about some of those today

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120
but i

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,319
also want to talk about the human

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,760
factors and then some other factors that

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,519
we don't often

103
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
bring into the discussion around supply

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,799
chain

105
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,720
because it's not just about this you

106
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
know single event um it's kind of easy

107
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
to point the finger and say oh here's

108
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,799
here's the thing that shows us supply

109
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,519
chain is important

110
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,640
but

111
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
you know it it's it's not new again it's

112
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,319
not new and we're going to talk about

113
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
why in fact

114
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
you know one of the the victims

115
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
of this uh attack

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
was actually the first people to report

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,040
it fireeye

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
they previously had written

119
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
a report

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,519
to

121
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,040
uh nist the national institute of

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,120
standards technology called the supply

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,599
chain risk management report

124
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,799
and they had talked about how

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,799
organizations

126
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
putting uh you know greater and greater

127
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,560
security and and maturing their security

128
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
position to the rest of the world

129
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,479
is is a good thing but it means that

130
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,639
adversaries will necessarily go up the

131
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,160
chain or down the chain in the supply

132
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,400
chain to then attack

133
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,479
um their real targets

134
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,479
right because solarwinds wasn't even the

135
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
target of this attack that we all call

136
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,638
you know solar winds or sunburst attack

137
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
and that's an and that's important it's

138
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,759
worth it's worth knowing just a little

139
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,120
bit more about what happened so that we

140
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,479
can talk about that

141
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,520
so if you weren't familiar with the

142
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
details attack again yesterday

143
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,520
you can get the real deal from from the

144
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
firsthand source if you watch the the

145
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
videos from yesterday

146
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,639
but just to give you a little flavor you

147
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,320
know it wasn't this kind of like

148
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,479
full-scale assault that you might think

149
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,360
of

150
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
when when you think of an attack right

151
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,600
it was

152
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,039
and it wasn't against the intended

153
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,120
target right solarwinds was not who was

154
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,440
targeted in this attack

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
they targeted solar winds

156
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
so that they could get

157
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,160
at their real targets

158
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,639
right the customers that solarwinds had

159
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,199
who relied heavily on the software that

160
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,280
solarwinds was producing

161
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
you know they installed that software

162
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
pervasively throughout their networks

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,080
um you know gave it expansive

164
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,199
permissions

165
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,720
and then accepted you know updates

166
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
directly from solarwinds and that's what

167
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
made them vulnerable uh to

168
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
an attack on solarwinds as part of their

169
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,440
supply chain

170
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
and again just to kind of give a little

171
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
bit more of a detailed overview

172
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
um

173
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
from from what we know

174
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,759
is you know this attack wasn't even

175
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,360
one point in time

176
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
uh the attackers were very sophisticated

177
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,880
and originally gained access to

178
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
the ci cd build structure or build

179
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,120
infrastructure rather

180
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
solarwinds built infrastructure

181
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,080
and

182
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
that gave them the ability to

183
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
to inject their own code into the

184
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
pipeline um where solarwinds was

185
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
building the orion product

186
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,000
and at first they kind of just tested

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
this right they didn't really

188
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
um

189
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
deliver the real payload there was this

190
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
thing called sunspot where they were

191
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,840
just kind of testing to see would they

192
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,440
be detected right they

193
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,160
inserted these dlls uh named them things

194
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,280
that

195
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,199
looked like and sound like classes that

196
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,759
solarwinds was already using

197
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,520
in the package so they didn't really

198
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
they wanted to know where are we going

199
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,199
to be noticed and when they realized

200
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,160
that

201
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,120
they were

202
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
able to get away with it then they uh

203
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
released sunburst which was the the real

204
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
trojanized code that got injected into

205
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
the orion software

206
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
but even that wasn't the end goal right

207
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
so

208
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
then they moved removed all the malware

209
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
that they had from the from the vms

210
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,639
where the builds were happening and the

211
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,240
code was signed

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
um to try and cover their tracks

213
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
and then it wasn't until later that they

214
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
then activated um

215
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,880
the the code

216
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
to understand you know

217
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
to actually get at the attackers the uh

218
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
their targets that they were looking at

219
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
and it was kind of aptly pointed out by

220
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
one ceo in a blog about it that you know

221
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,440
they're not the only ones that have this

222
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,039
kind of infrastructure there's you know

223
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,360
build machines that are signing code

224
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,800
um they're definitely not the only ones

225
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
vulnerable to this type of thing

226
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,160
and that's you know kind of the point of

227
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
this talk right we have this kind of web

228
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,759
of dependencies and we're going to talk

229
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,520
about that in more detail

230
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
but as we build our modern

231
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,639
infrastructure

232
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
on top of you know more and more

233
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
dependencies

234
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
you end up building on you know

235
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
something that eventually you don't know

236
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,879
right you have this little

237
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,720
little piece uh holding up everything

238
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,919
else and so we're gonna talk about that

239
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,280
today

240
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,400
um

241
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
again i as promised i'd introduce myself

242
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,639
i'm brendan o'leary i'm a developer

243
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,599
evangelist at get lab

244
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
i had the inverse problem that dan pop

245
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
was talking about

246
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
um or no sorry that dan lorenz was

247
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,960
talking about

248
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,879
his hair grew out from worrying about

249
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
supply chain i used to have hair before

250
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
i thought about supply chain security

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
now i don't

252
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,039
so yeah

253
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
i think that as it may

254
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,319
so

255
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,199
you know we talk about these

256
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
dependencies right we saw that funny

257
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
xkcd that talks about dependencies

258
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
and again we've talked a lot about that

259
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
today and these these tools to search

260
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
for dependencies and

261
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,159
talked about the software build

262
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
materials and all these things

263
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
but i want to really define what that is

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
because i think it's really important to

265
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,559
this concept of supply chain security

266
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,120
so of course a dependency is you know

267
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
traditionally what we think of is a open

268
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,720
source dependency that we bring into our

269
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,519
project a library to do something better

270
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
to interact with a known api

271
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
to interact with um

272
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,880
you know piece of hardware maybe we're

273
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
using right so this is some data from

274
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,959
the activers report

275
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,560
that shows you know the percentage of

276
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,959
of projects in different languages that

277
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
use open source dependencies this is not

278
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,240
news right we talked about this somewhat

279
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,839
this morning

280
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
but one thing that that doesn't cover

281
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,959
uh is transitive dependency so the the

282
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
graph we just saw was

283
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
dependencies things we specifically call

284
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,320
out in a package manager file or

285
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
elsewhere to say hey we've made a

286
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,440
decision to include this library

287
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
into our product

288
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,040
now the problem is though or or a

289
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
concern there is

290
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
that those dependencies come with

291
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
dependencies of their own right so you

292
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
end up with this web of dependencies

293
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
that come along with it

294
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,959
right and so this kind of graph kind of

295
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,720
shows us that and

296
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
um

297
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
as an amateur

298
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
ish

299
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
no developer i can attest to that

300
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
javascript line right there like if you

301
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
just look at node modules on this

302
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
computer in any file you'll you'll see

303
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
that that

304
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
that bears bears out

305
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
but these are the transitive

306
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
dependencies that we bring in

307
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,839
as we're adding these other

308
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,959
dependencies but it's not even just that

309
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,760
right

310
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,519
like that makes sense we've got open

311
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,880
source libraries we've got the code we

312
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
write right that's part of

313
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
what you know our is included in our

314
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,480
final product again that's not new

315
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,680
and then we said okay it's not those

316
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
libraries it's also

317
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
other third-party libraries that we

318
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
bring in maybe those are you know ones

319
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
that come along with these open source

320
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,079
dependencies

321
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,079
maybe they're closed source ones like

322
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,760
you know

323
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,279
things used to access the operating

324
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,839
system or from some vendor that again

325
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,360
hardware vendor or

326
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,040
some api we're using that's that's

327
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,320
closed

328
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,480
right but that the library then really

329
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,040
is a dependency as well

330
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
and then of course both of those have

331
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
their own open source and maybe closed

332
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
source dependencies

333
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
right this is where

334
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,959
when left pad gets taken out of the mpm

335
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
registry all of a sudden nobody can

336
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
build right not that many people were

337
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
pulling left pad

338
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,920
to pad some numbers into their code but

339
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
they had depended on something that was

340
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,519
doing you know how they were doing their

341
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,320
ajax calls and that thing was depending

342
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,040
on left path right

343
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
and and there's more right so then you

344
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,800
have what about our devops process right

345
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
we heard this this morning

346
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,680
what about

347
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,040
all the things that we're doing to get

348
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,279
code into production

349
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,600
that is a dependency

350
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
um we've saw that in the solarwinds

351
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,399
attack right it's

352
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,920
a clear dependency to our production

353
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,120
environment and then there's our

354
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
production environment

355
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,519
and then of course in there

356
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,680
are a bunch of other vendors with a big

357
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,480
s

358
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
and they have a lot of open source

359
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
dependencies that they rely on and they

360
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
probably have a lot of closed source

361
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,240
proprietary stuff they rely on right so

362
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
this web gets a lot bigger than just oh

363
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,000
these are the dependencies called out in

364
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
my files

365
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
and so i think it's key to understand

366
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,279
that the sum total of all those

367
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
dependencies really

368
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,560
is what you should think of when you're

369
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
talking about supply chain

370
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,399
um

371
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
and so

372
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
so okay so let's talk about then what is

373
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,710
a supply chain

374
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,440
[Music]

375
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
yeah

376
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
so we got that i thought we had 20

377
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,880
minutes no just 10. oh

378
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,320
um great sorry that must have been

379
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,000
returned

380
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,160
