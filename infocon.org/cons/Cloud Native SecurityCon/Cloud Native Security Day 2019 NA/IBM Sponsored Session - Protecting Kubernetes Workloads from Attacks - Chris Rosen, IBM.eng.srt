1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,300
all right good morning thanks everyone

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,759
my name is Chris Rosen I've got a very

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,710
tight five-minute time line that I've

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,509
been told I need to adhere to or else so

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,250
what we want to do is quickly kind of

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,740
talk through something that is not a new

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,680
story to anyone in this room at least I

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,990
assume not and that's about you know

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,779
being able to run workloads and being

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,750
aware of contacts anyone that you know

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,029
has kids in that age group of playing

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,640
fortnight or maybe you play yourselves

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,559
you're fully aware of you know the

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,120
constant attack that you're under as

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,910
well as the time stuck that that game

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,840
turns into so once upon a time think

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,030
about as a developer I'm sitting down

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,450
and I've written this fantastic idea and

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,059
I've scripted up and I'm you know I'm

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,910
think containers and micro services and

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,800
all the you know the modern technology

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,930
to be able to run and develop this new

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,020
application but I've done so in the

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,170
confines of my laptop which are great

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,360
but now I need to take that application

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,119
to the primetime stick so how do I go

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,140
through that transformation that

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,390
developer that we started with just like

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,000
you just like the entire ecosystem has

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,450
chosen kubernetes as that container or

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,479
customers two years ago it was really a

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,150
hot discussion over which type of

33
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,159
orchestration you were going to leverage

34
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,070
and build on top of the day clearly

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,140
kubernetes and all the benefits that are

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,920
inherent to it

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,400
with Auto recovery and auto scaling and

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,329
deployments load balancing though she's

39
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,119
chosen that right so now the next step

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,180
in that transformation is where do I run

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,780
that so what she does is she goes and

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,729
she talks to her she puts in a support

43
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,759
ticket for her IT team and he says oh

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,950
well we don't have kubernetes cluster

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,060
yet I'm really busy you know

46
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,579
rewiring the datacenter so she's hit

47
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,439
this roadblock what do I do

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
so she comes up with that little brain

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,290
baby and says the cloud I will run this

50
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,420
workload in the cloud I will be able to

51
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,969
take this super-awesome application that

52
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,859
I just developed run it in the cloud all

53
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,590
been here before her what I like to call

54
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,629
the internal mall cops some people may

55
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,970
not like that affectionate term as much

56
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,150
and think of security or your seaso does

57
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,579
no we're not ready to run that you can't

58
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,769
deploy your own shadow IT and start

59
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:43,439
running workloads cloud now there are a

60
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,530
number of managed services not only an

61
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,720
IBM cloud but every other cloud that you

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,569
may have already heard of jumping

63
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,310
onboard with kubernetes as at

64
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,310
orchestration platform though some of

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,349
the things that you'll get an IBM you

66
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,450
know around simplified deployment

67
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,030
lifecycle management integrated

68
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,909
operational tools compute isolation

69
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,150
including bare metal it was she's trying

70
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,799
to think about how do I run that

71
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,840
application and how do I move it to the

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,590
cloud and do so in a secure way so

73
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,609
out-of-the-box

74
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,859
kind of the first environment is I

75
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:23,400
create this cluster I've got my Al B's

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,459
I've got my super cool new application

77
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,040
all running and tane Erised

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,560
but you can see here everything is fully

79
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,629
accessible on the frontside network and

80
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:36,209
therefore you know I really have a lot

81
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,370
of risk I have a large attack surface

82
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,650
for all of my worker nodes in that

83
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,419
cluster so what do I do it will play out

84
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,079
this demo

85
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,560
but I couldn't type this fast

86
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,370
essentially what we're going to do is

87
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,380
we're going to go through we're gonna

88
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,420
log in this is the beautiful shell

89
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,880
script most likely you're gonna automate

90
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,920
this with terraform or some other

91
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,110
automation tool of your choice to be

92
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,120
able to handle all of this lifecycle

93
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,399
management so essentially we're doing

94
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,260
first we're gonna log in now the next

95
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,209
step is we're going to create this

96
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,750
cluster nice long lots of options things

97
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,200
that you figure in tweak again probably

98
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,850
do this once but then you're gonna go

99
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,250
forward and automate it something

100
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,540
repeatable and auditable with careful

101
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,890
now that it's deployed I'm gonna go

102
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,480
through and I'm gonna actually check and

103
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,520
check the health around the cluster

104
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,830
itself as well as the health of all the

105
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,240
worker nodes that are running inside

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,940
that cluster and then the last step for

107
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,570
that we're going to do here is actually

108
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,810
deploy this super secret very impressive

109
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,730
application that I had started out

110
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,040
developing on my laptop now I'm gonna

111
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,290
run that out in the cloud and see

112
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,490
through it's going to go through we're

113
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,620
gonna deploy some pods and services and

114
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,419
get normal health check on things that

115
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,530
are happening once it's done we can open

116
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,910
up a browser and we're gonna see well it

117
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,140
wasn't that great of an app but it was

118
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,520
just a guestbook app so what did we

119
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,440
actually do out of all of that that

120
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,360
command-line that long string of stuff

121
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,850
essentially what we did is create a

122
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,550
kubernetes cluster that leverages

123
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,669
creates three different worker pools one

124
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,979
is like a DMZ where I've got my firewall

125
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,220
I've got my Gateway all of my traffic

126
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,990
routes through that then I've got an

127
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,970
edge worker pool where my application

128
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,760
load balancers reside and then all of my

129
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,860
intellectual property is running down

130
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,990
here completely segregated an air-gap

131
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,620
from the rest of the outside world when

132
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,180
we look at you know you could do the

133
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,250
same thing in the UI if you're a point

134
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,410
click love pretty pictures you can do

135
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,720
that UI as well you can see the health

136
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,580
you can see the three different worker

137
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,030
pools that I had and lastly is that

138
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,070
we're here to help you be successful in

139
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,729
that

140
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,499
transformation that journey wherever you

141
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,120
are with a native application

142
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,330
development or app modernization running

143
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,680
it and a managed service of that way you

144
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,860
focus just on your line of business but

145
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,230
with that I was pretty close time time

146
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,679
