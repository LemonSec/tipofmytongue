1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,600
all right everyone ready to get started

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,330
with our final push to the end so we're

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,040
just going to do an open space closing

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,809
real quick just for a couple minutes and

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,299
then we'll hand it off to our final

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,580
speakers of the day and then we'll just

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,070
do a quick closing and then we'll move

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,080
right into happy hour happy hour is

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,340
going to be right outside where there

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,070
was lunch but to close off the open

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,449
spaces so what do you think about open

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,830
spaces especially if it was your first

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,600
time yeah yeah a couple cont comments I

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,350
got enjoyed having deep engaging

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,059
conversations and then you were able to

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,820
identify the expert in the room or a

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,739
couple experts in the room and then go

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,379
and have that conversation maybe more

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,110
in-depth or specific to your needs out

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,610
in the hallway or something like that so

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,500
using the open spaces the way to really

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,539
find those key people that you want to

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,920
talk to and add into your network who's

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,300
got something that they want to share

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,119
that they liked about open spaces who

26
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,500
has something that they would like to

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,119
share about open spaces who there's

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,640
something that they learned or something

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,520
that they enjoyed how about you Erin

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,280
okay yeah one of the things I thought

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,630
was really interesting we were talking

32
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,790
about how to get the community excited

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,060
about container security or security and

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,650
kubernetes together that was the how do

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,509
you get people involved who are not here

36
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,850
yes exactly that right so the note was

37
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,280
how do we get people who are not here to

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,920
prioritize container security and one of

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,350
the conclusions we came to isn't so much

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,540
that the kubernetes community isn't

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,040
excited about security is that we

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,390
probably need to go to the security

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,649
community and get them excited about

44
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,390
communities mm-hmm I thought that was a

45
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,430
cool concise take away you know

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,790
automating the security in the

47
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,590
humanities the first topic and great fun

48
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,390
we had a great discussion about it the

49
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,909
group but in the finally what we found

50
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,729
out was there is no end-to-end automated

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,700
security as of today it is not possible

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,560
to implement but some of

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
the tools are there which can do most

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,630
things so that's one thing they came out

55
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,010
of a day yeah I learned a lot anyone

56
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,450
else just maybe one or two more people

57
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,760
thought I saw him all right I'm gonna

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,900
just pick someone how about you yeah you

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,310
were super excited when I saw you this

60
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,130
morning so um so this is great um it's

61
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,590
it's actually it's been since I've been

62
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,200
to a chef conf that I had an experience

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,269
with open spaces and I think this is a

64
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,410
really good thing that should be a part

65
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,130
of every conference to get people

66
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,260
together to talk about the things that

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,319
they're mostly just listening to it's so

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,840
easy to go to a conference and just you

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,239
know go to go to a talk listen and then

70
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,340
not participate but you know this kind

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,380
of event forces people to look at each

72
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,630
other in the eye and say what do you

73
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,010
what do you know what do you have to

74
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,780
share and this is what I have to share

75
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,870
so it's really good because it forces

76
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,720
you to get to know people and if if you

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,549
don't want to do that then follow the

78
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,470
law of two feet take yourself to

79
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,019
somewhere else where you'd rather be and

80
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:31,560
you know everyone's happy little

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,750
applause all right last one there's a

82
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,209
lot of seats over here on this side feel

83
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,310
free to walk through people I think the

84
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,079
very first point in our retrospective

85
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,560
about the event will be rounds round

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,639
tables so no bueno it's a little hard to

87
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,380
get through so and one other thing

88
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,859
anyone want to share how about you Sarah

89
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,299
what did you think of the open spaces I

90
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,500
really enjoyed the discussion about

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,280
immutability and auditability that you

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,350
you know I perspective you can't really

93
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,780
trust your auditing if it's not

94
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,730
immutable but what does it really mean

95
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,590
for kubernetes to be immutable just

96
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,070
because you can restart your containers

97
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,209
you know just cuz you can restart

98
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,039
instances doesn't actually mean they're

99
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,478
immutable but maybe it's close enough

100
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,320
and it was just a really interesting

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,040
congressman awesome though

102
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,450
a big round of applause for yourselves

103
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,470
there's a couple things that I worry

104
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,910
about when I help run these and

105
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,670
facilitate these open spaces is one and

106
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,800
making sure that people are engaged in

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,530
the conversation and I know culturally

108
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,520
different cultural backgrounds for

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,860
people you know some cultures aren't as

110
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,450
open and are willing to have

111
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,860
conversations that they open and things

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,100
like that so I appreciate that everyone

113
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,420
put their effort into it and made it a

114
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,220
rewarding experience and then the other

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,750
thing that I love to see is the other

116
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,520
worry about open spaces that people just

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,070
decide to go back to the hotel sleep or

118
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,710
go have a drink somewhere or whatever

119
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,050
and you've all stuck around and you've

120
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,510
come back for our last Speaker of the

121
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,720
day our speakers of the day Jerry J and

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,750
Aaron ready to go yeah we're ready are

123
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,830
pretty sure
