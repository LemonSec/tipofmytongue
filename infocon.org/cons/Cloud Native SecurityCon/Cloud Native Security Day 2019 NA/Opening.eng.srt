1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
good morning well it's 9 o'clock seems

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,460
like we have quorum so I think we are

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,960
ready to start the day if you want to

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,469
find your seat thank you all very much

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,360
for deciding to spend your day with us

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,550
there was a lot of co-located events so

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,439
we appreciate you making the hard

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,119
decision to spend the time with us and

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,369
hopefully we can deliver you a good day

10
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,740
today my name is Michael Ducey I'm one

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,050
of the members of six security I work

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,269
for a company called statistic and I

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,850
helped maintain a CNC F open-source

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,840
project called Falco so the day is not

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,510
about me though however so I'd give you

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,920
a little bit of overview over the

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,860
schedule we're gonna have sessions for

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,530
about an hour and a half we'll take a 30

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,200
minute break the break will be kind of

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,090
in and out here there should be snacks

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,059
also when we have lunch lunch will be

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,010
outside as well and then we can use the

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,530
tables in here to eat and then we're

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,000
going to do something called open spaces

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
which I'll talk about here in a second

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,270
who has no idea what open spaces are all

27
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,689
right who's that who's ever done an open

28
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,460
space

29
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,409
alright so everyone who just raised

30
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,150
their hand who have done an open space

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,479
you have been nominated as volunteers

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,900
you have all volunteered as tribute to

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,580
help make sure that the open spaces go

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,189
well I'll explain open spaces here in

35
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,700
just in a second and then to make sure

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,320
that you don't wander away too far

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,900
during open spaces we have a closing you

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,939
know and the closing talk is going to be

39
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,850
on the kubernetes security audit that

40
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,009
happened over the summer which should be

41
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,759
some good contents to keep you around at

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,500
least that's the idea if that doesn't

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,939
keep you around there's a short happy

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,920
hour before we move into the lightning

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,290
talks that the CNC office hosting as

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,590
part of Google if you need a QR code

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,840
there's a sign outside the door you can

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,399
scan this it'll take you right to the

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,960
schedule as well they can take in a

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,140
photo so where are we going to be today

51
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,470
so we're in this room right now where it

52
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,800
says C n SD ballroom a

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,690
and then we're gonna have open spaces in

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,730
this room so we'll have two groups for

55
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,950
open spaces in here and then we'll have

56
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,800
four rooms that one two three four you

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,580
can see down in the corner with a chair

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,460
setup we can use that space as well and

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,140
this will make a lot more sense to you

60
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,940
when I explain what open spaces are

61
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,430
we'll do in a second

62
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,510
of course this day wouldn't be possible

63
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,400
without our sponsors so a big thank you

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,890
to our sponsors let's give them a big

65
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,910
round of applause and also the day

66
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,920
wouldn't be possible without the CNC F

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,100
taking this idea this was an idea that

68
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,340
we proposed on six security and we

69
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,800
decided we wanted to do it the sig

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,660
chairs were very very supportive of us

71
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,140
and a small team of us got together to

72
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,300
put together this day and the cloud

73
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,770
native computing foundation helped

74
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,690
sponsor the day as well and they said

75
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,470
that they would take financial

76
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,930
responsibility and then of course the

77
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,120
sponsors helped with that as well so big

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
thank you to the CNC F for hosting this

79
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,060
force as well

80
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,230
and one person I want to thank one

81
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,240

unfortunately she was not able to make

84
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,240
it today but she knew she wasn't gonna

85
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,390
be here at koukin and she just ran with

86
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,830
this and helped us organize this event

87
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,600
and something that she's not even going

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,210

89
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,590

104
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,100
with all Linux Foundation CN CF events

105
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,350
there is a code of conduct this is the

106
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,900
link if there's an issue or a problem

107
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,449
please find me or find one of the scenes

108
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,330
yes staff members and the blue shirts

109
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,340
and we'll be happy to help you hope you

110
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,449
are so let's talk about open spaces and

111
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,760
let me just get my timer back up so I

112
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,150
know make sure I'm on time here there we

113
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,690
go all right so open spaces is a style

114
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,889
of unconference

115
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:04,020
and so one of the things that we wanted

116
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,340
to try and accomplish by putting

117
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,289
together this day is that we wanted to

118
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,720
have the industry experts and the you

119
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,430
know people come up and speak to you

120
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,410
give you kind of their idea of how

121
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,410
they're doing things in the security

122
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,520
world in the cloud native world but

123
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,320
those style of conferences we we tend to

124
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,030
do them over and over and over again and

125
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,979
you're gonna spend the next three days

126
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,160
here having people on stage talking to

127
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,139
you fire time and you'll have this

128
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,849
hallway track that goes on or you'll

129
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,770
find a table at lunch and you sit down

130
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,570
and you start talking to people then you

131
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,310
have these natural organic conversations

132
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,349
about what really matters you start to

133
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:41,940
come out and those tend to be extremely

134
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,710
valuable but open spaces is is

135
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,570
essentially a way that we can structure

136
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,180
the hallway tract for you so those

137
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,270
unstructured conversations that just you

138
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,710
can explain your problem you can get

139
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,539
feedback and get advice from your peers

140
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,849
and the people who aren't always on

141
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,570
stage talking about what they're do so

142
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,199
this is a picture from Spotify so it

143
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,180
must be good right and so this is

144
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,770
essentially what we're going to do today

145
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,570
we're going to build this schedule we

146
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,820
have this board big white board in the

147
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,220
back there's post-it notes back there as

148
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,770
well and what we're going to do is we're

149
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,330
going to write down our ideas for topics

150
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,070
that we want to discuss during the open

151
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,370
space

152
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,470
time you just put your post-it note up

153
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,320
on the board and then during lunch we're

154
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,240
going to come up with a schedule of what

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,100
the afternoon is going to look like make

156
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,389
sense so there's a schedule and then

157
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:37,979
there's also the rules and I'm gonna go

158
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,690
through the rules and the rules just

159
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,010
allow us to have a little bit of

160
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,020
structure so that it's not complete

161
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,460
anarchy in the unconference right so

162
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,630
I've already talked about this but the

163
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,190
schedule is going to look like this I

164
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,960
will fill this in and this will be on

165
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,850
the screen in here while we're doing the

166
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,949
open spaces I'll also make sure that we

167
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,630
tweet a photo out of it so that it's

168
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,400
easily accessible and you can find it

169
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,530
and then of course it'll be back there

170
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,870
as well so we're going to have six

171
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,610
different spaces and we're gonna have

172
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,370
four different time slots which means we

173
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,970
need how many ideas 24 very good very

174
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,340
good that's why you work in computer

175
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,710
science I guess so we need 24 topics so

176
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,180
it's really up to you to build what your

177
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,460
afternoons gonna look like in this

178
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,220
format so let's go over some of the

179
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,330
rules real quick so one rule is whoever

180
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,700
comes our is the right people or are the

181
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,860
right people so whoever is there for

182
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,270
that conversation of the people that you

183
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,650
needed to have for that particular

184
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,280
conversation so make sure the other

185
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,900
thing I want to say about this is make

186
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,520
sure that if it's a large group as well

187
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,740
that you're noticing when somebody's

188
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,270
trying to get into the conversation and

189
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,550
it's always helpful to have somebody who

190
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,840
kind of helps facilitate the

191
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,490
conversation and is actually watching

192
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,889
for somebody who wants to speak up and

193
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,380
isn't able to and had make sure that

194
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,270
everyone gets a chance to bring their

195
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,930
opinion to the table whatever happens

196
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,750
happens so don't necessarily be

197
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,970
disappointed in the result so if you

198
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,260
didn't get everything that you wanted

199
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,260
out of the conversation that's fine you

200
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,360
can always move on and go to the next

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,050
conversation when it starts is the right

202
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,660
time and also when it ends is the right

203
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,729
time however I've given you a very

204
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,289
strict schedule that you need to follow

205
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,570
but if you start 10 minutes late it's

206
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,479
okay if the conversation actually starts

207
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,190
in the hallway before while you're

208
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,260
waiting the room to free that's okay too

209
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,450
you also if you're done with the

210
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,250
conversation and you feel like you've

211
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,600
solved it in five minutes

212
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,950
don't feel like you need to belabor the

213
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,690
point and continue to have the

214
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,420
conversation go on and that's kind of

215
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,310
that point right there when it's over it

216
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,860
it's over and be comfortable walking

217
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,620
away from the conversation if you need

218
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,690
and then if you're not getting something

219
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,310
out of the conversation so you don't

220
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,340
necessarily need to verbally contribute

221
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,900
but if you're listening and you're not

222
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,430
getting anything out of the conversation

223
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,110
if it's not going in the direction that

224
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,810
you want feel free to use whatever means

225
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,210
available you to move yourself out of

226
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,860
that conversation and go find another

227
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,810
one that you might be more engaged in

228
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,670
nobody in the group should be offended

229
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,130
that you got up and walked away and so

230
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,290
feel free to do that because if you're

231
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,610
not contributing or you're not learning

232
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,530
anything then what's the point of

233
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,770
continuing to be there and then bring

234
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,710
your best self so this is just goes back

235
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,400
to being respectful of your fellow

236
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,540
people in the group making sure that

237
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,890
people are getting time to talk

238
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,350
there will be whiteboards or flip charts

239
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,330
in each one of the rooms as well that

240
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,310
you can use to write down any notes if

241
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,140
you need to park something and how cover

242
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,600
it later if you want to take notes as

243
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,120
well and share them out that's also a

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,340
good idea as well if somebody wants to

245
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,530
describe in the actual open space itself

246
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,890
so this takes us into our sessions so

247
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,590
first up any questions about open spaces

248
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:11,370
Before we jump into into the sessions so

249
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,740
the post-its will be back there

250
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,690
throughout the morning they'll feel free

251
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,670
to start just putting up your ideas and

252
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,650
your topics as you go in and out of the

253
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,020
room especially during break as well

254
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,610
alright we want to make sure that we

255
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,470
have enough topics so that by lunch time

256
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,120
we can actually go and build the

257
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,950
schedule during lunch all right so with

258
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,150
that we have a gentleman from IBM cloud

259
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,320
who's going to open the day for us

260
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,090
you

261
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:43,809
[Applause]
