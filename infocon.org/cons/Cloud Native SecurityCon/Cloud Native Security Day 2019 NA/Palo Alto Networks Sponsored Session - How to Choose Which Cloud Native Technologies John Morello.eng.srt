was the CTO at twistlock a lot of you

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,799
guys or at least a number of you guys in

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:14,910
the audience here are some of our

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,830
customers we were a founding member of

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,080
CN CF back when it started have been

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,869
very active in the eco system for about

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,640
five years now really since the very

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,340
beginning so we build a security

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,650
platform for containers and cloud native

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,230
services server lists VMs as well for

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,660
that matter and really that the point of

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,950
me being here is I just wanted to make

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,350
sure everybody understood that we once

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,540
we were acquired by Palo Alto Networks a

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,170
few months ago that that twistlock

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,250
capability doesn't change we're

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,350
continuing to be invested in CN CF as

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,460
you can see here with our platinum

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,850
sponsorship of of coop con we continue

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,550
to have our labs team doing the same

24
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,020
kind of first party offensive security

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,760
research that they've always done so we

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,739
found o days and in kubernetes and

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,750
docker and Linux itself and always

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,430
worked responsibly with the community to

29
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,110
disclose those none of that stuff

30
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,850
changes nor does the approach that we

31
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,830
take to building the product so the only

32
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,360
thing I want you guys to come away from

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,189

37
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,970
