1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,060
all right five minutes my name is Rosie

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,319
Jonny I'm CTO and founder of sysd I've

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,910
also been involved in open source for 15

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,080
years at this point I was one of the

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,970
part of the original team that created

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,029
the wall shark Network analyzer and

7
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,640
recently I've been the creator and

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,820
heavily engaged with Falco actually with

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,740
the amount of time that I have was

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,420
thinking in order to give you something

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,530
useful

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,590
I just want maybe to talk to you a

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,469
little bit about Falco Falco is a tool

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,250
for run time threat detection and run

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,850
time security for kubernetes Falco is

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,539
open source it's a part of CN CF and

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,730
essentially it works as an anomaly

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,949
anomaly detection engine that can take

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,590
multiple inputs for example system calls

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,620
that are captured by deploying the Falco

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,899
agent it can takes kubernetes audit

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,630
events and mixes all of these with

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,590
kubernetes metadata to produce alerts so

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,509
to tell you if something is wrong in

25
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,430
real time at runtime with your

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,659
kubernetes environment Falco is deployed

27
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,070
typically as a demonstrating kubernetes

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,820
so here in this slide you have the host

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,290
of a machine where there are multiple

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,270
containers that irani Falco runs is a

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,939
further container that you deploy on the

32
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,520
machine and running this container

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,640
deploys a BPF based instrumentation that

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,009
can collect data from the other

35
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,509
containers that are running on the

36
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,890
machine so one thing about Falco is

37
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,509
completely transparent and doesn't

38
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,240
require any modification to the

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,890
containers that are in the pods that are

40
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,570
scattered by kubernetes on the same

41
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,549
machine the other thing that Falco does

42
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,490
is it takes this diagram shows multiple

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,880
machines each of which with several

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,500
containers running and the color coding

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,200
here is the service that the containers

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,199
belong to and typically you know looking

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,580
at things like on the left side of the

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,990
slide is not

49
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,850
super useful in kubernetes you want to

50
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,350
essentially find all the containers that

51
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,270
are the same color so that are part of

52
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,280
the same service and treat them as a

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,980
unit when you define policies for them

54
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,300
or when you receive events or alerts for

55
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,110
them all right let's take a look

56
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,570
font too small all right

57
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:50,140
I noticed that suet is a site I notice

58
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,500
that the speaker's before me are smart

59
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,710
people and mostly the recordings for

60
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,510
their demo I am not as smart as them so

61
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,280
I will try to see if my conference

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,140
network allows me of course the moment I

63
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,070
go onstage I lose connectivity

64
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,680
completely everybody get off the Wi-Fi

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,210
yeah

66
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,660
which Wi-Fi

67
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,050
try to give it a second to see if I'm

68
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,410
lucky

69
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,409
dissipate I'm out let me quickly try to

70
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:59,298
switch to the conference one

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
okay looks like I have no network so I

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,790
cannot give the demo to you with Falco

73
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,300
I'm able essentially to collect

74
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,750
information in at run time and the demo

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,130
would have let me look at the logs

76
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,860
coming from my little kubernetes

77
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,350
kubernetes cluster that is running on

78
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,360
GAE and being able to exact into a

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,260
container and look at the output from

80
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,750
Falco that would have let me know oh it

81
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,210
worked now it took a while as you can

82
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,190
see I just exact inside the container

83
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,320
and Falco immediately tells me that by

84
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,210
looking at the kubernetes api that

85
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,100
somebody didn't exactly side the

86
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,440
container and that the shell was born

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,240
inside this inside this container and

88
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,190
now I'm inside this container so if I

89
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,290
can if I do malicious like activity for

90
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,450
example I don't know I can go and I can

91
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,750
modify modify a system binary which is

92
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,610
something that you should never see

93
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,430
again in real time Falco is telling me

94
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,020
that this file is being modified

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,380
and as you can see gives me context not

96
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,270
only the specific container but the

97
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,950
kubernetes pod the namespace and all of

98
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,700
the other information that I need sis

99
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,020
dig as a company offers actually a full

100
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,330
platform built around Falco that allows

101
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,880
essentially you to manage this engine

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,070
around your kubernetes cluster and there

103
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,110
also allows you to do much more than

104
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,300
just run time protection but just

105
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,740
something that puts together you know

106
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,260
multiple tools like Prometheus Falco is

107
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,080
the anchor in a complete work stream

108
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,210
that can offer you a lot of

109
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,820
functionality for a container security

110
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:07,780
for example here I'm logged into Cystic

111
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,850
secure and I see that there's a terminal

112
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,520
shelling container this is a file color

113
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,050
that is being captured essentially in a

114
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,180
centralized place by Cystic secure and I

115
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,610
can look at all of the details about

116
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,120
this event but as you can see

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,370
cystic secure was also able to take a

118
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,500
capture of this event while falco was

119
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,840
generating it so I can go in the end I

120
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,730
can analyze this capture and they can

121
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,300
essentially take a look at what happened

122
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,960
in this capture and I can see that there

123
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,000
was a bunch of activity around the

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,480
moment where this happened and I can

125
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,919
take a look at the comments that were

126
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,570
executed I can even take a look at the

127
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,940
payloads of course I don't have a lot of

128
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,160
time to show you all of these just want

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,139
to mention that we did did a big release

130
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,010
of cystic secure which have a lot of new

131
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,450
functionality and covers the full

132
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,260
lifecycle of containers run build run

133
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,560
and response so if you want to learn

134
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,320
more come to our booth we are both pre

135
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,290
paid 33 and we were putting these on the

136
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,850
tables we're actually giving away at our

137
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,639
booth the book Linux Linux of

138
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,340
observability with eb PF it's an orrery

139
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,200
book that is written by a laurenzo one

140
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
of the Cystic employees and if you show

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,950
up with one of these you will be you

142
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,020
will be able to get the book sign and

143
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,880
get get a free copy of the book it's a

144
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,430
really good book other than that thank

145
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,550
you very much and have a good rest of

146
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,630
the conference

147
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,560
[Applause]
