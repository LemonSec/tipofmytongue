1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
uh thank you and good afternoon and

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,840
welcome i am actually really honored to

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,160
be out here and uh getting to present

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,559
after two years of not presenting so

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,160
welcome to everyone here in person and

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,320
everyone joining us online uh it's

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,679
actually a real honor and it's actually

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,280
a privilege since it's my first time at

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,680
kubecon and securitycon and i'm just

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
curious with a show of hands how many of

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,199
you folks are new to the conference

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
all right well it's great to meet

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,960
everyone and hopefully i get a chance to

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,039
talk to you guys all you folks

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,439
today tomorrow and this week

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,079
all right so

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,520
session today is on the

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,040
five reasons

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,280
to invest in this in the software supply

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,719
chain and securing the software supply

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
chain and we cover some some myths as

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,920
well as to um you know things that come

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
up in the context of the supply chain

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,600
that we want to make sure that we uh we

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,079
address and get into the right context

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,199
as we

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
um as we look at investing in this area

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,039
so just a little bit about me i

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,760
got my start in wall street i.t i moved

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
to the west coast joined microsoft

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,680
primarily worked in systems management

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,920
virtualization management i got to work

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,760
with some standards organizations around

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,479
storage management primarily dmtf and

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,520
snea

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
and i got a chance to ship some cloud

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
on-prem products

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,640
as well and more recently i joined the

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,159
strategic missions and technologies

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320
group in microsoft where we focus on

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,560
supply chain and supply chain security

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,759
and so

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
at home i currently find myself

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,000
keeping my senior dogs from getting

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,159
annoyed by the new puppy that's been

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,799
introduced so that's always fun

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,920
all right

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
so with the talk all the talk this week

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,720
are on s-bomb supply chain at the

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
conference and just in general with what

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
we hear in the news and just the ongoing

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,119
and relentless relentless attacks uh

53
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,719
that are you know pretty much hitting

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,079
every industry

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,960
um

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,520
it's good to put it in context as to

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,799
exactly what is to gain i guess from the

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,119
cyber uh from the cyber crimes that are

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,479
out there uh in terms of cyber damage

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,440
cost

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,200
you know we're looking at

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
six trillion dollars in 2021 uh

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,160
potentially exceeding 10.5 trillion by

64
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,720
2025

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
and uh as well we see the investments in

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
cyber cyber security also increasing uh

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,640
actually substantially from 3.5 billion

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,599
in 2014 and then cumulatively going to

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,400
about a trillion dollars between 2017

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
and 2025. now i put these sides aside

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
just to

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
compare the growth in both the

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
investments and the damage

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,760
not so much a statement on how much

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,560
should be invested to match the actual

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
damage that are out there

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,760
but we do know that more is needed and

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,160
faster

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,560
so let's put the supply chain in context

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
we hear i mean so the supply chain in

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
context to me covers three areas

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,599
software development

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,120
software deployment

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
and software runtime so we start with

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
the software development side uh

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
to me the supply chain and everything

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,680
that goes into it has to account for not

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
only where the code is actually being

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
developed when it's where it's being

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,440
checked in who's checking it in you know

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,080
are these verifiable sources are these

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,879
repos healthy you know there's a big a

93
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,239
big part of sorry one

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,239
yeah so there's a lot there's a lot that

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,319
goes just to making sure that the code

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,319
is authentic and the integrity of the

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
code itself

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,319
and that spans the software and the

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,319
underlying hardware of that development

100
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,360
environment

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
and then when we

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
when we move forward to the deployment

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
phase

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,959
now we have to make sure that we know

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,799
what we're getting is healthy we know

106
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,280
that we can verify the sources both of

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
the repositories and the issuers of the

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
of whatever claims you know that's where

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
we look at the s bombs that are being

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
generated we want to make sure that

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,799
those s bombs are generated at check-in

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,799
time and not after

113
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
after the build is complete

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
you know and we want to know that we're

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,199
actually using hardened deployment

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,798
processes especially when you're

117
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,120
deploying at the edge or you know

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
in a sovereign environment you may not

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
actually have direct access direct

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,800
control over the infrastructure that's

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
being deployed so you want to make sure

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,639
that your your processes are hardened

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
both in the software side and also in

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
the infrastructure deployment

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,639
and then once you're running this

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
environment and running the software you

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,880
know you're going to have drift right

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,240
unless you're investing heavily in the

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,080
automation and all the tooling that can

130
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
guarantee that

131
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
drift doesn't happen you know you want

132
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
to you you want that monitoring you want

133
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,120
you want that observability you know do

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,479
you have those hardened package

135
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,560
management tools that will get you the

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,040
the right updates the secure updates you

137
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
know um if you're if you've got your

138
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,479
your infrastructure team the operations

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
team actually doing break fix on those

140
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
environments on that infrastructure are

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,720
they producing signed scripts right

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,080
that's something that we learned as part

143
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
of deploying uh

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,759
cloud on-prem is how do you seal the box

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,840
and everything that our sres have to do

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
on those systems can actually be from a

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
trusted source in this case being

148
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
microsoft but the customer gets the

149
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,919
guarantee as well that whatever's being

150
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,639
put on their systems to initiate a break

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
fix is actually uh verified right so

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
this the supply chain primarily you know

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
we talk a lot about the software

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,240
development side but it does span um all

155
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,400
the way into the runtime all you know

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,840
through the updates and eventually into

157
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,520
decommissioning right we put a lot of

158
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
work especially in hyperscale cloud uh

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
service providers on the secure

160
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
destruction of data to ensure that

161
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,639
nothing actually leaks out of the

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,520
out of the data center

163
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,039
okay

164
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,000
so

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
let's get to the first myth

166
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
once you create your s-bomb you're

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
pretty much done right

168
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,880
well let's uh first question is what are

169
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
you describing right we talk a lot about

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
describing the dependencies the binaries

171
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
the docker image with images whatever

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,080
you want to or the container images you

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,759
can start there but

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,759
that quickly starts if you start peeling

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,600
that onion or pulling that thread you

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,639
know you're going to start asking more

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
questions right you know is it beyond

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,039
the entire package at what granularity

179
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,039
what are your upstream dependencies you

180
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,479
know what are you expecting to see in

181
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
that metadata you know uh do you have

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
any kind of uh vulnerability

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
information captured inside you know do

184
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,919
you have your cv scan results also in

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,600
there and there's a bunch of tools that

186
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
come along with that right not only with

187
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
s-bomb and the formats whether it's

188
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,599
cyclone dx spdx um ava black covered git

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
bomb earlier today you know but then you

190
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,599
get into uh the

191
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,680
signing of those statements and what it

192
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
actually means to be a verifiable

193
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
statement

194
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,919
and then the automation right the

195
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,880
frameworks like in total and tough tough

196
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
giving you those uh sealed updates and

197
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
eventually the observability side right

198
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,039
how do you get to the you know multiple

199
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,840
levels of of a secure environment and

200
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,759
the promises that you've gone through

201
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,280
each of those steps and you know met

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,880
those requirements and that's where

203
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
something like salsa comes in so

204
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
i like to use

205
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
i like to you know start with the fact

206
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,039
that s palms are typically used as an

207
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
ingredients list or the comparison that

208
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
it's the ingredients list to something

209
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,400
that you buy in the store or maybe you

210
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
get something on the menu but i want to

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
pull that thread a little bit more and i

212
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
want to use

213
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
an example

214
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
that is

215
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
from a show called portlandia

216
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,280
you know um and in basically two minutes

217
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,160
of

218
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
a couple entering a store they ask about

219
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
the chicken that's on the menu

220
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
and they you know they learn a lot of

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,199
great things like you know the chicken's

222
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,759
name is colin uh you know it's breed and

223
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,440
you know what it was fed

224
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
uh but then they start asking you know

225
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
they start pulling the thread more you

226
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
know um is it happy did it have friends

227
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
you know uh is it is the information

228
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,759
that's being provided actually you know

229
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,720
real

230
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,440
um is it organic right does it meet

231
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,960
whatever requirements of organic what

232
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,440
kind of organic you know and eventually

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
you know where did it grow up

234
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
you know who who owns that farm

235
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,199
you know and

236
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,639
the person is actually providing this

237
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,000
information that service provider in

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
that case

239
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,080
it's not an authoritative source

240
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
whatever they're saying you know could

241
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
be true you can't verify you don't know

242
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
if it's authentic they're just trying to

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
do their the best that they can to the

244
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
best of their abilities

245
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,279
so

246
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,799
in the same way if you looked at a

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
lettuce right you've got dna markers

248
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
embedded into the lettuce itself that if

249
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
you need to trace back a parasite

250
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
outbreak or any kind of bacterial

251
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,120
outbreak you know what farm that lettuce

252
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
came from so i like those kind of

253
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,839
examples because

254
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
it gets sorry

255
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,240
it gets us you know thinking more about

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
what else could we include as part of

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
that s-bomb and what other artifacts we

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,399
want to include right when we say

259
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,519
artifacts

260
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,959
sorry when i say artifacts in this

261
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,720
discussion i'm going beyond just the

262
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,279
nest palm the document but any kind of

263
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,720
for example measurements that are being

264
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,839
done on the on the code itself

265
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,200
you know any kind of logs that need to

266
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
be uh added or even a manual attestation

267
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
right of maybe some stl process that

268
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,560
isn't automated that you but you want to

269
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,920
make sure that it's captured and signed

270
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
by someone within the organization right

271
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
so

272
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,519
um

273
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,600
all right so then we get to the second

274
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
half of that myth which is you know once

275
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,200
you create the s bomb and you've got

276
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
your software captured you know you're

277
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
pretty much done and in fact what we're

278
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,560
seeing and you know some of the

279
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
investments that we're making actually

280
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
we want to extend the build of materials

281
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,959
concept and that artifact gathering and

282
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,279
verification concept uh beyond the

283
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
software into the underlying hardware so

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560
you can see for example uh these the

285
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
chip manufacturing industry

286
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,959
highly automated huge investments in

287
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,680
these in these uh in fabrication you

288
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,079
know and you know they've got they've

289
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
got all of this nailed down but they're

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
really siloed because of that ip that

291
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
they carry within those within those

292
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,839
fabs and so you know you really can't

293
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,920
make any determination on the qual on

294
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720
the um on the chips itself you know you

295
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,079
just have to trust that it's being done

296
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
right and what we've seen it recently

297
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,600
with nvidia is that anyone is

298
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
susceptible to these kind of threats um

299
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,600
if you look at system integration right

300
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
once those chips leave the fabs they get

301
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
sent to these odms you know and

302
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
eventually they get put into systems by

303
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,839
a system integrator you know that's

304
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
another level of building materials

305
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,079
right if you're in procurement you know

306
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,480
that anytime you order a server you're

307
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,079
giving that building materials to you

308
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
know your hardware vendor and you want

309
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
to make sure that what you get back is

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
actually that server and that it's

311
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,680
something that uh ideally isn't you know

312
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
tampered with especially if you're going

313
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,519
to a secure environment or in in the

314
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
federal space

315
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,399
um

316
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,560
so

317
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,920
two sides to that myth about you know

318
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
just being at one s palm and you're done

319
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
both on when you're pulling the onion on

320
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,279
the fractal of dependencies as ava put

321
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,920
it earlier today and also how deep into

322
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,079
the stack do you actually go beyond just

323
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
describing the software

324
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
so

325
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,320
uh the next question is you know you've

326
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
got the s-bomb and that's it you can be

327
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,079
trusted right this is a really simple

328
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,120
one um swamps can be modified all right

329
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
and uh it's you know the metadata that's

330
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
contained there there's really no way of

331
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,680
proving uh you know who generated it and

332
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,519
if it's something if it's an authentic

333
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,839
uh piece of documentation and if even if

334
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,920
it's verifiable so this is where we get

335
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,320
into you know if you pull on the collin

336
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,040
example right a farmer could say all

337
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,800
right um colin right grew up on contoso

338
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,560
farms and i'm signing that statement

339
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
that's a statement that i'm making about

340
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
this particular product so you get into

341
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
you know two you know the salsa example

342
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
where in this case we're talking about

343
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
attestations right where you take that

344
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
the artifact itself is the document or

345
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
the log or something else but now you're

346
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
making a statement making a statement

347
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
about that particular artifact and then

348
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,160
you want to make sure that it's signed

349
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
and you want to make sure that it's

350
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
something that's verifiable right and so

351
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,160
you get both the you know you put it in

352
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,440
the envelope and then you've got those

353
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
bundles of attestations that actually

354
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
describe your microservice your service

355
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,839
your product you know whatever whatever

356
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,360
you're trying to describe

357
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
in your environment okay

358
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
so this gets us to you know uh if it can

359
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,560
be trusted and also the integrity

360
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,760
so uh skit is actually a framework in an

361
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,320
architecture uh that has been worked on

362
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
in in

363
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
in the open community where we're

364
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
looking at how to enhance the security

365
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,160
of the ledgers themselves so ledgers

366
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,680
that you've heard on today we're talking

367
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
about you know append only

368
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
append only ledgers that are tamper

369
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,200
proof built on merkle trees all goodness

370
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
um what we've done with skit is actually

371
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
take that a step further and we give you

372
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,399
three guarantees uh both in uh when it

373
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
comes to encryption encryption on disk

374
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
encryption in transit and encryption in

375
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,880
use and this is where we get to the

376
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,079
conversation about on secure enclaves so

377
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
on the skid side and the skit service

378
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,240
there's essentially three guarantees

379
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
that the service itself is making the

380
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,959
first one is that the statements are

381
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,639
issued

382
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,279
you know by someone that's identifiable

383
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
that's authentic and though no taxi

384
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,279
backs is right you can't say yeah i

385
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
didn't say that so you're non-reputable

386
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,079
right and then the next step is to say

387
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,560
that those statements get registered on

388
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,279
a secure ledger that's immutable right

389
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,279
and that's secure from from top to

390
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,920
bottom okay

391
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,399
and the next one is that

392
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,320
the

393
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,320
issuers

394
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
that's right so the issuers can prove to

395
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
any other party that those claims

396
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,639
actually exist in that ledger with a

397
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,800
receipt once you have that receipt and

398
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
you actually have that you know the

399
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,399
combination receipt and the claim you

400
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,560
know that it was recorded in the ledger

401
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
and that you can actually trust what's

402
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,880
actually being uh put out there

403
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,279
now this architecture is actually built

404
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,800
on um confidential computing so in azure

405
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
the confidential computing vms

406
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,120
running intel sgx

407
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
offer that secure enclave and that's

408
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
what that's a technology that gives you

409
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
that

410
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,959
guarantees at the chip level that the

411
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
memory space the data is actually

412
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
protected while in use so there's no

413
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,360
chance of tampering while the data is

414
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
being written to the ledger itself

415
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,880
okay so let's quickly walk through the

416
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,639
architecture and just uh you know a

417
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,079
simple workflow

418
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,160
first we start with who right so we

419
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,480
start with the with the did uh the

420
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
decentralized identity once we have that

421
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,000
identity um captured the next step we

422
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,880
actually

423
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
can then generate our artifacts s bombs

424
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
logs whatever it is and so once i have

425
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,279
that that artifact next thing i want to

426
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,199
do is generate a statement right this is

427
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
what i'm saying about this artifact

428
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,800
which is what what i eventually want to

429
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,639
wrap into into the next step which is um

430
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,760
sorry

431
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,360
so which i'm eventually going to wrap

432
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
into a claim now i get my endorsement

433
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
from the did based on my uh my on the

434
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,279
identity

435
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,079
and i can use that to generate a claim

436
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
now the claim itself is what you know

437
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
wrapped in a cozy envelope which

438
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,399
includes protected headers the payload

439
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,320
itself which is the statement and the

440
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
signature that comes from your uh your

441
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
did

442
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
so now with that claim in hand

443
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
uh what i can do is now record it in a

444
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,959
ledger so the skit

445
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
skate architecture provides a skit

446
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
service provides a transparency service

447
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
that transparency service is the one

448
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,839
that records it in the ledger once it's

449
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,440
recorded in a ledger what you actually

450
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,399
get back is a counter sign statement

451
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
that sorry counter signature that we

452
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
call a receipt

453
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
okay so

454
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
once with the original claim in hand and

455
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
a receipt now you have a transparent

456
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,759
claim and the the

457
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
the beauty about this uh part of the

458
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
system is that now you can use that

459
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
transparent claim to actually verify all

460
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,639
the information that was put into the

461
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
ledger itself because you have a receipt

462
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,120
of that that the data was actually

463
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
written to

464
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,959
into the service uh the the transparent

465
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,880
service itself will guarantee that a

466
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
receipt is not given until the date is

467
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,800
written right so

468
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
if you have a receipt data has been

469
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
written and now you can uh whether it's

470
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,480
yourself as part of verifying in you

471
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,279
know in uh in real time or let's say an

472
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,199
auditor needs to go in and you know

473
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
basically run through all the

474
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,279
verification um for an investigation or

475
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,880
something else they can use those

476
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,399
transparent claims which is a claim in

477
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,880
the receipt against the ledger to walk

478
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
through all the

479
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,839
um

480
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,039
everything that they need to verify

481
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,880
all right

482
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,600
give me one second

483
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
okay

484
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,359
so the next one is okay so you've

485
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,599
generated the s-bomb and we saw a lot of

486
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,039
this as well as we were going through

487
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
the the executive order and making sure

488
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,280
that we you know we we met uh all the

489
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,960
requirements there you know a lot of the

490
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,280
folks that are actually doing this work

491
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,640
they don't know the details that go

492
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,880
behind what's you know uh what's

493
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,120
actually going into the guarantees that

494
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,640
you don't you want to make whether it's

495
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,280
you know the sdl guarantees or the s

496
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
bomb and everything else so

497
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,559
just saying that yeah i did x checkbox

498
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,559
done uh we know that that's not enough

499
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,799
being compliant uh you know is not a way

500
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,440
of gain of getting to be secure

501
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
um simple example is what happened at

502
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,640
target in 2013 pci dss compliant yet

503
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,520
they still got hacked a few weeks later

504
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,039
and even though they earned that

505
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,320
certificate that said that they were

506
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,600
compliant so this is where we get into

507
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
you know um

508
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,200
think uh

509
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
a way of looking at the executive order

510
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,039
that actually has

511
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,640
multiple parts that actually can

512
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
contribute to it first you're looking at

513
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,760
the uh

514
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
secure software development framework

515
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,640
the ssdf right and then from there the

516
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,320
supply chain risk management document

517
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
and also zero trust architecture

518
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
and gives you a way of mapping from the

519
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
eo

520
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,919
and through what the requirements are

521
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,919
you know the recommendations are into

522
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,960
actual practices and tasks that can be

523
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,200
done to meet those requirements and the

524
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
beauty about this system is that it it's

525
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
really not meant to be

526
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,679
fire and forget or one and done right

527
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,679
you do it and you want you want it to be

528
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,679
continuous you want to keep building

529
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,679
those practices so that

530
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,120
you know this becomes

531
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,799
inherent in what you do on day to day

532
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,679
you shift left in terms of of your test

533
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
environment and you start

534
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,440
these security practices from the

535
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
beginning

536
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
and

537
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,799
lastly

538
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,480
with willpower alone you can push

539
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
through those tough days i'm gonna get a

540
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
little bit more personal here but you

541
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,480
know uh between long hours you know

542
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,840
keeping up with with the increased

543
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
threats uh coming into your environment

544
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
you know there's a

545
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
winding skill gap that's been seen as

546
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
well in terms of cancellations being uh

547
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
cancellation of events you know the the

548
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
onset the pandemic you know and then

549
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
just the relentless security reviews and

550
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,799
audits and everything else uh we know

551
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,919
that there's eventually going to be

552
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,520
burnout right so

553
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
part of that you know is asking for help

554
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
and that's you know something that does

555
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
require a certain level of vulnerability

556
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,440
but it's something that you know once

557
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
you have that network of support around

558
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
you you know it's something that can

559
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
help you through those tough days you

560
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
know setting healthy boundaries at work

561
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,880
as well uh sometimes

562
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,600
it's not easy you know current a recent

563
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,679
survey that was done uh measuring that

564
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,280
about 47 of security uh admins and

565
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
operations folks you know working over

566
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,600
40 hours a week up into the 90 hour

567
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,240
range so um and

568
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
with the

569
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,919
cyber damages and the incentive that

570
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,080
these guys have that these folks have to

571
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
actually do this you know to actually do

572
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,000
uh damage into an environment you know

573
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
that threat is just going to continue to

574
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
increase you know and also just

575
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
understanding you know what you need to

576
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,360
do to recover whether even a micro dose

577
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,320
of recovery and obviously sleep as well

578
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
so with that i've got a few resources

579
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,960
that i've added into the deck itself

580
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,120
and that you can check off a check up

581
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,720
offline and that is it so i thank you

582
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
for your time thank you for your

583
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,679
attention and

584
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,360
open to any questions as well if you

585
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,080
haven't

586
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,720
okay thank you

587
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,039
any questions

588
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,039
so i have one question so how does this

589
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,159
align with the six store right so the

590
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,280
framework that you mentioned the

591
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
architecture uh so

592
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,760
do you see any synergies there

593
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,559
uh as of right now it's they're separate

594
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,880
but it's something that we need to also

595
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,039
look at and investigate uh because there

596
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,159
are some similarities there when it

597
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
comes to having a ledger and ensuring

598
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,679
that you've got you know your your

599
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,000
trusted your root of trust uh but as of

600
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,280
right now those are those two are

601
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
separate

602
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,880
any other question

603
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,559
yeah thanks thanks victor thank you very

604
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
much everyone appreciate it
