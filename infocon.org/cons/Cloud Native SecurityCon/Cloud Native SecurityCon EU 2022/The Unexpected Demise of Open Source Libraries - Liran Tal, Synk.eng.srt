1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
so you know those open source libraries

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,240
well

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,759
that kind of disappeared a little bit um

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
so we're going to be talking about the

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,679
unexpected demise of open source

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,759
libraries or it's going to disappear and

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,880
we're not going to be talking about

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,599
anything i don't know um so next up we

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,279
have laryntal

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,199
again

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,520
so i'm probably gonna be the only person

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,680
who's stopping you and the

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,480
after party up happy hour thing so no

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,920
pressure there

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
uh so yeah the unexpected demise of open

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,320
source libraries or basically where do

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
the where do libraries go to die or

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
libraries die hard all of those kind of

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,760
titles of you know us using open source

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
projects but maybe not knowing exactly

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
what's happening there

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
so open source has fundamentally changed

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,640
my life

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,520
as a teenager for me i was going onto

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,960
things like the linux kernel mailing

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
list hanging out with people learning

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
about open source using tools

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
basically finding collaboration and

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
communication paths with like-minded

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,160
people

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,920
and it enabled me to learn and do many

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
many good things i hope and just put

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
them out there one of those was the

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,400
projects that i actually built about 15

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,439
years ago uploaded it to an open source

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
page called sourceforge for some of you

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
who might remember it

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,119
and you know to date i've actually went

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
back and seen how much uh that has

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,880
actually been impactful and i've

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
actually seen this project called uh

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,799
dela radios as part of

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,040
the resume of some people that have

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
their skills and exp and experience laid

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
out on linkedin which is pretty cool so

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,000
it actually changed my life but it also

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
allowed me and enabled me to

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,479
basically improve and change others

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,560
people's life to the better so i'm glad

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
for open source my name is irantal i'm a

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,479
developer advocate at sneak where we

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,880
build developer first security tools

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,799
basically help empower developers to not

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
just find but fix security issues along

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
the way id is sexy and all of those

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
things i'm also doing a bunch of stuff

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,640
on the ecosystems of node.js and pm

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
open source all around so if you have

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
any questions on this in any different

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,640
way i'm happy to chat about it

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
afterwards just find me here

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,758
so talking about open source um this is

63
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,760
this is a pretty interesting topic and

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
the success of it i think i think it's

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
been successful so far so i went back

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,959
and found some information that was

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,040
really interesting for me one of which

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
was

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,239
almost half of the projects at around

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,120
nine at 20 15 on github are mit licensed

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,360
which is interesting by itself but

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,599
actually this is all the projects

73
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,680
everything else if we look down

74
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
specifically on things like ecosystem

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
language-based ecosystems like npm like

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
ruby python pybi things that people

77
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
store there we're actually getting to

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,280
about 90

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,959
of those projects

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,360
being used using licenses that are very

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
very permissive

82
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
and i think that is something that has

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
indeed contributed to the fact that open

84
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
source has really

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,720
been growing and advancing at a really

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,879
increased state

87
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,239
so

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,599
one question when we're talking about

89
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,280
here and you know the unexpected demise

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
of open source libraries is are we have

91
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
we used

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
so much open source that at this point

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,599
we're actually taking it for granted

94
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,720
and then

95
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
what happens when we do what happens

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
when we use open source and just consume

97
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
it it's just you know

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,959
just another s-bomb entry

99
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,280
so with that said i want to share with

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
you a few stories that really happened

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,799
in the ecosystems this one specifically

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,440
called left pad is a story of how legal

103
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
actions were driven and taken by

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,239
commercial body towards an open source

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,799
maintainer that at the end of it back in

106
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,319
2016

107
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,480
the end of this action it had actually

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,440
caused

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
widespread disruption of build and

110
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,120
systems

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
impacting projects like the node.js

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
project like babel and other in the

113
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
javascript ecosystem so what exactly

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,319
happened there

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,680
well if we take for example uh you know

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
regular software development theme like

117
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
this one well there are some fallacies

118
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,200
there for example we have uh murray

119
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
jonathan and mina doing open source

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
development which is great and they're

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
doing also internal development

122
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
for the company and you know it's been

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,160
scientifically proved that to be a

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
developer and what it actually means is

125
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,320
essentially you take some coffee

126
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
that's right you know it and some code

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,680
goes out

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
and so that it you know about this one

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
already uh there's another thing that

130
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
has been uh we've been witnessing

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
recently and that is that no they use a

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
lot of open source packages up to 90

133
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
and you know those statistics being

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
shared out you know once uh and about

135
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
every time and they use a lot of those

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
open source packages one of them by the

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
way is this person called azure he's an

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,960
open source developer a maintainer of

139
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
many many modules one of them this team

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,400
actually uses so in essence

141
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
one of the fallacies is this team is not

142
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,680
really three people team they're like a

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
four people team actually many many more

144
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
people because we're using a lot of open

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
source packages behind those projects

146
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
behind those packages leave other

147
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,800
maintainers and other developers that

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
impact us

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,479
so let's talk about azure for a second

150
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
azure has is an npm developer you know

151
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
building stuff upon the npm registry for

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
javascript he has this module called

153
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
kick kik

154
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,479
which accidentally

155
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
is also a name of an instant messaging

156
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
application

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
that's pender and a commercial entity

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,639
that exists

159
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
on this kind of like a platform

160
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,680
and so he was asked by this legal entity

161
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
you know several emails exchange and so

162
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
on to basically give up the name and

163
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
reduce some other name just you know

164
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
give it up and uh and allow this other

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
company uses kik to own that actual name

166
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
that didn't really work out as you know

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
could have guessed so as a protest of uh

168
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
no not really agreeing with that then

169
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
npm the registry itself the team behind

170
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,639
it not able to actually bridge between

171
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,280
the two sides and eventually uh what

172
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,600
happened is he did not want to

173
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
get a lawsuit or any other kind of like

174
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,319
legal actions so went on and just as a

175
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,759
protest action

176
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,400
removed all of his modules from npm he

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,039
had many of them about 250 back then

178
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,639
just removed removed

179
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
any all of them and said you know bye

180
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
bye

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
one little thing that happened there is

182
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
there's like this little little model 17

183
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
lines of code called left pad left

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
padding strings

185
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,759
and it's downloaded just a little bit

186
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
about 2.5 million times and so when that

187
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,319
got removed

188
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,560
essentially a lot of projects that used

189
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,039
it as a nested dependency somewhere down

190
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,120
your transitive dependency tree have

191
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,039
actually broken up

192
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,039
and this is how

193
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,639
this story became to be how one

194
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,240
developer actually broke the whole

195
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
ecosystem

196
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,800
so some learnings from this story

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
first of all reinstalling those packages

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
all the time when you do npm install on

199
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
ci on developer machines and you go off

200
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
and fetch

201
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,000
you know the actual the actual artifact

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
like this kick module or

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,919
left pad module or something else you

204
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,000
want this to be a very deterministic and

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,560
you know proven uh way of doing that so

206
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
obviously one of the ways of doing this

207
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
is to put something like a caching proxy

208
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
like uh something that actually takes uh

209
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
both the fact that it also saves up not

210
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,319
just the fact that something could be

211
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,400
a network error or just be gone from the

212
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,479
registry for some reasons but also the

213
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,000
fact that you want to speed things up

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,080
and do those kind of installs really

215
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
fast internally so verdejo is an open

216
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,599
source

217
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
private proxy server that does all of

218
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,599
those kind of things it's pretty fast

219
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,280
basically the way that it works you kind

220
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
of configure package managers to use

221
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
that as the app stream or as the actual

222
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,680
registry and then that one is verda

223
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
itself is used as that

224
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
a source to which upstream are you

225
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
allowed to actually contact and bring

226
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
all of these things in so reduction is

227
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
really cool and it's a great open source

228
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
software for us to do this and i think a

229
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
lot of companies have learned this in

230
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
the hard way of using those internal

231
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
proxies

232
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,240
not just for speeding up reasons but

233
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
actually to prevent those cases from

234
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
happening but also the fact that

235
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,720
when this happened when all modules got

236
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
published this was an unprecedented

237
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,199
event in the npm ecosystem because no

238
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,759
one thought about the potential you know

239
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,280
threat attack that someone would

240
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
actually go and publish their modules

241
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,080
especially if they're so popular and

242
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,919
everyone use them but when they do it

243
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,840
just impacts everyone else so it

244
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,039
actually brought in npm to introduce new

245
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,759
limitations as if you cannot

246
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,639
unpublish your modules if it is popular

247
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
or used by other you know dependencies

248
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
and so on and so on so we've learned

249
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
from it as an ecosystem as well but

250
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
we've had to learn the hard way

251
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
another story is

252
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,440
this uh story about someone

253
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,800
who actually stopped their project from

254
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,320
being alive from being maintained

255
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
anymore just because they wanted

256
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,440
to be a bit more greener for the earth

257
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
so i don't know how you would feel about

258
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
it but i'm pretty sure like for a lot of

259
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
maintainers like gaining the popularity

260
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,120
and reputation of being an open using an

261
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
open source project is something they

262
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
probably don't want to cut in uh just

263
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,959
midway or as you're developing it but

264
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
for this person not so much

265
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,519
so meet francois he's the developer and

266
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,839
maintainer of this faker php library

267
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,360
it's essentially a library that allows

268
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
you to fake data do random generation of

269
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
data for tests things like that

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
it's pretty cool it's been there for

271
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,240
since 2011 and it has been used uh to to

272
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
be uh

273
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
an sdk for like different languages like

274
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
uh python and uh also provide different

275
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
locales like over 70k so it's like a

276
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
very very popular project

277
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,360
when you download it as a dev tool it's

278
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
three megabytes of size pretty you know

279
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,240
not that much if you compare it to like

280
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,760
end-to-end tools and like figure things

281
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,920
that you probably pull in

282
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
so this is a project it became so

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
popular that by 2019 it had actually

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
been downloaded over 120 million times

285
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,680
many many contributors many many

286
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
projects being dependent on it but the

287
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
thing is

288
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
at this point of popularity if something

289
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,800
if you wanted to be

290
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
conscious of climate change would you

291
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
actually consider the size of your

292
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
library an issue

293
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
sure maybe it's an issue for front-end

294
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,160
and optimization and stuff like that but

295
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
for climate change that is something

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,040
that francois really had difficulties

297
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
agreeing with and working with he did

298
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,360
not want to be a person who contributes

299
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
in a bad way to climate change

300
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
and he actually you know figured out

301
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,040
that potentially what's going on there

302
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,839
is about 11 metric tons of co2 emissions

303
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,760
just by all of those downloads that's a

304
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
lot and he said i do not want to do this

305
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,480
anymore

306
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,760
so what happens next well first of all

307
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
do we get new maintainers how does open

308
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,120
source work

309
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,839
so francois had here's as you've seen

310
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,600
and understood like he's been on the

311
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
open source ecosystem for a bit and he

312
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,279
had like really bad experience with

313
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
transitioning his projects to other

314
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,320
maintainers uh one of his stories is he

315
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,399
actually uh owned another maintain

316
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,560
another project called propel a php or

317
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,600
rm library and when he handed that off

318
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,320
to a friend to continue maintaining it

319
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
that friend

320
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
handed it off to another friend

321
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
which handed it off to another friend

322
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
which they ended up to another friend

323
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,720
that said this code base is not really

324
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,800
good i'm gonna rewrite this whole thing

325
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,519
and do a 2.0 version that was six years

326
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,680
ago nothing came out of it

327
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,560
so

328
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
he had a really bad experience and he

329
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
did not want to just you know try to

330
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,079
continue the project by handing it off

331
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,440
so he said

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
i'm archiving the project archiving the

333
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,279
github you know repository no more

334
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,600
releases no more issues nothing else if

335
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
you want you can fork it

336
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,839
you know he just added a comment

337
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,440
you can fork it it might be better than

338
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
faker the php library just remember it

339
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
might not be so much fun

340
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
so here's another open source dependency

341
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,160
just unexpectedly you know dying off

342
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
first of all excruciating maintainers i

343
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,480
think is a is a really good thing that

344
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
we should adopt and that relates to the

345
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
whole sustainability aspect of open

346
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
source and discussions around this and

347
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,920
of course you know help support the

348
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
climate change is an important thing and

349
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,560
it's great that maintainers and

350
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,920
developers are conscious to this

351
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
our last story is about how

352
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
mr m this person did not want to do any

353
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
more free work as part of their open

354
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
source packages

355
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,800
and i'm pretty sure there's some people

356
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,160
here that are contributing to open

357
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
source maybe even maintaining it so

358
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
we're all using open source projects but

359
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
how much are we actually giving back to

360
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
people how much are we actually giving

361
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,959
back to the projects maintainers

362
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,200
themselves and developers

363
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
i promise that unlike their two stories

364
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
i'll

365
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,959
end this fairy tale one in a positive

366
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
note

367
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
so meet mr m

368
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
they are an open source maintainer

369
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
and they have a bunch of projects one of

370
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,200
them is this called faker.js this is by

371
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,360
the way not the same project the idea is

372
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,639
the same but

373
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
coincidentally uh it is

374
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
it is of the same name just not the same

375
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,920
one different maintainers different

376
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
projects by the way different outcomes

377
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
it's pretty popular as well this one as

378
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
well is used to generate random data

379
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,639
used for tests and things like that but

380
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,839
um

381
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
it is pretty popular as well 12 million

382
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
million monthly downloads and

383
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
just like many other projects on the

384
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
ecosystem most of this work is unfunded

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,560
it's maybe sustainable maybe not but you

386
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,399
know no one contributes to the project

387
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,720
so this person the maintainer behind a

388
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
project called faker.js

389
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
went down on 20 uh 2020 and said uh in a

390
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,760
github issue i am not going to support

391
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,240
this project or you anymore uh no more

392
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
free work from me

393
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
and i think as you can see maybe a bit

394
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,399
by the reactions on github most of the

395
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,760
people actually agree with this and

396
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
support this because it's a project

397
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
that's used by you know fortune 500

398
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,480
companies and you know we're not that

399
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
doing that well of a job contributing

400
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
back to all the peers and the colleagues

401
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,360
that actually work on open source

402
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
so this was his statement and the

403
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
question is was this heard this was back

404
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
2020

405
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,959
it wasn't that hard

406
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,040
one of those things that happened is

407
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,720
that by 2022 the beginning of january

408
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
this person the maintainer actually

409
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
pushed code into the repository that

410
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,199
essentially nullified everything else

411
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,040
they forced push a commit so all the

412
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
source code that existed for this faker

413
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,760
js php library was completely removed

414
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,639
only

415
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,399
if you archived it or forked it before

416
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,800
or clone it or whatever nothing exists

417
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
also they pushed a new version called

418
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
faker

419
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,959
6.6.6 understand that where this is

420
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
going which indeed broke the ecosystem

421
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,480
as well it had nothing in it but

422
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
essentially it was an empty project if

423
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,880
you try to use it it would fake it would

424
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
uh it would not work and so

425
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,199
he actually lived up to his statement

426
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,079
right

427
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,680
said no more free work so no more free

428
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,880
work you're not getting any of those

429
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
packages anymore question is did anyone

430
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
really care to understand that we

431
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,880
actually need to dive a bit deeper into

432
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
what happened here and so

433
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,760
faker this project if if the maintainer

434
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,279
actually pushes the project with you

435
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,560
know 6.6.6 major version

436
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,639
that is broken but is this actually

437
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,199
affecting all of us not exactly

438
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,160
the main

439
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
stable branch or version center range of

440
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
faker the library on npm is actually

441
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,720
major version 5. the way that npm works

442
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
behind the scenes is where usually it

443
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
out of fetches

444
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,800
minor and patch versions depending on

445
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
how you configure things

446
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
but you have to be very explicit to just

447
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
take everything in with a wild card and

448
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
people usually do not do that and you

449
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
know

450
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
good thing that they don't so the fact

451
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,839
that a new version 6.6 is published

452
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,759
doesn't really impact many many people

453
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
because the amount of people actually

454
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,759
use faker as a new project or

455
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,600
automatically get it by builds isn't

456
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
that big

457
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
so something like this wasn't really

458
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,360
hurting anybody even though we wanted to

459
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
make a statement as this open source

460
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
maintainer did

461
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,639
but here's a note

462
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,959
this person a maintainer on npm actually

463
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,600
owns many other libraries not just faker

464
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,079
for example callers is another important

465
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,440
and very uh

466
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,199
important to the ecosystems but also

467
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,839
very uh you know prolific one

468
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,880
and

469
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
it's so popular used by nasa

470
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
dependencies that it has over 100

471
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
million downloads a month

472
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,480
so

473
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,959
mr m actually owns both of them he's the

474
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,639
maintainer of both of those

475
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,320
so what would we do

476
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,920
perhaps

477
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,720
inject something into callers

478
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,519
if

479
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,120
1.4.0

480
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,199
is the latest stable version that gets

481
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,759
those 100 million downloads a month

482
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,279
if we release 1.4.1 for example a patch

483
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,480
version

484
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
probably a lot of automated download

485
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
tools will actually start getting this

486
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
and this is exactly what happened and

487
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,399
also developers at least in javascript

488
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,560
from what i've seen are very keen on

489
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
just getting the latest and bleeding

490
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
edge which is we'll leave it to the end

491
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,079
to talk about it but what's in 1.4.1 we

492
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,599
usually don't even look at a source code

493
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,039
to realize what we're getting we just

494
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,480
want to be at the bleeding edge want to

495
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,799
get the new features the new bugs

496
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,959
new bug fixes

497
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
well here's one of the changelogs

498
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,599
i'll uh

499
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,039
go ahead and

500
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,240
zoom in for for some of you

501
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,600
this is what was added in 1.4.1

502
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,840
i realized that many maybe not everyone

503
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
here are programmer but essentially by

504
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,559
the for loop and a case of minus of less

505
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,760
than infinity you can understand that

506
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,679
this is a denial of service

507
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,320
of a loop that once you include and use

508
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
callers 1.4.1 in your project the moment

509
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,320
that you do and this is getting used

510
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
essentially this is a denial of service

511
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,559
attack for anyone because nothing will

512
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,320
actually continue working

513
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
with your application especially node.js

514
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
being single threaded

515
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
and so on so this is what happened

516
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
now remember we talked about mary and

517
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
jonathan and mina at the beginning and

518
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,080
we said they are part of open source

519
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
ecosystems they are this is the fallacy

520
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,960
we do not understand but they are so

521
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,280
let's see how far this went out

522
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,600
well mary actually works at amazon and

523
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,280
she is working with aws cdk which got

524
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,039
impacted because it uses 1.4.1 so all of

525
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,600
the users who used amazon cdk have

526
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,240
actually had this problem coming in

527
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,919
remember mina he's actually working for

528
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,919
heroku's a cliff

529
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,640
essentially that also uses colors behind

530
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
the sin and if you were using that you

531
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
would be pulling in automatically

532
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
potentially this you know denial of

533
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,919
service attack to your application

534
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,600
how about jonathan he's working on jess

535
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
that's like that's like a test runner

536
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,440
for javascript very famous one built

537
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,840
from facebook or meta these days

538
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,440
so that's also been pulling in callers

539
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
and all of these projects and many many

540
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
more so we are very much part of open

541
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,039
source and we cannot deny it anymore and

542
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,320
all of those things are actually

543
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
impacting us so if something goes bad

544
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,440
there

545
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,760
regardless of security vulnerabilities

546
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
like projects dying or

547
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,919
something some some in some way getting

548
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
added some malicious code into them that

549
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
just is you know bad we are impacted by

550
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,200
this

551
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,520
let's see further out how impactful this

552
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
is so

553
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,559
as they later published

554
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,919
version 1.4.1 and version 1.4.2

555
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,280
you could see that really really

556
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,320
fast

557
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
okay in a matter of hours and days

558
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,640
the amount of downloads per each version

559
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
we're talking about

560
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,280
more than

561
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,840
500 000 half a million downloads within

562
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,600
a day or two these and 1.41 and 2 are

563
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
the impacted one so it shows you how

564
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
fast and how impactful this has been on

565
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,080
the ecosystem if you have been impacted

566
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
by

567
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
colors

568
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
well

569
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,200
let's talk about colors incident

570
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,799
learning what could we have done to have

571
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,720
prevented this well first of all if you

572
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
use a log file and don't just install

573
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,679
everything all the time then you have a

574
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
lot of assurances like you know a

575
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
checksum like a sha and all of those

576
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,600
other things but essentially it allows

577
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
you to not just get every install you

578
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
know new version december whatever that

579
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,320
just you know went out yesterday but

580
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
you're always getting deterministic

581
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,240
installs there are specific commands in

582
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,559
npm that you have to follow both nci and

583
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,559
your development environment to make

584
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,880
sure that indeed this is what happens

585
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
because you could still have a log file

586
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,000
but use different commands that override

587
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,039
it so like this is like a bad practice

588
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
the other thing is if that would have

589
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
happened to you and you wanted to

590
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
mitigate it

591
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,919
if this is a nested dependency not a

592
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,280
direct dependency which you can just

593
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,200
update if this is a nasa dependency

594
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
impacting you then you cannot really do

595
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
anything to change it if another

596
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,039
maintainer pulls in

597
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,720
for example just that pulls in colors

598
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,559
1.4.2 you cannot do anything to to tell

599
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,559
jess to do 1.41 until this feature from

600
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
npm now supported by other package

601
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
managers like yarn and and pnpm and that

602
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,679
allows you to specify this thing called

603
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,159
overrides which we used it also for as

604
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,360
you can see in the reference here for

605
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,679
the node ipc which is didn't cover it

606
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,039
here but that's like an another

607
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,919
interesting uh

608
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,600
protestor let's call it like that

609
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
so this is another way of doing that the

610
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,559
other thing that i actually want to

611
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,080
share with you is

612
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
there are many automated dependency

613
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
upgrade tools you know like the one you

614
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
use and see in github and there are

615
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,679
probably other vendors that do it the

616
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,080
thing is you have to be very conscious

617
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,840
on what you're updating we're just

618
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
talking about now about packages that

619
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
have been

620
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
harmed in or just stopped in one way or

621
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,559
the other but they made by the

622
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,320
maintainer that's not even like

623
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,880
an external attack vector someone taking

624
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,799
over a package that's like someone that

625
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,159
you're supposed to trust within the

626
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,360
ecosystem

627
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,320
and

628
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,840
all of those automated dependency

629
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
upgrade tools that you actually get all

630
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
the time updates and updates

631
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
think about for a second what if you

632
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,000
could have

633
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,559
been able to just delay the upgrade

634
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,240
right and so this is something that we

635
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,679
actually looked into

636
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,520
about three years ago back at snake when

637
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
i joined actually looked at many other

638
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
malicious incidents that happened and we

639
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,720
looked at the data frames for uh how how

640
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,880
much time it took for a malicious packet

641
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,600
to actually be known so now unless a

642
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,720
dependency is

643
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
needs to get a security fix like unless

644
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
this is a security fix that needs to go

645
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,159
in

646
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,520
all of those

647
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
updates that you will get from the sneak

648
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,440
bot for example will be delayed by about

649
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
three weeks which is what we found to be

650
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,520
a very reasonable time for you to update

651
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,960
you know just for

652
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,520
new features or new bug fixes if needed

653
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,960
automatically

654
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
but also be a bit on the safe side give

655
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
you some buffer time so you know the

656
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
community can vet it and things can you

657
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,120
know get uh

658
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,520
get uh worked out by a bunch of other

659
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,840
people and more more eyeballs looking at

660
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,880
it if the quote uh quote someone else

661
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,559
so i said this is going to be a

662
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,080
fairytale ending so what happened here

663
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
i'm going to go back not to callers but

664
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,640
to faker.js of the same maintainer

665
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,559
luckily for us faker.js on the

666
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
javascript system is a very big project

667
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,559
like we said many fortune 500 companies

668
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,880
have been using it so

669
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
the beauty of open source is that in the

670
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,440
case of faker.js here this maintainer of

671
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,919
colors and faker.js another group of

672
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,400
people amazing humans who came up and

673
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,919
said hey you know what we're going to

674
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,919
fork the project and it is very

675
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,200
influential there's like a lot to do

676
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
people use it all the time it's a very

677
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
good project and they have continued it

678
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,799
and provided the roadmap and everything

679
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,559
that they you know they updated the

680
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,559
documentation it actually brought a lot

681
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,440
of

682
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,039
different forks and different people who

683
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,559
maintain like documentation and stuff

684
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,559
like that aside brought them together so

685
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,240
they can actually cooperate on a new

686
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,640
place for faker js

687
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
so big shout out to this thing big shout

688
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
out to open source to everyone here is

689
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,679
doing that and to that team specifically

690
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,679
i wanted to take in uh just an example

691
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,520
of the metric this is from a screenshot

692
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
from yesterday you could see that from

693
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
just the last month the activity that

694
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,200
has been on the project has been to

695
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,640
close down merge 83 pull requests and

696
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
more and more so it's amazing to see

697
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,799
also the continuation of projects in the

698
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,200
open source ecosystem beyond them being

699
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,279
sometimes discontinued in ways that are

700
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,360
unexpected

701
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
so to end the kind like this the whole

702
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,559
stories here are going to give you a bit

703
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,919
more takeaways unrelated to these

704
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,679
specific stories

705
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,960
well first of all i think when

706
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,000
developers essentially look for packages

707
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
we use the currency of stars the

708
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,480
currency of downloads if i want to look

709
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,240
out for a package for example an http

710
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,360
library a client-side client library for

711
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
http calls i might go into you know a

712
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,559
place like npmjs and probably the one

713
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,120
thing that i'll use to judge is

714
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,279
how many downloads are there for it

715
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,720
actually it looks like this is a

716
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,520
trending up graph even so

717
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
looks like requests here this library

718
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,600
getting about 15 million downloads by

719
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
other users by our developers so i don't

720
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
know maybe it's safe maybe i'll use it

721
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,799
maybe but there are more

722
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,559
perspectives that we could look at

723
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,240
around the spectrum of what makes a

724
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,320
project what makes a community for a

725
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
project that are good indications that

726
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,600
we shouldn't

727
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,240
deny them so

728
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
on this one specifically request

729
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,799
actually got deprecated a few months

730
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,360
after this after this screenshot thing

731
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,080
so

732
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,159
what led to that is if we could have

733
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,919
looked at something that gave us more

734
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,880
information for example i open it up

735
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
retroactively now for example in the

736
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,240
sneak advisor tool which is a free tool

737
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,200
that you can use to like look at

738
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
packages and get more package health

739
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
information and you could see for

740
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,960
example we look at maintenance and we

741
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,279
see that it didn't have any commits or

742
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,760
any releases in the last two years so

743
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
yes it's getting downloaded 15 million

744
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
times but it's not really active that's

745
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
a signal that something could actually

746
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,919
turn bad it doesn't mean that it's bad

747
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,400
in internally or in any other way but

748
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,799
you probably do not want to continue new

749
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
greenfield projects and might want to

750
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,799
consider moving on to other http client

751
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,600
libraries on npm that are not this

752
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,279
let's take another example that's you

753
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,799
know the other side of the flip side of

754
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,120
the coin this is marked

755
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
a library a javascript library that

756
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,120
translates markdown and uh you know

757
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
converts that to html it's a pretty cool

758
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
library i've been on the system also for

759
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,480
a long time and it had its share of

760
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
vulnerabilities too but you could see

761
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,720
that many of the latest versions first

762
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,000
of all there are many of those

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,440
throughout 2021 and even though many

764
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,960
vulnerabilities are being tried to the

765
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,880
project they're getting fixed and your

766
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,200
releases are going out also you could

767
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,440
see the pulse on the com on the on the

768
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
maintenance side of things showing you

769
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
that commits are happening all the time

770
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,840
showing you an idea that again is not

771
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,360
bulletproof and doesn't mean that this

772
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,840
is you know not going to be discontinued

773
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,400
tomorrow but it's a good indication that

774
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,360
says this is a pretty positive

775
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,158
healthy project

776
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,679
whoever heard about this bomb

777
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,120
right

778
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
but i want to give you a different

779
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,640
perspective i want to lend a new

780
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,400
a new opinion here for you to like think

781
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,799
about here not just the software bill of

782
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,880
materials that's you know

783
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
fine like we talked about it a couple of

784
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
times that's that's okay

785
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,559
how about the fact that

786
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,120
projects are not materials they are

787
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,919
built by humans by people they are very

788
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,840
dynamic in nature they change they

789
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,480
evolve and so to think about humans as

790
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,440
materials is a pretty bad concept

791
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,720
i think

792
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,120
so how about we talk about sboh how

793
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,399
about we talk about the software bill of

794
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,399
health not just

795
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,799
what we use not just the vulnerabilities

796
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,200
of it but all those other signals that

797
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,399
we may have

798
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,159
in the project and around the project

799
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
and how it's actually being used and

800
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,720
consumed and does it have tests and so

801
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
many other kind of signals that we can

802
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,799
get into how healthy the project is as

803
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,240
an open source project for us to use

804
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
so hopefully some of this has resonated

805
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,320
with you i'm here for a bit uh thank you

806
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,840
for having me and you know use open

807
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,559
source safely it is great it's amazing

808
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,799
that's it

809
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
i wanted to end with a

810
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
bit of a bit of an ending here this is

811
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,840
the one

812
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,799
so

813
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,200
the only thing that lasts forever are

814
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,360
well naturally dependencies as we've

815
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,399
seen

816
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,640
and not really airmile so i hope you

817
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
used all of those when fine here and

818
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,000
covered in all those things

819
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,559
um i think it's cat videos on youtube

820
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,679
that's the only thing i could think of

821
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,279
that probably lasts forever

822
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,520
and so with that really thank you so

823
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,030
much and thank you for having me

824
00:28:52,030 --> 00:29:00,159
[Applause]

825
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,799
any questions

826
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,279
all right

827
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,360
eager for the happy hour

828
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,159
not there yet not yet okay cool well

829
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,840
have fun people and enjoy the conference
