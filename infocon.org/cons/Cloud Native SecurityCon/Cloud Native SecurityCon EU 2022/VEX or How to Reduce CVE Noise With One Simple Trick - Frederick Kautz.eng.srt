1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,760
the bank will have a different

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,199
relationship with me than i have with

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,240
with them

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,839
uh the third one as well is everything

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,160
is contextual so by context it's like

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,679
what is the environment what am i trying

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,559
to do

8
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,440
uh is it the right time to do so so i

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,719
want to just throw this out because this

10
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,000
is one of the best definitions i've seen

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,560
of trust for in quite a while and so i

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,400
want to draw this out just just to begin

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,279
with

14
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,279
now before we get started with it i want

15
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,199
to talk about a smaller

16
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,400
it's a bigger topic in a smaller setting

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,279
which is like why vex and

18
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,558
the why of this actually comes down to

19
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,120
economics so

20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,440
uh economics at the end of the day when

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
we tend one way of thinking of it is

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,600
this concept of risk and reward

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
so with risk and reward

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,160
like we get up in the morning we some of

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
us hop into cars there's risk there the

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
reward is that we get to go do things

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,480
that help us drive more income get to

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,559
see friends so there's a risk and reward

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,760
for each thing

30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
the same is true

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,399
if you are attacking a system there is a

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,920
risk

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,120
there is a reward of like what is a

34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,559
reward if i break into this thing like

35
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,920
maybe someone's going to mind bitcoin

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
maybe somebody is going to

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
try to break into

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
something to extract information out

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
maybe there's a reputation

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,040
part of it that they're looking towards

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,119
it there's a risk what is the risk of

42
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
being caught like is the risk they lose

43
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
access to the system is a risk that

44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,799
they're going to be contacted by their

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
by their local law enforcement

46
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,200
so what is that penalty

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
and there's also an opportunity cost so

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,920
the opportunity cost is i could spend

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,159
a week going after a hardened target

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,040
and when i maybe i could have made more

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,280
efforts to go after a squishier target

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
and get better results out of it in the

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
long run so there's also an opportunity

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
cost

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
even advanced persistent threats when we

56
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
say advanced persistent threats we

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
specifically mean well-funded groups

58
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
well-funded criminal organizations or

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,880
or governments

60
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,840
that have a large quantity of resources

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,920
large quantity of people but even they

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
have limited resources

63
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
any moment they are spending time on

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,560
going after your organization or your

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
area it's time that they could have been

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,598
spending doing something else trying to

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,280
try to attack a different a different

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
target so even at even at scale

69
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
this ends up this ends up mattering and

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
time is also a factor for them as well

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
like

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
uh if if there's a particular event or

73
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
there's some type of thing that they're

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
trying to do

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,920
the the time necessary to do it

76
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,400
uh may have passed if they don't move

77
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,599
fast enough so there may be certain

78
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,440
effects at the geopolitical side that

79
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
they may be looking for

80
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
and and so time is also a factor with

81
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
them

82
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
and then we talk about

83
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,280
look at it from the defender side so as

84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
a defender

85
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,239
what is the value of the thing that i'm

86
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,879
protecting so i'm going to protect a

87
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,560
simple video game i make

88
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,319
differently from the way i would protect

89
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
financial information

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599
what is the likeliness of that thing of

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,920
that thing being being attacked and

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
likeliness here is also a bit

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
interesting as well because it's not

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
just is it likely to be attacked of

95
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
course all systems are going to be

96
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,480
attacked over time

97
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,319
but the likeliness also comes towards

98
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,680
what what is the amount of effort that

99
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
the attacker is going to put so this

100
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
ties it back to the economics from the

101
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,239
from the attacker's side

102
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
um and

103
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,680
the defender also ends up looking at

104
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
things like what is the value

105
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
what is the value lost if an incident

106
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
occurs or if the attack's successful so

107
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,319
maybe there's some

108
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,120
maybe there's a particular device

109
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,200
and if the device by incident let's say

110
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
it's stolen just as an example there's

111
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
the the value of what was on there

112
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,760
there's the value of the hardware there

113
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
are possible penalties if the device is

114
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,120
stolen and there are not enough

115
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,959
protections on it so

116
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
we call this the exposure factor and

117
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
finally what is the cost of protecting

118
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
the system so every defense that we take

119
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
has a cost associated to it so the cost

120
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,319
could be like what is the cost of

121
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,640
encrypting all hard drives what is the

122
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,599
cost of spending the time in order to

123
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
set up a service mesh the time to

124
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,400
operate and administrate it

125
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
and so cost of a defender often in

126
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
quantitative analysis you'll see these

127
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,319
type of equations so

128
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,439
um

129
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
there's there tends to be somebody in

130
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,879
larger organizations who are using some

131
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
derivative of these type of these type

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,799
of things so these three i put up just

133
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
to give you an idea as to what type of

134
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
things people look for so single loss

135
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,238
expectancy is like

136
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,560
some incident occurs is

137
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
let's say it's a break-in or something's

138
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
lost

139
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,919
then what is the what is the exposure so

140
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,680
in other words the the value of the of

141
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
the asset and the exposure factor

142
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
exposure factor is is a multiplic is a

143
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,560
multiplicative

144
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
thing where you take the value and let's

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
say that you lose 20 percent of the

146
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
value if a certain attack occurs so that

147
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
means that if you have something that's

148
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
worth a thousand dollars attack the tax

149
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,800
successful the va the remainder value

150
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
or the

151
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,080
the loss at that time is 20 so your

152
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,479
exposure your exposure factor would be

153
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,919
would be 0.2

154
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,639
so

155
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,880
this then feeds into the annualized loss

156
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
expectancy so what that is is like okay

157
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,080
we expect to lose

158
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
500 hard drives over the year so then

159
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
you can take all of that and say well

160
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,039
let's multiply whatever that number was

161
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,919
before by 500 and that gets you the the

162
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,080
average loss per year interestingly this

163
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,919
also works even if even if the thing is

164
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,360
only happens let's say once every 10

165
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,639
years like maybe you say once every 10

166
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,919
years we have a flood that damages the

167
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,560
data center your annual your annual rate

168
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,479
of occurrence at that point is 0.1 so

169
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,199
you can this even works in in a long

170
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,639
time

171
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
in long time scales the residual value

172
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
and this is really the number to watch

173
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
out for is what is the cost what is the

174
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
value of what is you're protecting minus

175
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
the cost of operating and contr and uh

176
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
and defending it because that remainder

177
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
value is the is the

178
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
total value of the of the product or of

179
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
the thing that you're working with or of

180
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,120
the data

181
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,919
and the the reality of it is that if you

182
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,400
have a negative residual value this is

183
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
actually costing you money and at that

184
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,319
point you have to ask the question is is

185
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
it worth whatever we're doing is it

186
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,680
worth doing what we're doing or is there

187
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
a different way we can defend it while

188
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
still meeting our expectations so

189
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,400
this residual value becomes very

190
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,840
important when you're trying to decide

191
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,039
what i'm what are we going to defend

192
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,039
so

193
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,520
um a really simple example is what is

194
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
the cost of log for shell so if you

195
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
apply these equations to log for shell

196
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
like what is the the asset value what is

197
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,199
the cost the cost of that particular

198
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
thing has been compromised the annual

199
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
rate of occurrence well how many systems

200
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
out there do we have to go and repair

201
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
um

202
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
over over time what was that cost the

203
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,639
residual cost was like we had that value

204
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,919
of whatever it is we're running that

205
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,479
infrastructure minus the cost of

206
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,039
mitigating defending the log for shell

207
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,960
uh issue and so we can see that our

208
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
residual value has dropped as a result

209
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
of such an attack so we can see this

210
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,960
this in there

211
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,800
so why this little mini talk before is

212
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,360
because anything we do when we talk

213
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
about like why are we bringing in

214
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,199
s-bombs why are we bringing in all the

215
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
variety of things you see here the

216
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,960
economics the economics matter and so if

217
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
we if we use this concept of

218
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,680
qualitative risk and reward quantitative

219
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
trying to determine what the value is

220
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
then that helps provide us with some

221
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,880
model that we can try to work out what

222
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
to prioritize and so the attackers want

223
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,400
maximum reward for minimal risk so there

224
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
may be a financial they may be looking

225
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,840
at time they may be looking at the

226
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
chances of being caught what's the

227
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,880
penalty being caught and there's

228
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
numerous other factors as well but start

229
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,840
but start to think about some of this as

230
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,599
what not only in terms of what is the

231
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,759
cost of the defender also think about it

232
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
what is the what is the value that the

233
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,599
attacker is going to get out of this and

234
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,800
what is their effort what is their

235
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
chance of being caught because if you

236
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
look like a hardened target with limited

237
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,280
value

238
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
you'll still be attacked but

239
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
there'll be more time spent in targets

240
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
that are that are higher in value and

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
easier to compromise over time

242
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,800
so with that

243
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
the main message is

244
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
do everything you ethically and morally

245
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
can to shift the economic equations in

246
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
your favor

247
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
so just keep that in mind

248
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
so with that let's talk about vex

249
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,080
so

250
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
if we look at

251
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
some of the newer trends that are coming

252
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,039
on we have software build of materials

253
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,000
so they're a set of claims um

254
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
when you just one little note when you

255
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
hear the term claim you'll hear the term

256
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,800
claim quite often and you'll hear the

257
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
term at the stations

258
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
a claim isn't the claim isn't now i have

259
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,399
a claim i have something that that that

260
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,559
professes something another station is a

261
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
verb so i attest something generate a

262
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,519
claim

263
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
so

264
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
the s ball of materials is a set of

265
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,599
claims

266
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,839
that will describe who built it who

267
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
provided it

268
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
what uh what is within the particular

269
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,839
package what are the artifacts when was

270
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,200
it created where was it created so

271
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
there's a whole bunch of things that are

272
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
within an s bomb that

273
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,600
that are

274
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
included and so

275
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
one of the key things though as well is

276
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,680
we have these dependencies and the

277
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,519
dependencies of dependencies also mapped

278
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,240
out ideally as as a set of recursive s

279
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
bombs that we can go and and look

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,959
through

281
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,360
um it does off often it does not include

282
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
the how so the how is like i ran this

283
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,920
compiler these are the steps that i took

284
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
these are the uh these are these are the

285
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
ways i included these particular

286
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
artifacts those matter as well but very

287
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,000
often you have to bring in something

288
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
else like in toto to to deal with it so

289
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,279
generally software building material

290
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,680
gives you a a good picture of what's in

291
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
something but it's not the it's not the

292
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
full story

293
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,480
so there's a modeling gap here the

294
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,720
modeling gap is that

295
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,399
s-bombs are static you produce them at

296
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,920
build time generally or shortly

297
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
afterwards

298
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
and vulnerabilities tend to be dynamic

299
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
we discover them over time

300
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,240
so

301
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,760
this means that

302
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
there are there are some people who

303
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
think oh why don't we stick the cvs in

304
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
the s bomb

305
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
a better approach

306
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,200
instead is we

307
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
we keep the s bomb that s bomb becomes a

308
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
key to your cve database so you're able

309
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,880
to then check okay well i have this i

310
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,360
have this version of log for j keyed

311
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
against these vulnerabilities i was able

312
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
to see i can get a sense as to as to

313
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
where things are but this lead this does

314
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,040
leave us with a with a modeling gap

315
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,880
that's there

316
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,680
and so there is a major effort going on

317
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
throughout multiple companies and has

318
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
been for a while in order to map

319
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,959
uh

320
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,360
versions to cves one of the newer

321
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
manifestations of this is mapping the

322
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
actual cvs or ds monsters to your cv so

323
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
literally the s bomb identifier is your

324
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
key

325
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,160
you extract all the dependencies and

326
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
then you can recursively check okay

327
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
let's go check each of those with their

328
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
keys to see what's to see what's inside

329
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,800
of it and with that we we would expect

330
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,160
to be done but unfortunately we are not

331
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
the reason why

332
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,640
is that cves don't tell the the whole

333
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,920
story

334
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,720
so

335
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,560
not everything is affected by its

336
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,160
vulnerabilities

337
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
and so you when you spin up a dashboard

338
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,200
or you're running a whole bunch of

339
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,240
scanners

340
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,839
you often get a whole bunch of different

341
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
vulnerabilities that you're not affected

342
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,279
by

343
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,880
and so this creates when you're running

344
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
a large operation this this generates a

345
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
lot of noise like how many people

346
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,160
uh as developers you run a

347
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
static code scanner or something that

348
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
that looks for vulnerabilities and the

349
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
number of

350
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
red flags that comes up that are false

351
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,519
positives like just makes your

352
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,880
development team say i don't want to do

353
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
this anymore because at that point every

354
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
time that you have these vulnerabilities

355
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
pop up

356
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,240
that are that are not affecting you it

357
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
ends up it draws your attention you have

358
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,320
to explain to the to the security team

359
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,839
why it's not an issue

360
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,600
it ends up it ends up

361
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
creating issues where maybe there is a

362
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
real vulnerability there but there's so

363
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
many other things there that you that

364
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
you you're not gonna even if you spend

365
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
the time to try to find it there's a

366
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,360
good chance you might miss it

367
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
so now think about this and i imagine

368
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
you're running an organization that has

369
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
thousands of applications tens of

370
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
thousands hundreds of thousands of

371
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,760
workloads

372
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
and spread across multiple

373
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
multiple locations now you're talking

374
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
about a problem that at scale is

375
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,600
incredibly expensive and the c and the

376
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,880
cve

377
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
noise that you have there ends up

378
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,760
limiting the total

379
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,279
value that you that you have there and

380
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,200
you have to make much broader

381
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
uh approaches

382
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
in terms of how to mitigate them

383
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,519
one of my favorite examples is lib curl

384
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
so lib curl is a library you can use to

385
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
has a client to connect to all sorts of

386
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
different things most people know of it

387
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
as an http client

388
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,519
but it turns turns out you can also

389
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,160
support other protocols like tftp

390
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,120
there was a bug in tftp that was thought

391
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,839
to be fixed turns out it wasn't fixed

392
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
and what it did is if you connected it

393
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,240
using an ssl certificate it would leak

394
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
out some information that would allow

395
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
for decryption of whatever that material

396
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,600
is and i believe a compromise of the

397
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
actual private key itself i believe was

398
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,959
part of it

399
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,600
this only occurred if you were using

400
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
tftp

401
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,079
so very few people use tftp so if you

402
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,760
were not using that then you were in

403
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
good shape you run a scanner on top of

404
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,399
it though you're going to get a message

405
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
saying hey you have this really high

406
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,720
level cve i think it was like a 9.0 or

407
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
something at that level

408
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,519
out of 10

409
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
that you need to go and resolve so of

410
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
course your teams are going to come back

411
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,639
and say you have to you have to patch

412
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
this because they have no way to tell

413
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
whether or not you're vulnerable they

414
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,079
can you can have a conversation with

415
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,839
them but but from their scanning

416
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,480
perspectives they're not able to tell

417
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,440
and so

418
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
most applications though were not

419
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
affected even though they're vulnerable

420
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,959
because they did not use tftp

421
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,320
so

422
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,079
we have to work around the gap

423
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,160
today the way we work around those gaps

424
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
is we often create policies that say

425
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,480
whenever a cve over a certain number is

426
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
there we have to upgrade it no no

427
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
questions asked

428
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,839
this ends up increasing the total cost

429
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
of ownership also includes risk because

430
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
whenever you upgrade something there is

431
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,720
a risk that you might end up with

432
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,000
something failing there's a risk that

433
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,760
you might have something misconfigured

434
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
and so

435
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
so there's additional costs and risk

436
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
that's that's attached there um you may

437
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,720
end up

438
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,079
hopping onto your vendor and saying hey

439
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,920
is this thing affected or is it not

440
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,519
affected maybe you go look for for a

441
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,440
blog post um

442
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
you may have a vendor representative

443
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
that you go and discuss like literally

444
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
hop onto the phones and say hey

445
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,079
are we affected by log4j yes or no and

446
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
uh having been on the conversation for

447
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,760
some of these i've i've seen

448
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
multiple answers that were like no we're

449
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,839
not affected because we shut that off or

450
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
because

451
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,800
the library was brought in but we never

452
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
spin it up we never use it

453
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
so but when you do a scan it's there you

454
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,959
can see it

455
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,360
there's also issues around

456
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
how do you can also look at mitigating

457
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
it so mitigating say well we'll stick

458
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
something in front of it that'll scan

459
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,519
for these type of attacks or

460
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,920
um or you may end up accepting the risk

461
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
saying you know what we know it's there

462
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,360
but we're going to operate anyway

463
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,800
because we've we've analyzed we're going

464
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,880
to accept the risk uh you eliminate it

465
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,639
by saying hey we're just gonna get rid

466
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,240
of the product like the product's too

467
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,920
troublesome or it's not generating

468
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360
enough the residual value is not

469
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,120
negative not worth running anymore and

470
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
we don't have any obligations to

471
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,360
continue writing it so sometimes you may

472
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,079
see

473
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,279
uh see it

474
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,880
eliminated over time

475
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
um there's also another one which is a

476
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,639
little bit uh a little bit weird which

477
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
is you can transfer the risk um it turns

478
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
out with ransomware there's a whole

479
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
bunch of companies that uh say oh we're

480
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
covered for ransomware oh great how did

481
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
you how do you mitigate it oh we got an

482
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
insurance policy we pay out it's like

483
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,600
okay this is terrible

484
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
um there's actually a couple things that

485
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
if i don't know if they passed or not

486
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
but there were some discussions by some

487
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
uh by some governments

488
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
that if they were to declare ransomware

489
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,360
attacks to be a terrorist attack then at

490
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
that point the insurance companies that

491
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,959
deal in that space would not be able to

492
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,399
pay out for ransomware so they'd be able

493
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,560
to cover other things like a hard drive

494
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
was lost or something like that and then

495
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,320
help you recoup getting another hard

496
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
drive but in terms of ransomware attacks

497
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
it's possible that if it's not already

498
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
there's a good chance that we may

499
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
actually see that particular one go away

500
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
at least at least in the transfer of

501
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
risk

502
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,199
and so

503
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,639
with that we have all these ways of like

504
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,240
we're trying to work around it that are

505
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,320
unique to every organization

506
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
um and so there's a couple groups that

507
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
got together

508
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
in order to create this program called

509
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
devex

510
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,839
and so

511
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,560
right now vex is a draft in the new

512
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,120
oasis csaf 2.0 standard

513
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,240
um

514
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,800
there's a couple implementations of vex

515
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,440
that don't follow the csaf example but

516
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
they provide the same structure the same

517
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,120
piece of information and it's designed

518
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
for one thing it's designed to provide a

519
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
common way to tell

520
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,839
from a machine readable perspective

521
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,079
am i vulnerable not only am i vulnerable

522
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,920
but specifically am i affected by a

523
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,319
specific vulnerability

524
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,279
so every vex document has at the minimum

525
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,480
there's a little little bit more than

526
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,560
this but at minimum it has these things

527
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,639
it'll have a product tree which lists

528
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,680
all of the products that have been

529
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
referenced by that document the affected

530
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
status is it fixed is it known is it

531
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,799
known to be affected is it known to not

532
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,280
be affected by it like the tftp lib curl

533
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
thing when you don't use tftp

534
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
or is it under currently under

535
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,480
investigation

536
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
um part of it as well is there is

537
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,559
there's a gap here where

538
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,480
the cv has to link to some id which

539
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,760
could be a cve or might be a bug id um

540
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,799
and so

541
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,240
if you have one of those you're good but

542
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,319
if you don't then you have to have some

543
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,919
way of eventually binding it so that's

544
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,280
one

545
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
one little nuance with it

546
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,720
but one of the neat things about it

547
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,559
though is that there's also information

548
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,320
where you you can describe how to

549
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,000
resolve it so the way you resolve might

550
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,919
say upgrade to this version or i might

551
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,280
say

552
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,000
to

553
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
to mitigate using these steps you know

554
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
follow these three steps disable this in

555
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,559
the configuration and then you will no

556
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,400
longer be affected

557
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
and they'll also be notes quite often

558
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
about the details of it so this is

559
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
designed to be to be machine readable

560
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
with a workflow that looks something

561
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,679
like this

562
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,240
you have you have a deployed application

563
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
you have an s-bomb

564
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,360
or a set of s-bombs that describe your

565
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
application let's say the new cv comes

566
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,360
out

567
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,400
and so

568
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
now the cv is popped up in your

569
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,200
dashboard

570
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
best case in so best case scenario you

571
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
have analysis you're able to work out

572
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
that the cve is there

573
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
so you need to determine how are you

574
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
going to how are you going to work with

575
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,480
this particular system

576
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
if you don't have vex you have to assume

577
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
you're affected you have to force an

578
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,960
upgrade or you have to go find more

579
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,840
information through other channels

580
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,080
with vex the team can look up a vex

581
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,919
document if no vex statement exists then

582
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,520
my preferred

583
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
approach is going to be to ask the

584
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
vendors hey can you please publish

585
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
something because if they publish it

586
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
then that's not just me that receives

587
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
the information it's everyone who's on

588
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,960
the product who receives it so it helps

589
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
with that but

590
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
uh let's assume that they've they've

591
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
issued a vex statement out that vex

592
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,520
statement can then be

593
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
ingested into the cyber security

594
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,240
dashboards of the various infosec teams

595
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
which that initial flag turned on

596
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,480
because of the the cv being there and

597
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
then if it's if it's affected it stays

598
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
on and we can say hey this has been the

599
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
vendor has stated or we can shut it off

600
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
and say hey the

601
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
the vendor has even though we see it

602
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,919
there we sit still in our report our

603
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,360
vendor has given us assurances that

604
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
we're that we're in good shape which

605
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
means you get to focus your attention on

606
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
the areas where you actually have

607
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
vulnerability or where you have a lack

608
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,679
of information

609
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,559
so

610
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
in short

611
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,200
s-bombs tell you what's in your

612
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,799
infrastructure

613
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,200
cves tell you what vulnerabilities are

614
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
in your infrastructure and vex tells you

615
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,039
which of those vulnerabilities you're

616
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,200
affected by so this is the

617
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,520
the one the uh three-liner will say

618
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
see a couple of people taking photos so

619
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,320
i'll give it a give it a brief moment

620
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,039
so

621
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,039
there are a couple gaps

622
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
the first the first gap is that

623
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
so vex is a claim as to whether a

624
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,320
software product is given by a

625
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,960
vulnerability so the so the first part

626
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,360
is do you trust the person or the

627
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
organization who is putting together the

628
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,840
statement because

629
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
i could put together a vex statement

630
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,600
about your product and say i believe it

631
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,679
has this problem or does not have this

632
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,280
problem so you want to look at who's

633
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
generating it uh who's generating that

634
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
information so

635
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,720
in general vendors will probably be

636
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
considered to be high higher quality you

637
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,880
may also have over time you might find

638
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,159
that certain vendors might be a little

639
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,080
bit more flaky so given enough time

640
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
given enough time we may be able to pick

641
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
up some information uh flaky's wrong

642
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
word we'll say inaccurate because of the

643
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,200
complexity of the products um and so

644
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
so over time we'll be able to tell what

645
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
from a percentage perspective given the

646
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,760
long enough time horizon what is the

647
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
likeliness of what is the accuracy of

648
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
those of those statements so that's

649
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
still that's still an open question but

650
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,520
generally it's going to be much better

651
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
than what we had before

652
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
um vex does not also provide a way to

653
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,559
normalize the vendor and product

654
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,640
information uh by that it's like you

655
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
pull in a product there's there might be

656
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
let's say you're pulling kubernetes how

657
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,919
many different ways are there to say i

658
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,480
use kubernetes and to version that

659
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,400
information within the within the s-bomb

660
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
so there's there's some issues around uh

661
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,840
version normalization that needs to

662
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,679
occur and finally if there's no if

663
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
there's a vulnerability with no cv or

664
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
common bug id that you can point to like

665
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,919
a github issue or or bugzilla or so on

666
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,240
then there's there

667
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
it is a required element to have it in

668
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,880
there so

669
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
you we may we may have to put something

670
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,840
in there just say hey we have an

671
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,600
internal database or there's something

672
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,719
there that we can bind against

673
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,960
so with that i want to thank you for for

674
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,159
your time

675
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
and i'll be around uh shortly afterwards

676
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,720
but are we able to take questions as

677
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,520
well we still have a little bit of time

678
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
so are there any questions that people

679
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
have so i see one and then there's one

680
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
second one back there

681
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
can we have the microphone on please

682
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,600
you hear me okay the question is about

683
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,679
s-bomb so it's always problematic to

684
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,480
let me say force the developers to

685
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
embrace the asthma

686
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
in

687
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,760
manual ways so there are some automated

688
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,240
way language independent to generate

689
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,200
this kind of artifact because otherwise

690
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,520
this is a beautiful approach to manage

691
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,720
this kind of

692
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,760
security problem but we don't give some

693
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,280
tools to developers it's very hard to

694
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
implement it

695
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,960
yeah that's that's a that's a good

696
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,159
question so

697
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,600
let me make sure i paraphrase it just to

698
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
be that i have a problem so you're

699
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,799
you're worried about the s-bomb itself

700
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,159
that they're not standardized there

701
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,679
might be different reporting standards

702
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,320
different versions or names and and ways

703
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,120
that people live together so

704
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,640
what was the last one and also the

705
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
automation of the generation this kind

706
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,120
of artifact ah yes and and the

707
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,559
generation of it as well different tools

708
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,080
put out different things so this is a

709
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,320
problem uh s-bombs are relatively new

710
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,919
things so we're still

711
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,840
we're still in the phase of learning how

712
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
to generate them properly and with

713
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
enough information um i think that

714
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
there's a few things are going to happen

715
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
over time so

716
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,159
the first one is the commercial products

717
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,520
those ones will be a little bit easier

718
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,000
because in time the companies will say

719
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,960
these are the type of things we're

720
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
looking for i think we'll see

721
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
forces the economic forces will

722
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,919
normalize some of those over over time

723
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,400
uh one of the problems that we do see

724
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
and let me go ahead and shut this off

725
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,039
because there's a

726
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
graphic on it so i'll

727
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,000
put it here

728
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,799
so one of the problems that we have is

729
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,280
that if you're running an open source

730
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
community we're already starting to see

731
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
people reach out saying

732
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,799
you're you're an open source vendor

733
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,240
who's provided me with this thing you

734
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
have to provide the zest bomb and it's

735
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,960
like

736
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
telling an open source that they have to

737
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,240
maintain or they have to do something

738
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
when they're not paying them for it

739
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,720
they're not there's no business

740
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
relationship there is really weird and

741
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,279
so

742
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,600
a couple ways to go about this in order

743
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
to help is for the larger projects we

744
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
have i think projects are in the cncf

745
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,760
and so on we're trying to set up through

746
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
the tag security and other similar

747
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,720
groups to try to work out what's proper

748
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,880
guidance to help the developers in that

749
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,559
area but if it's something that's

750
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,320
important to you there's a there's a

751
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,440
couple of ways that we're starting to

752
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,520
see this handle so the first one is that

753
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,640
some of the companies are starting to

754
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,919
reach out to open source companies and

755
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,360
say hey we'll provide

756
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,600
financial means or we'll provide people

757
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
to help make this happen make sure that

758
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,400
automation occurs

759
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
another thing that another pattern we're

760
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
starting to see happen as well is that

761
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
if a company ingests a open source

762
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,480
project

763
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
even if there's no s bomb there they'll

764
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
it's like when you cite your sources

765
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,159
we'll say uh this came from this person

766
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,080
at this particular time with and we've

767
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,200
signed the

768
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
we've counter-signed it just so we say

769
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,200
it's that that's what it was so and

770
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
here's the scan that we did on top of it

771
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
so there's some use for scanning for the

772
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
scanning style s bombs rather than the

773
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,600
build time s bombs that we're going to

774
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,080
see using this as well not as high

775
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,760
quality of information unfortunately

776
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
because you lose information during the

777
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,440
build time but but those are some of the

778
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
patterns that we're seeing in order to

779
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
to help there and then over time i will

780
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
see where things progress as as the

781
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,880
industry matures so does that answer the

782
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,480
question

783
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,320
perfect and there was another one back

784
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,320
there

785
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,279
thank you

786
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,799
i was wondering

787
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,760
how

788
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,799
available is vex documents today and is

789
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,520
there some kind of

790
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
catalog where we can find existing vex

791
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,760
documents

792
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,240
to easily ingest this kind of data

793
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,320
that's a great question so this is this

794
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,720
is very new like as in this is all stuff

795
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,279
that's been developing in the past

796
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,919
uh we'll say six months or so so there's

797
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,159
not a there's not a very good repository

798
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,480
yet for these type of vex statements to

799
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,000
be to be created

800
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
that is something that i think as an

801
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,919
industry uh it's actually a gap that i'm

802
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,240
i'm hoping that over time perhaps

803
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,600
the open source

804
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,360
open source software found software

805
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
security foundation open ssf might be

806
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,880
able to help with or

807
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
perhaps the cncf maybe you'll help in

808
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
some of these areas but that is a major

809
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,880
that is a major gap um over and it also

810
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
depends on over time uh we'll see where

811
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,799
some of this ends up as well but we're

812
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,799
starting to see some of the vex

813
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,200
information start to appear not only in

814
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,400
open uh not only in the csaf oasis

815
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,679
project but we're also starting to see

816
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,159
like cyclone dx has their own version of

817
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,600
the of the same information that's

818
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,559
attached there as well uh under the vex

819
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,159
name uh as well so i so in time right

820
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,720
now it's it's very it's very new so this

821
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
is not something that you could go and

822
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
say implement today but it's something

823
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
to keep in mind if you're a vendor if

824
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,320
you're in if you're in charge of this

825
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,080
kind of stuff or if you're on the

826
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,000
consumer side to be able to say hey

827
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,760
we're really interested in this uh

828
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,440
because it helps reduce the total cost

829
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,120
of ownership and helps and helps you

830
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
focus and get and shifts the

831
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
it's just the needle on the economics on

832
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,279
where on where to spend your your time

833
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,360
so anything that helps in that direction

834
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,240
i i'm hoping we'll will see some

835
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,320
engagement towards this so right now

836
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,679
it's very new

837
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,400
i

838
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,279
i

839
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,440
we're seeing a lot of uh we're seeing a

840
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
lot of interest in this uh interestingly

841
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
the lar the largest group that is

842
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,799
interested in this stuff is the us

843
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,320
government so

844
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
uh if they manage to put it inside of

845
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
their um

846
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
or if they decide to put it inside of

847
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
their fed ramp or one of their other

848
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
similar programs and then at that point

849
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
we should see massive adoption

850
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,880
throughout at least the pri major

851
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
portions of the private sector and

852
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
hopefully those tools will evolve and

853
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,960
mature and then a best-case scenario

854
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,279
they'll be easy to use dashboards or

855
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,000
easy ways to generate these documents

856
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,320
in in ways that don't cost developers

857
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,480
much because again we talk about the

858
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,320
economics what is economics to the

859
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
developer if it's the expense of the

860
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,039
developer they're probably not going to

861
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,679
want to do it or be able to do it

862
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,960
because it because of the expense and so

863
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,480
we have to keep it we do have to keep an

864
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
eye on on those type of properties not

865
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,159
only for vex but also the creation of s

866
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,000
bombs

867
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,039
so

868
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,640
uh i think there's one here and then at

869
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,440
that point we'll be at time

870
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,880
and thank you very much for helping

871
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,039
um i feel what vex is trying to do is

872
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,520
sometimes done through cves so you would

873
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
have for example log for shell that has

874
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,039
a cve number

875
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,200
but you would also have vendors uh you

876
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,120
know like products that consume log for

877
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,600
shell like for j story that also have a

878
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,919
cv associated like

879
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,440
you know to like report that they're

880
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,919
vulnerable to it um so

881
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,840
how do you how do you think about like

882
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,440
we could we could manage this situation

883
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,039
and avoid having

884
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,159
you know multiple cvs for one route uh

885
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,399
you know vulnerability uh for all the

886
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,440
products that consume that dependency

887
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,360
yeah that's a good question and so

888
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
the product we run into with cvs there's

889
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,360
two problems the first cves if you've

890
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
ever tried to parse the cv from from the

891
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,320
miter group uh it's possible to parse it

892
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,159
but it was really made for for

893
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,840
presenting humans so that's the first

894
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,279
problem we run into

895
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,919
the second problem that we run into is

896
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,399
so if it's a one-to-one product like you

897
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,159
have a vendor that says hey our product

898
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:08,960
uh

899
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
over here has this problem

900
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,399
or a small number of vendors and then

901
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,159
you're in okay shape but what ends up

902
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,600
happening is when you get something like

903
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,760
log for j the quantity of products that

904
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
are affected by it are so high

905
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,679
that that cve if you were to list every

906
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,760
single product that's inside of it that

907
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
cd is going to be like massive and will

908
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,679
be useless to people so being able to

909
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,440
create the vex document that links that

910
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,679
cve and says whether they're affected or

911
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,120
or not

912
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,640
helps and usually what they do is they

913
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,399
there's a number called a cpe so they

914
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,080
usually look at the cpe number and then

915
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,760
look at the the version there and match

916
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,080
that to the vulnerability but that says

917
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,679
the vulnerability is there but doesn't

918
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,360
tell you whether or not that particular

919
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,880
product is affected or not so your

920
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,679
scanners will say yes this is there

921
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,960
then you have to assume you're affected

922
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,120
and so vex will provide additional

923
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
context that will that will help

924
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
determine whether whether or not it's

925
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
affected or not with information coming

926
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,760
from the vendor or or a trusted source

927
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840
so hopefully does that help answer the

928
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,158
question

929
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,960
it was more about duplicate cvs so like

930
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,279
instead of having a cpe that says okay

931
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,960
this product is also affected by that

932
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,600
cve sometimes you would see another cv

933
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,880
created

934
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
oh yes you know so like yeah hopefully

935
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,679
we reduce that because that's also noisy

936
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,679
like if you can have one cve and then

937
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,720
you're able to say these are all the

938
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,159
products are affected by it is a much

939
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,760
better than saying here are the 10 cvs

940
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,360
it all mapped to the same do the same

941
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
thing so thank you for highlighting that

942
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
that that is something that i think vex

943
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,600
will will definitely help with

944
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,039
so i want to thank you for your time and

945
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,880
also thank tiffany for for helping with

946
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,559
this as well so

947
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,720
thank you
