uh voted in as a co-chair of tank

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,320
security so i'm here uh resting on the

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
laurels of other people this time round

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
there's a lot of hard work that goes

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,039
into these events

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
we have brandon of course radnor as well

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
we operate on a tech lead

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,399
and sort of nominative basis so right

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
now we have uh the the three reputable

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
individuals um andres attusion pushkar

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,000
and

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
this means that in this position these

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,239
individuals take initiatives forwards

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,760
they propose things they help to

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,439
shepherd things through uh and we'll

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,040
look at some of the some of the great

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
work that people have been doing

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,119
and we have just nominated another round

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640
of excellent tech lead colleagues uh we

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,680
have michael lieberman marina moore and

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
ragashra shekhar

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
they will come in and

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,840
help us to move forward at a greater

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,680
velocity there is so much work that

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,520
needs to be done and we really

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
appreciate all the community involvement

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
all the volunteering efforts that people

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
put in to help move cloud native

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,640
security in the tag forward

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,000
all right so

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,720
besides some security con that we do

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
well used to be called security day this

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
was like we started this about three

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
four years ago and it started off as a

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
single day

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
single track event

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,799
to now we've we've gone through like two

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
day we have a ctf going on alongside so

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
the we've really evolved this and we're

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,159
kind of growing this a little bit more

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
uh and we're kind of excited to see

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,239
where this can go but besides that we

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,440
also do

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,399
um

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,879
both technical work uh in terms of like

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,879
writing white papers

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,440
we we do write down documents about best

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
practices as you've seen in

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
yesterday's presentation on how to use

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,959
these

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,680
security supply chain best practices

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
uh into integrating into um

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
the supply chain pipelines in your

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
organizations

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
so just to share a few these are some of

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,760
the new releases that we had

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
the community has been working together

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
we have multiple working groups we have

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
serverless working group we have a

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
supply chain working group

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,959
controls working group

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,720
and so

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
these are some of the new documents that

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,680
are coming out this week for kubecon eu

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
so we have the

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
um secure software factory reference

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,519
architecture paper so originally we had

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
the best practices paper the reference

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
architecture paper really tells you how

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,319
do you go about to actually build a

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,360
secure

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
secure buildup

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,800
so all the links are in here the the

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
presentation is uploaded to chat the

88
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,480
code so you can just download it from

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
there

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
we have the cognitive security

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
whitepaper v2

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,319
which includes uh all the nis ssdf

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,720
mappings if the eo is something that

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
you're looking to to target and meet the

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,120
requirements of we talk about ransomware

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
we talk about git ups you talk about eu

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
regulations and all that

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,200
um we have the attack security in this

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
control mappings

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,879
which maps the original security white

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,319
paper to the nis 800-53

102
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,120
and also for those that have not seen um

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
the first white paper and you want to

104
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,200
get more like you like audiobooks

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
we now have like audio recording that

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,280
was done by various people in the

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,840
community

108
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,239
and there are lots of things coming up

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
the open source summit in north america

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,439
austin texas next month will feature a

111
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
new event the global security

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
vulnerability summit

113
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
this is an attempt to answer the

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
perennial question what do we do with

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
the backlog of cves that we're

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
collecting as an industry there has to

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
be a better way to do it than we do it

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,919
now we presume and this is an

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,600
opportunity again to engage with the

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,120
community interested and excited minds

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,600
and try and ideate something that will

122
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
help us to cut through the uh

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
the molasses of

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
of cve management as i'm sure those of

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
us who manage our cloud native minimum

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,320
viable security no

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
yeah we also have the cognitive service

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,199
serverless security white paper that um

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
we had a panel on earlier and so this is

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
currently in public rfc

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
so we are we are gathering all your

132
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
input to tell us like what what do you

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
why are you looking for in serverless

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
security are we missing some things that

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,919
should be talked about

136
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,720
um

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
we're also working and a lot of the

138
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
issues that you see here are new we are

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,800
starting to work on them so if you see

140
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
anything that you're interested in we're

141
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
going to talk a little bit later on how

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,039
you can get involved

143
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,720
one thing that the supply chain working

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
group is working on is creating cloud

145
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
native s-bomb guidance

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
right we talk about s-bomb we talk about

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,160
generating s-bombs but why are you

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
supposed to generate who's responsible

149
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,840
for generating s-bombs

150
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
and so the effort is to kind of be able

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,919
to to provide guidance on for

152
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,440
cloud-native technologies what should we

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
do

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,759
then we have the nist security controls

155
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,880
mapping

156
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
again looking to

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
help implementers and people working at

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
the coalface to

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
implement sometimes difficult compliance

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
or auditory regulations um this will

161
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
give us a view on on how to move forward

162
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,759
take advice from colleagues and people

163
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,960
who've implemented these kind of things

164
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
before

165
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,440
the supply chain best practices again a

166
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
collection of volunteers and interesting

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
minds

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
put together this paper

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,919
which is technical detail on how best to

170
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,600
secure our supply chains

171
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
um end-to-end looking kind of

172
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,560
farm-to-table uh or uh end-user device

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
to production

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
and looking to tie together all of these

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
nebulous concepts that we have here

176
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
the s-bomb being a key point right now

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,759
what do we actually do with these

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,319
s-bombs how do we generate them

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,880
and so what we'll do in an effort to

180
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,759
make this obvious and repeatable

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
we'll take an example cncf product

182
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,280
project rather and

183
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,919
we will put it into the secure software

184
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
factory we will apply the best practices

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,199
to its configuration to its ci cd to its

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,880
contributor framework

187
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
and give what is essentially a cookie

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
cutter reference implementation of this

189
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,479
is what we think good looks like and

190
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,520
then again

191
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,080
do this in the in a community aspect

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
and allow it to be then critiqued we can

193
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
all feedback and then

194
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
find a shared understanding hopefully

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
move ourselves forward

196
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,080
then some some really uh

197
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
some really interesting things here

198
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,800
these are some of my particular

199
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
favorites the guidance on container

200
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,400
breakout vulnerabilities there have been

201
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,199
a lot of kernel related escapes recently

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,680
we look at things like dirty pipe

203
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
very quick zero day dropped without much

204
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,599
of an embargo

205
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,280
these things require very real and

206
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,520
immediate remediation and we're looking

207
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
to put together a framework again to

208
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,199
help understand these to help move us

209
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
forward quickly and then finally

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
many projects come into tag security

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
with a request for an appraisal and

212
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,319
audit a security review of some

213
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,680
description

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
part of this and something very dear to

215
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,639
my heart is a lightweight threat

216
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,280
modeling exercise this looks at the the

217
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,360
broad question the catastrophization

218
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
what could possibly go wrong

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,879
what are we going to do about that thing

220
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,120
that goes wrong and then we iterate and

221
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
loop around there so that we

222
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
can apply security controls in an order

223
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,680
of precedence based on impact based on

224
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
risk based upon what we think this thing

225
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,960
will actually do

226
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,560
and we're looking again just to increase

227
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,919
the velocity and to make sure that we

228
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
can be as valuable to as many projects

229
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,080
as possible

230
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
with that i'd like to invite our

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
esteemed

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
uh ctf runners

233
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
lewis and james

234
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
to run us through how the ctf went today

235
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
thank you andy

236
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
hey everyone um i hope if you've got a

237
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,560
cluster for the ctf you enjoyed it um

238
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
first of all we had unprecedented demand

239
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,559
um

240
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,000
yeah we had we spun up over well 50

241
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
instances for users so with 50 that

242
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
meant that we spun up three clusters

243
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,000
each now those three clusters had

244
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,519
different scenarios

245
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
um each of those had five nodes so we've

246
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,279
just spun up over 800 vms some of them

247
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
were working as we expected some of them

248
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,519
may um

249
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,040
but yes and so to that i would like to

250
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
say first of all thank you to uh james

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
cp

252
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,440
um

253
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
if you've seen us sat outside you might

254
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,279
see you're like why those uh why those

255
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,640
guys so stressed well um yeah it's um

256
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,279
yeah sre on conference wi-fi trying to

257
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
manage misconfigured clusters it's it's

258
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,000
been phenomenal um

259
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,480
so our scenario is today

260
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
these were brand new scenarios uh for

261
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
exclusively for this event um we're not

262
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
going to give you all the answers right

263
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
now if you want answers come and find us

264
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
tomorrow we're happy to talk to you

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
about them but our first cluster was

266
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
inspired by the movie back to the future

267
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,880
if anyone's seen that um did anyone

268
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
reference the age of the vms that you're

269
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
using to begin with

270
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
if not come and find us tomorrow we'll

271
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
give you some more of them um the second

272
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
one that we had well and also that was

273
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
based on inception so have some fun with

274
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,279
that uh the next one was die hard which

275
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,200
is actually more like um now that's what

276
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
i call hacking volume 44 which was like

277
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,320
our mega mix of lots of different things

278
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,680
and to the next one our pastor james

279
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
thanks lewis um

280
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,399
so the the quiet place uh scenario was

281
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,440
based on

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,839
the film quiet place

283
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
uh as some of you may have found we had

284
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
a runtime detection agent

285
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
um

286
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,519
trying to prevent users doing bits in

287
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,480
the cluster so the idea was it modeled a

288
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,600
uh sort of more red team-tiled scenario

289
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
where you were the attacker trying to

290
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,040
evade any protections that blue team had

291
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,599
put in place

292
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
cool and do we have a scoreboard

293
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,519
available if not you can have a look

294
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,399
online

295
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,279
um

296
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,000
yes so tomorrow well the next three days

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,519
james and i well tomorrow morning james

298
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,120
and i um we're gonna have a lion um

299
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,760
it's there's not been much sleep um it's

300
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
been yes it's been intense um but we're

301
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
going to be at the booth now

302
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
we like to solve difficult problems um

303
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,120
if this ctf has inspired you if this has

304
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
inspired you to get started within ctfs

305
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
with insecurity

306
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
um

307
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,519
then please come and talk to us if you

308
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
think we could have done hard if we

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,320
could have done better if you've got an

310
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,079
idea come and talk to us it's all about

311
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,920
we just we like to solve heart problems

312
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
and so please come and discuss um

313
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
with that um did we have a scoreboard no

314
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,600
we don't but um oh no worries so we had

315
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
to uh you well i passed you just to

316
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
announce the two winners

317
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
all right cheers uh yeah a couple of

318
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,560
honorable honorable mentions at this

319
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,440
stage um for smarticus and skybound for

320
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,079
being the two highest

321
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,839
users

322
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
on the scoreboard and getting a couple

323
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,760
of flags that no one else did what are

324
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,920
you guys

325
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,440
and to that there were two flags that

326
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,480
weren't associated with ctf um no one

327
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
got the os flag so the os flag was um

328
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,160
for osint which you simply had to ask

329
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,839
iva james roy

330
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,160
what's the flag and no one asked us for

331
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,200
a flag so no one got that one um

332
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,920
so try harder on that next time and the

333
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,079
other one was elite flag did anyone get

334
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,600
the elite flag in here can anyone figure

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
out what the leaf flag was so we got

336
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
someone did you figure out what it was

337
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
