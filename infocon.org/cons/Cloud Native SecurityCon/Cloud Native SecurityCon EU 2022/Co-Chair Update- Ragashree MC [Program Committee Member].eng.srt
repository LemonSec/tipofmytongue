1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
so welcome everybody to the day two of

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
cloud native security con i hope you

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,480
enjoyed the day one yes no

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,280
awesome awesome so it takes a lot of

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,599
effort to make such a security con or

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
any event for that matter so two things

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,680
that come to my mind when we talk about

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
any event is the events team and the

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,640
technical team behind that so

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,000
kudos to our

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
events team and kudos to our attack

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
security so tag security is the

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,159
mastermind behind this event and

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,719
we are a bunch of individuals who are

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,040
focused towards

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,600
diverse backgrounds and we work towards

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,440
enabling security for the cloud native

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,879
ecosystem

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,079
and the main intention from our end is

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,559
the mission itself

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,719
is to reduce the risk that cloud native

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,520
ecosystems and applications are exposed

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
to and to reduce the risk of exposing

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
our application end user data so that is

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,680
the main intent what we have and the

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
vision that we have for today is

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
protecting the distributed systems

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
including the ecosystem entirely and

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
applications including

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
and the intent is to provide a common

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
understanding for all the members

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
included in this ecosystem starting from

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,119
the developers operators maintainers and

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,720
end users also so we do so by providing

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
a list of resources that are today

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
present in the uh

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,759
industry but also something we curate

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,720
for you

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,680
and

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
also to provide a common tooling which

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,240
you all can use in enabling your

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
security journey in the ecosystem

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,399
you can read more at our charter at

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,640

of contributors feedbacks and

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,119

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,600
interested to join us

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079

ton of materials online with cloud

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,080
native security white paper focusing on

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,878
the entirety of the ecosystem security

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,920
right from build deploy runtime and to

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,879
the end user side we have certain white

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,280
papers dedicated towards

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,840
serverless security and supply chain

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,560
security also and we have a defined

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,879
lexicon available to make sure we all

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,160
have the same understanding of the

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
