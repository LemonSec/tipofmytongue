1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,639
okay so next up we have connor rogers

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,720
and ryan gibbons and they're going to be

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,279
talking about cncf best practices for

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,400
software supply chain

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,479
thank you hello everybody

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,640
um

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,439
it's great to be here at the cncf

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,880
conference um my name is connor rogers

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,880
i'm a technology leader with celegent

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,160
systems

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,039
uh

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
we're a branch of emphasis

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,279
and we're an aws

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,160
consultancy partner and

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,440
i'm lucky enough to have gotten the

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
opportunity to work with ryan after 25

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,239
years in old school configuration

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
management build management

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
release management technical management

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,320
lean

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
agile all this kind of stuff i get the

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
opportunity to work with a security team

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,559
and 3m of which ryan is a senior leader

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,800
right ryan gibbons um it's great to work

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,079
with conor we have a lot of fun together

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,399
you'll see that while we talk today i'm

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,079
part of the 3m digital science community

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,320
so 3m is yes they make the post-it notes

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
and all the things you're used to but we

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,438
also have a technology kind of incubator

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,600
here in in dublin while i'm in spain now

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,479
but

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,320
um i started as a developer many years

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,600
ago and

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,880
then spent

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,960
a lifetime in information security so

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,159
when they said hey

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,600
security's starting to shift left back

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,759
in development i said sign me up so we

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
have a lot of fun together and we're

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,799
going to tell a little bit of story that

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,360
started a couple years ago on on how our

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
journey has progressed along this whole

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
paradigm of shifting security left and

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,680
we'll get into that in a little bit but

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
first can i find out just what how the

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
audience is distributed technical or

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
more like program so how many folks

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,600
primarily spend their time working on

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
technical problems show of hands

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
okay and how many are more like on the

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
projects and programs than the resources

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
okay so mostly technical but scattering

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,640
a few okay thank you

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,399
okay so here's here's the situation

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
framing it not particularly for 3m but

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,399
just in general um they're shifting left

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,399
again and i always like to say this is

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,719
guys this is shifting left this is not

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,960
dumping left this is not a push this

61
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
should be a pole right we will need to

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,560
give developers the tools and

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,919
the capabilities and the training and

64
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,280
everything else they need so we can move

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
this responsibly and not just have audit

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,800
and compliance go hey developers you do

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
all the stuff now

68
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
there's a huge lack of awareness in the

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
software supply chain

70
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,480
right we've been doing

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
manifests and things for many many years

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
but some people are still kind of new to

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,160
some of these things so that's okay

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
we've got um there's limited guidance

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
it's been getting better over the last

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,640
couple years but when we started this

77
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,319
journey a couple years ago it was kind

78
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,920
of sparse you could read some dod

79
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,000
documents and this had some things they

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,599
were really focused on kind of

81
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
traditional sdlc type of things but but

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,360
not necessarily the tool chain so so

83
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
there were some problems um solarwinds

84
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
raised awareness quite a bit is

85
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,560
everybody here i'm sure

86
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
is aware salsa from google also helped

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
quite a bit

88
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,080
and uh to do this we started as i

89
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
mentioned before

90
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,519
big company 3m very diverse technical

91
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
environment so a little bit challenging

92
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
lots of different groups

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,640
oh and one other thing i want to mention

94
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
here and then yeah so on the security

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
integration little circle we have there

96
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
um we had a lot of coverage in in the

97
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
whole operate right so that's the

98
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,519
traditional space where the stuff runs

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,599
and in the plans they had all these risk

100
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,840
things you had to go through and and

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
architecture reviews and everything else

102
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
but as soon as it goes to build it was

103
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,080
like just scan your code

104
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
and that seemed really it's right that's

105
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,640
right um i come from lean background

106
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,879
release management devops better faster

107
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,959
cheaper better faster cheaper let's go

108
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
faster less get us out there shorter

109
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
increments

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
and oftentimes in my career

111
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
devops was conflicted against legacy

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,319
style security organizations

113
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,720
the department of no but no

114
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,360
ryan's focus here is improve

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
the security posture of the applicant

116
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
application code delivery and what that

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,159
means is not being the department of no

118
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,120
it means

119
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,439
being department of collaboration okay

120
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,000
and first time ever i got to work in a

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,879
devops agile way with the security team

122
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,000
that builds solutions okay we like this

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
yeah yeah that makes it so much more fun

124
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,239
we get to be the builders not the no

125
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,280
people

126
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
so

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
how this worked at uh 3m we really we

128
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
knew we're kind of introducing an

129
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,600
entirely new category of of

130
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,199
considerations for senior executive

131
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,240
leadership

132
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,840
so i had to be able to tell this as a

133
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
story i had to capture their imagination

134
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
i had to get them bought into that this

135
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,639
is a thing and we're going to need to

136
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,960
spend time and prioritize the resources

137
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
away from just delivering stuff to

138
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
making sure how we deliver it is secure

139
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
so 3m knows supply chains they're very

140
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,160
good at this stuff they've seen some

141
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,680
briefings from how they do it they're

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
fantastic

143
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
so i just needed to leverage what i

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
already had and of course everything in

145
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
here you have to adapt to your own

146
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
organizations but for us it was okay

147
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,840
they understand supply chains so

148
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,240
i actually use this image when cncf

149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
released it but i had an earlier version

150
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,919
of this which wasn't as good you guys

151
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,759
know supply chain so you have materials

152
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
and you build the thing then you have to

153
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,400
deliver it to your store and then it

154
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
gets consumed

155
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
software is the same way this is new for

156
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
them because they're they don't didn't

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,240
know software quite as well software you

158
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
have components and code and you bring

159
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,520
them in and you have to compile them

160
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,280
together in a pipeline and then you you

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
know you put it into an operating

162
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,080
environment it's kind of like sending it

163
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,560
to a store so i had to use what they

164
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,520
understood and put it in terms that they

165
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
get and i knew i was being successful

166
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
when i started hearing about this in

167
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
other meetings oh yeah there's this team

168
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
doing the secure software supply chain

169
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,680
so that's how i kind of captured this

170
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
interest that we need to secure our

171
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
software supply chain just like you have

172
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,440
physical security controls yeah i'm i'm

173
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
an sclc guy i've always been sclc

174
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
and you've got to realize everybody must

175
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
realize at this stage you know it is a

176
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
complete software supply chain and a lot

177
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
of the components are coming from the

178
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,880
outside

179
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,639
and a picture tells a thousand words

180
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,160
what ryan isn't telling you here is how

181
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,199
diverse our organization is and how many

182
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,919
different stlcs we have

183
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
how many different approaches and we've

184
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,919
got some legacy and we've got some very

185
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,000
very contemporary innovative approaches

186
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
as well

187
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
and the executives

188
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
that ryan has to deal with

189
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,199
are many and diverse and they don't

190
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
often have a lot of time to

191
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
read the big document or take it in so a

192
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
picture tells a thousand words and

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
that's part of you know our knowledge

194
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,120
um

195
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
propagation upwards but also downwards

196
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
and that's very important in the space

197
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,759
that we play in yeah we had to we had to

198
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
make sure that this story was going both

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
up and down and so we actually had

200
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,120
different versions of how we would

201
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
message it depending on who our audience

202
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
was very important and we enhanced that

203
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
with the data that we had so

204
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,240
i mean

205
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
what is

206
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,680
um the critical security control number

207
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
one what's number one

208
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
you might know this one

209
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
what 20 critical controls used to be

210
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
called yeah

211
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,159
nope not firewalls good one

212
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
what's that

213
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,400
users

214
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
the user is very important to

215
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
i mean these are kind of in in all those

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
things but

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
most of

218
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,840
um what they teach you and the

219
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,039
the critical security controls is you

220
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,080
start with an inventory because you

221
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
can't protect what you don't know and

222
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
then you have to know both in hardware

223
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
and software inventory and then you kind

224
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
of go along

225
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,759
so we're like well let's follow the same

226
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,000
pattern i mean we're doing as a security

227
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,759
piece let's follow the best practices so

228
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
step number one how much code do we have

229
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
and how many components do we have in

230
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
our environment and how many build

231
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
pipelines and how many code repositories

232
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
and how many like let's let's just

233
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
identify all that

234
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
and to make it fun we kind of went to a

235
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
lot of the tech leaders and said how

236
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
much do you think you have how much how

237
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,240
much do you think you have how many code

238
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
repositories do you have how many

239
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
yeah so i really like this rhine leads

240
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
with vision okay but up above vision you

241
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
need something you need so many

242
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
principles and standards and that allows

243
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
you to be too agnostic okay you bring it

244
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
up to what does good look like let's not

245
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
worry about what the brand name or the

246
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
tool name or the

247
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
software utility name is we start up

248
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
there at that higher level yeah then we

249
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,720
can work downwards and that was a lot of

250
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
fun and so then at the end we kind of

251
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
showed how much

252
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,599
how many different types of technology

253
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,199
and how much code each group had against

254
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,360
each other it's nice to have kind of

255
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
healthy visibility i'll say not

256
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
necessarily competition but just like so

257
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
you have this much this person has this

258
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
much you thought you had a lot look at

259
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
this guy right and so having an

260
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,200
organization lover that makes him sit up

261
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,559
and pay attention oh how am i doing

262
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,399
against the people i'm having to compete

263
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,240
for resources with so we kind of got

264
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,679
into that conversation and then they

265
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,880
started using

266
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
what us and what we found as

267
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
part of the conversation so you can lead

268
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
with your threats and say this is the

269
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,440
current news this is the current hack

270
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
what's your exposure what's the

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
probability of that happening so you

272
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
have to have visibility and discovery of

273
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
your inventory your source code level at

274
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,320
your build level at your orchestrator

275
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
level at your deployment level god knows

276
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
the old uh cmdb yeah you know where has

277
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,839
it gone to

278
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,839
okay where is it on our outside and

279
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,080
indeed all of our internal tools are

280
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
critically important as well because

281
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,839
that's where the software supply chains

282
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,279
attacks are coming they're not coming on

283
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,519
your perimeter they're going inside and

284
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,279
they hit much more when they get out

285
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,600
yeah and that helps us to tie it to risk

286
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,720
so

287
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
um and we we built some reputation too

288
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
so where did we start

289
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,399
so on our team just a little bit of

290
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,399
context so i set the kind of general

291
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
scale but just for us we already had a

292
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,160
application security program we'd been

293
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
running for a while we kind of started a

294
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
new one we called it the code security

295
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,279
team because we don't deal so much with

296
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,200
the runtime environment we're just we're

297
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
all the way until you build it and then

298
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
once it's built and we secure the tool

299
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
chain and all the tests you know then

300
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
other teams are so we kind of carved our

301
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
little niche um

302
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
we'd already been

303
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
we had some resources some people we'd

304
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
already been looking at some of the best

305
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,800
practices so so that's kind of where we

306
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
were we weren't just starting out when

307
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
this document came so just a little bit

308
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
of context

309
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
from from where our journey goes in here

310
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
you'll see that you know we'd already

311
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
kind of started and we'll talk about

312
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,800
yeah so we came here to tell you a

313
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,560
little bit more about our story and how

314
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
the cncf helped us

315
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
and that's really the message that we're

316
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
here to give you is that there's a

317
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
really good artifact that people should

318
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
look at and read

319
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
and how

320
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,480
it came to us and how we were able to

321
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
leverage that yeah and how we were able

322
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,279
to communicate that to our organization

323
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,120
and we always use so while we're on this

324
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
journey so

325
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,440
we had started solarwinds came out and

326
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
really advanced the conversation and it

327
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
went from

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
my my boss and boss's boss saying so

329
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
what are you guys doing out there

330
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,560
exactly how does this relate to

331
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
so-and-so and then then it was like oh

332
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,720
solar winds right so now i was on the

333
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
table which is nice

334
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
um and then a year later we've got log

335
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,240
for j and everybody's like hey can you

336
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
guys come help so we've made a lot of

337
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
progress in the last year so there's

338
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
some cultural messages here as well so

339
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,240
ryan is a great culture leader he's got

340
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,399
a security vision he also has a good

341
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,399
security team but underneath that if

342
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
you're building solutions you've got to

343
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
have some good technologists okay so

344
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
we want to build cloud native technology

345
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
solutions that are enterprise available

346
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,760
for a vast enterprise so

347
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,560
good vision good strategy good culture

348
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
we're lean we're agile

349
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
and we got some good technologists to

350
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,480
put that kind of technology in

351
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
underneath the security best practices

352
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
not everybody is a security expert we

353
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
all can't be security experts

354
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
not everybody can be a full stack

355
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
engineer but we have to have some

356
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,519
specialists to put some meat on the bone

357
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
so we had had good people on the team

358
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,640
and a good good partnership and we

359
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,079
actually started this was our strategy

360
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,560
before the cncf best practices document

361
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
came out so this is we're going to show

362
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,279
you before and after because we um first

363
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,480
it was nice because it mapped pretty

364
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,760
well and second we made some

365
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
improvements so

366
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
we wanted to release these capabilities

367
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
so we talked about before shifting

368
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,519
security left is not dumping everything

369
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,959
on developers we wanted to build

370
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,120
capabilities that help developers to be

371
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,040
able to handle these new demands that

372
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
compliance and everybody else is putting

373
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,880
on them so we approached hey we're your

374
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,320
partners we're going to help you protect

375
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
the code in the code repositories we're

376
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
going to help you make sure you're

377
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,880
getting the right licenses we're going

378
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
to make sure you've got clean components

379
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
and have tools and capabilities and

380
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
repositories like we just heard from to

381
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,639
do that um we're gonna make sure that

382
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
the scans are done and that they're easy

383
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
and then and then get a little fuzzy at

384
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,519
the end we're like yeah and build

385
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,920
pipelines we didn't have a lot of

386
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,680
thoughts there yet because we were kind

387
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,200
of just starting that but but that we

388
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,880
knew that that was gonna be a big focus

389
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
we had some resources assigned to it so

390
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
this was our starting place it was great

391
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,519
and

392
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,760
it was early 2021 i started working with

393
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,800
ryan

394
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
he started talking to me about a

395
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
strategy and this is so appealing to me

396
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
okay it's simple and it covers a lot of

397
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
my career actually today you know but

398
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,560
it's very much a capability view at this

399
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
point and what are we going to do

400
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
protect our source code do some sca

401
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,000
scanning do some credentials discovery

402
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
use good components and then out here we

403
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,200
got

404
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
this big piece of securing the pipelines

405
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,440
yeah which we didn't have well defined

406
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
we're doing some basic things and we'll

407
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,720
talk about that a little bit and we were

408
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,160
just calling it securing our

409
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
applications

410
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
that's right that's right yeah

411
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,120
so picture tells a thousand words

412
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
okay devsecops what's devsecops what

413
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,800
does it mean across the sdlc and for me

414
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
you know it was always

415
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
can we get the code

416
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,639
from here to the customer as quickly as

417
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,480
possible was it a waterfall and then we

418
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
go agile now we can do this faster and

419
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
then in the new world okay we're taking

420
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,959
in these components we were always

421
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
taking customer off the shelf component

422
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
but now there's huge amounts of osf and

423
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,600
the attacks are coming the whole way

424
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
along here

425
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,920
i'm saying ryan you know ryan

426
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,760
you know if we're going to protect the

427
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
front door we've got to stop the stuff

428
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
coming in at the back door let's protect

429
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
our ingestion boundaries so i drew this

430
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,279
picture and i tried to make it

431
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,000
principles and standards based

432
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and agnostic

433
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
and agnostic and we needed a map to have

434
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,600
these conversations because we jump in

435
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,199
and go okay remember this part in the

436
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,480
pipeline we need to start talking about

437
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
that and people would just like have the

438
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,399
people in the room just check out okay

439
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,720
let's build the map um we'll get input

440
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
from other people and uh didn't get as

441
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
much input as we thought they were just

442
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
like yeah okay that's i mean we could we

443
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
can have conversations here you've got

444
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
some major processes we didn't want to

445
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,480
make it too detailed and we didn't make

446
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
want to make it too high level so we

447
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
tried to find the right way that we knew

448
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,519
how to talk about where to put the

449
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
security pieces so

450
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,120
we found we developed we found we could

451
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
we could talk to the waterfall guys we

452
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
could talk to the agile guys you can

453
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,399
actually fit a container pipeline in

454
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
here yeah which we have yeah so this was

455
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
our our map and we have our security

456
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
services across the top this is how

457
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,600
we're trying to communicate to people

458
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
well how we fit in to the work that

459
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
they're doing so this was our starting

460
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,839
point

461
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,800
and then

462
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
well you know so we were discussing all

463
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
this and we're just about to launch two

464
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,120
of the processes

465
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
and

466
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
well joe biden uh his executive cyber

467
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,279
security order we better go and have a

468
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,800
good look at this

469
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
and i think everybody probably knows

470
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
broadly what's in there you know protect

471
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,839
the federal government protect the

472
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,079
infrastructure there's a big section in

473
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,000
it called secure software supply chains

474
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
and this is in response to solar winds

475
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,000
um

476
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,079
and of course then it's the s-bomb the

477
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,839
s-bomb i've been doing builds and

478
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,600
materials for a long time generally

479
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
they're in your make file or your

480
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
manifest

481
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,079
do you check on the other end and do you

482
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
a test do you verify so this is a

483
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
standard space desk bomb okay one that's

484
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,279
transferable and interchangeable and

485
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,959
this gave us some leverage because 3m

486
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,320
does a lot of business with the federal

487
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
government and other defense departments

488
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,839
and stuff and we're saying guys they're

489
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,759
taking this very seriously we need to

490
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,360
make sure we're staying ahead of the

491
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
game because you never want to be caught

492
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
behind where they're like i need this by

493
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
next month and you're like well we don't

494
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,560
do that yet

495
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,079
so we need to make sure we deliver

496
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,199
whatever it is that they look like

497
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
they're going to ask for it and i'm like

498
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
oh hey we've already got plans for these

499
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,120
things yeah absolutely um it's i'm not a

500
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,920
security guy at that stage well i am but

501
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,440
i think everybody should be a security

502
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,279
guy i think everybody should be a devops

503
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,199
guy it's not that guy over there is full

504
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
we're all in this game together

505
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,279
and it's resonating with me

506
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,560
and we're going

507
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,399
hang on we've been trying to get ahead

508
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
of this game and they're talking about

509
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,079
what happens next

510
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,959
this well two days later

511
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,519
two days later this wonderful document

512
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,160
drops from the cncf

513
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
and i'm doing my normal examination of

514
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,720
what's new in the world of hacking and

515
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,040
software supply chains the document

516
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,920
comes out it is a wonderful document

517
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
i read it i said to ryan i said ryan you

518
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,759
know we're not that far off you know

519
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,360
we got to put some more meat in the bone

520
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,800
but look what we're just after getting

521
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,440
here from the cncf document so

522
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,199
recommended reading for everybody in the

523
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,519
room

524
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
so what is it about and for me it's

525
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
about

526
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
principles and standards at the high

527
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
level there's really good governance

528
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
there's really good principles about

529
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,039
your risk environments your risk

530
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,000
appetite but general principles of trust

531
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
trust at every stage

532
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
and every job in the pipeline so

533
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,199
attestation and verification

534
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
it's high on that it's also high on

535
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,599
automation better faster cheaper better

536
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,520
faster cheaper no no

537
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,599
better faster cheaper and more secure

538
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,240
okay so that you have consistency

539
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
the investment in automation

540
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
is paid back later because you have

541
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,480
consistency less effort it's automated

542
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,799
clarity at every stage know where it

543
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,600
happens control that environment

544
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
build nodes as we heard earlier on

545
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,840
hardening your pipelines

546
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
you must be able to reproduce the build

547
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
at any time and anybody else who needs

548
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,760
to do it

549
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,520
people think often you know oh we'll

550
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,120
move the source code system from here to

551
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,679
here yeah we'll just lift and shift it

552
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
no you've got to bring the pipelines the

553
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,679
processes and all the builds with them

554
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,799
which means okay bit for bit by bite

555
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,559
your artifact at the end has to be the

556
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,880
same before and after that migration so

557
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,679
clarity is really important

558
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
and then of course the mfa mutual

559
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
authentication

560
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
every step of the way everybody needs to

561
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,480
be authorized and accessed and certified

562
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,200
so

563
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
that's critical okay

564
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,000
so what does the document actually have

565
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
in it

566
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,600
and lo and behold it breaks down the

567
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,240
software supply chain

568
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
securing your source code protect your

569
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,919
code at rest

570
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,480
okay so there's 22 good principles in

571
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,000
there that everybody should be looking

572
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,799
at

573
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,919
how to secure the integrity of your code

574
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,840
your access to your code the integrity

575
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,760
of your environments and there's some

576
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,600
pretty high bars that you would have to

577
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,559
meet

578
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
signing your source code with gpg and

579
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,679
mime keys

580
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,360
it's difficult for some systems to

581
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
achieve

582
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
yeah and and also in these controls that

583
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
each of the sections have or each of the

584
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
the statements or requirements there's

585
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,360
different levels what would you do if

586
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,640
you're just trying to low and this is

587
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,320
kind of like for public people public

588
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,799
repositories for medium

589
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,559
or moderate levels which would be more

590
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,799
like internal system confidential types

591
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,360
of things and then high which would be

592
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,679
missile systems air traffic control

593
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,000
banking phi data

594
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,240
okay and some of these are high bar to

595
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
achieve and when you assess that you

596
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,840
look at it and don't forget all the

597
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
branch protections and all those

598
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,799
configuration source code management 101

599
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,480
stuff it's all there but called out and

600
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,120
clear principles to remind us

601
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,039
next action is securing the materials so

602
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,720
you have your source code

603
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,000
and you have all your materials where

604
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,400
your materials come from okay so a lot

605
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
of oss and probably some cuts off the

606
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
shelf tools as well

607
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,919
okay so attestation sca analysis s-bombs

608
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,440
from your vendors

609
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,160
and again verification automation all

610
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
the way through some really good

611
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,400
practices there i think 33.

612
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
um when you get down into securing your

613
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
build pipelines

614
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
that's a great section of the document

615
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,000
everybody should read it on the

616
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,720
presentation earlier on uh securing your

617
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,039
build pipelines with kubernetes and

618
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,120
techton yeah i think they're hitting a

619
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,200
lot of the battles there but that you

620
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
know what we're talking about is

621
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
immutable pipelines okay so that nobody

622
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
can get in the administrator is not

623
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
getting in there and changing it on the

624
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,280
fly we don't want any snowflakes and we

625
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
want to have build workers that are

626
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,919
reproducible continuously typically now

627
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,919
in a container that you can spin it up

628
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,360
and it is

629
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
certified as well so in total is big

630
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,080
here big recommendation

631
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,280
very high bar to reach but we're going

632
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
hang on let's not let perfect get in the

633
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
way better okay it's a journey we're on

634
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
this journey three amazon this journey

635
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,960
digital transformation is a journey

636
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,120
we have to go there but don't be put off

637
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,679
by some of that really high level stuff

638
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,600
measure your risk appetite to where you

639
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,720
are well that's part of how we'd

640
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
recommend using this is find the ones

641
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
that work for your organization you

642
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
don't want it to be too far of a reach

643
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,280
you also don't want to make it too easy

644
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,360
so we spent a lot of time like a

645
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,200
moderate plus maybe this one in this one

646
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,760
or you know security artifacts at the

647
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,440
end of the build okay so you got your

648
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,280
build you got your manufacturer put it

649
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,679
in a repo okay put a checksum on it put

650
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,520
a hash on it promote it to your qa

651
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
environments make sure that it's the

652
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,919
same one with the same license and all

653
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,000
the same code in it that your team

654
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,960
actually

655
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,880
released promote that through your

656
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
environment do your unit test system

657
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,240
test integration test performance test

658
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
all your tests when you're ready to go

659
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,000
you might bring it closer to a target

660
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
environment

661
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,799
that's where it should come from just

662
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,880
your cd is taking it and putting it out

663
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,760
there and then the last piece the cd

664
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
okay make sure and we've spoken already

665
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,760
today about the tuf framework it's big

666
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,919
on the tuf framework there so

667
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,440
attestation

668
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
verification

669
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,919
clarity trust every step in the way and

670
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,720
then

671
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,440
least privilege and separation of duties

672
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,159
and reproducibility and automation

673
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,159
this is goldust this document

674
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,440
okay very good so conor what did you do

675
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
when the document came out well i had to

676
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
read it a few times

677
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,559
and actually

678
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,400
i read it a couple of times since i left

679
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
dublin we're both in dublin here at the

680
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
moment and this is lightroom every time

681
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,400
i read it i was really not i get i get a

682
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,919
new one and it's just going i have to

683
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,520
think about that again you know what are

684
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,159
we going to do so what do we do

685
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,240
but you broke it out i did i parsed it

686
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
out into clauses and i put the clauses

687
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
into categories and he's like ryan check

688
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
this out i've got this whole thing in a

689
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,240
big spreadsheet for you i'm like

690
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
yeah absolutely and then ryan goes

691
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,559
well that's amazing and that's good but

692
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,000
hang on how are we going to make this

693
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
work for 3m yeah because 3m has its own

694
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
culture and its own vernacular right

695
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,200
okay and we got to translate that into

696
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
the words people commonly use

697
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,240
book we had a framework okay so

698
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,159
it gave us a good reference it told us

699
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,000
where we were weak told us where we were

700
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,440
strong it told us some bits that we

701
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,720
hadn't covered

702
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
so and then we took we took those

703
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,919
phrases those different pieces we

704
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,360
simplified the language a little bit to

705
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,880
make it more consumable

706
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,799
and then we went we we kind of put it in

707
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,159
the controls list and i'm like i've done

708
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,640
this before i've done this looks like a

709
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,799
controls framework so i put it on the

710
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,799
bottom you see i put control objectives

711
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,240
and numberings on there and who's the

712
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,440
owner and evidence required and

713
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,640
everything else we just start filling it

714
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,320
out like this and and it was quite

715
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,600
enlightening as we went through we

716
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,679
started seeing a lot of patterns and

717
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,280
and we had some great discussions when

718
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,960
we came up with what evidence what would

719
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
we expect someone to give us if they

720
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
were going to meet this control and

721
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,320
these would be this would be targeted

722
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
more for the tool chain owners and less

723
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,440
towards the application owners right

724
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
so

725
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,279
absolutely and then you know audit

726
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,000
control policy these are big hammers

727
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,760
that you can bring into an organization

728
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,840
but we're a team that likes solutions

729
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,039
yeah okay

730
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,960
we do not want to leave how good are our

731
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,559
current solutions

732
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
uh how do they measure up against this

733
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
yeah you know

734
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,559
which ones how do these different tool

735
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,919
sets measure up against each other

736
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,240
because we would like to converge but

737
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
not necessarily be completely rigid and

738
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,240
and how not to make friends is to come

739
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,679
in with this real hard requirement that

740
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,679
there's no tool to be able to do yet and

741
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,360
say go figure it out right that's a

742
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
terrible position but yeah your baby is

743
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
ugly yeah don't do that we're like let's

744
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,640
let's find out what we can do and then

745
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
we're going to work with the tool owners

746
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,880
and we come to them and we're going to

747
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,679
say

748
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,120
our job right now is to make you the

749
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,480
gold standard for the company we're

750
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,000
going to try to get you up to that level

751
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,679
so so work with us for a few months

752
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,880
we're going to do an assessment of your

753
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,400
tool find out where we're deficient see

754
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,840
if we can get some items on the backlog

755
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,279
and see if we can get these things fixed

756
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,400
for the different tools that are

757
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,159
supporting this out there and the

758
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,080
natural way that conversation worked is

759
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,679
after they saw that initial pass they're

760
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,760
either oh yeah okay well that's doable

761
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,600
we can we can fix those things and we'll

762
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
secure this pipeline or

763
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,120
yeah our technology we just can't do

764
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,240
that

765
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
we're going to decommission this and

766
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
move to some one of the more modern ones

767
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,159
which is great i didn't have to be the

768
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
bad guy we're just like hey yeah they'll

769
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
admit to it you know but respectful

770
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
conversations transparent conversations

771
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
collaboration partnership really

772
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
important but we do come in with the

773
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,000
know-how and the show how the show has

774
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,840
how do you actually prove that you uh

775
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,159
rotate your keys yeah you know so here's

776
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,679
a couple examples of how we do this and

777
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
we can get into more detail if we if

778
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
people want to get it have questions

779
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
later but here's two of them i just

780
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,440
pulled out

781
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,679
one's a little fudged because i why

782
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,880
first i had to get this through legal

783
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,960
review and second i didn't have a lot of

784
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
screen space i wouldn't just put this

785
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,400
together so first one would be securing

786
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
your source code so are you doing secret

787
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,919
scanning or preventing secrets from

788
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,559
getting in well secrets preventing um

789
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,400
false positives cause problems and we're

790
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
still working on the prevention part but

791
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,159
we said for right now let's just make

792
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,679
sure we've got scanning

793
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,840
make sure that it's um measuring stuff

794
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
that's on and that developers are

795
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,960
getting these findings and it's going to

796
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,240
the vulnerability team too so they can

797
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,080
help track that that's where we want to

798
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,360
be for right now

799
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,679
um the lucky person who's the owner

800
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
would be the owner of the github or tfs

801
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,080
or whatever technology was doing this

802
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,039
and we would make sure the secret

803
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,440
scanner is working so i can report on

804
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,559
their stewardship of that technology

805
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,400
yeah and we're not bringing somebody

806
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
like to shine the lights into their eyes

807
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,919
you know we're saying

808
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
tell us how we can help you improve this

809
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
should you be doing that or is this a

810
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
service we should provide you so you can

811
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,360
do this right that's the approach so

812
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,440
second one securing materials software

813
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
composition analysis those are like your

814
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
black ducks and some types and other

815
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,159
things

816
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,559
you can either integrate black duck or

817
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,240
whatever tool into your pipeline and

818
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,600
make sure that scans happening every

819
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,480
time

820
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,320
or you just have to get your stuff like

821
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
they just mentioned from artifactory or

822
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,919
nexus that's already been wrapped and

823
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,600
approved and nothing gets in unless it's

824
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,799
approved and so as long as you're

825
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,400
pulling your stuff from that then you

826
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,159
meet this control so this is kind of the

827
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,320
approach that we took on how we get the

828
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,480
evidence and it depends on you know

829
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
obviously this is subdivided and there's

830
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
multiple a little bit more complicated

831
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,840
but the other groups don't need to see

832
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,960
that they just need to know we've got it

833
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
organized and it's by a person who can

834
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
actually make it also you also

835
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
interleave some of that with some

836
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
standard controls that we actually have

837
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
for logging and monitoring and

838
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,400
everything we also had to

839
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
move some pieces around a little bit

840
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
because we had a two year strategy and

841
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
we didn't want to go ah no it's

842
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
what we had we wanted to tin our

843
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,919
strategy at the top

844
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,440
and then have those capabilities

845
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,799
underneath so

846
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,720
for example uh

847
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,279
das scanning we can put that scanning

848
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,399
into merge clean components okay or

849
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,399
possibly in the qa

850
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,120
however sca we put it there and also

851
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,840
yeah i think ryan

852
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
um the building artifacts the storing

853
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,000
the artifacts and clean deployments

854
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,320
that's a lot to take in for somebody so

855
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
we crushed that into yeah

856
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
we'll talk about that in just a sec in

857
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
fact maybe i'll skip to it now

858
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,360
so we

859
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
i'll skip to the strategy and we'll talk

860
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,960
about how it helped but we took the

861
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
structure that they had and kind of used

862
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,799
it to simplify so

863
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,279
um you know secure build and deploy

864
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,120
became we kind of merged a couple of

865
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,520
those in and and now we have definitions

866
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,880
behind all of it like i know how to

867
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,159
assess people against those different

868
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,279
things that's your software build

869
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,799
materials certified build pipeline

870
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,520
certified delivery mechanisms all those

871
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
things and we just simplified the

872
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
strategy in general because

873
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
you know license and components were

874
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,360
kind of

875
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
you know they merged it in the

876
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
in the the

877
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,240
best practices document like oh yeah

878
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
that makes a lot of sense so it helped

879
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
us to simplify our message we aligned it

880
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
with the best practices document and and

881
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
this is really easy to communicate to

882
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
executives i can go in and say here's

883
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,600
what a software secure software supply

884
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,360
chain looks like you have these pieces

885
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,799
by the way here's our strategy you

886
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,919
implement this and you have a secure

887
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,440
software supply chain and they just go

888
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,480
boom

889
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
great what do you need i mean it's a

890
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,799
much easier conversation it is they they

891
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,080
ask us to come there because something

892
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,000
like log4j happens and it's so nice when

893
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,919
you've got this plan and i know how much

894
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,360
the time it's going to take

895
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,799
we we didn't get into this but we can

896
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,360
talk about um you know resources and

897
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
roi for this and the costs we've had

898
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,240
together

899
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
ryan deeply understands how to get that

900
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
message up there what does value mean

901
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
security costs

902
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,760
okay but it also reduces costs okay if

903
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
you have automated security you can

904
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,080
prove reduced costs

905
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,600
your ci your cfo may not understand stlc

906
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
and the secure software supply chain but

907
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,360
he can understand our supply chain and

908
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,960
he can understand cost reduction and

909
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,279
effort yeah and that's a big one so with

910
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,720
this one thing i found really really

911
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
helpful is to actually get good

912
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,480
estimates on how much time it would take

913
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,559
to do this manually or how much time it

914
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,880
would be if you can automate this and i

915
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,320
we actually put that into hours and we

916
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
deliver that monthly and it was really

917
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,440
painful at the beginning but as you do

918
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,720
anything you iterate on it you get

919
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,399
better at it and better at it so now i

920
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,120
can sew every month both legacy projects

921
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,399
we kind of get a residual because it

922
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,080
still helps those but any new project

923
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,520
that comes in i'm like if you were to do

924
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,720
this manually would have taken you this

925
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,799
long our tools do it in this much time

926
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,960
right it's automated and the cfos love

927
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,159
that kind of stuff because they're like

928
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,679
well i can spend money because i see my

929
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,520
roi here and it's it's legitimate they

930
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,720
have to do it either way you might as

931
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,559
well do it the fast easy automated way

932
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,559
and we're helping you do that absolutely

933
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,559
and remember i mentioned the old style

934
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,919
cmdb

935
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,840
that was fine when you had 20 servers

936
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,679
but now we've got containers with very

937
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,520
short life cycles so this dynamic

938
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
inventory of where is it where has it

939
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,520
gone to how did it get there if you have

940
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,919
your operations teams continue trying to

941
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,840
figure out what's out there and they

942
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,600
don't know because there's been no trail

943
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,520
back no audit trail

944
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,840
no release note with the s-bomb where

945
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
did it go to

946
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,760
that's your cost saving right there

947
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
so we've talked about how we only have a

948
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,240
couple minutes left we've talked about

949
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,080
how it really helped having this best

950
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,000
practices document come and reinforce

951
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,440
our strategy and how we could leverage

952
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,960
an industry standard and we were talking

953
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
to all these tool owners and i mean it

954
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,520
was just really nice in that perspective

955
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
um but i just want to end with this yeah

956
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,960
so

957
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,320
here's some advice some lessons learned

958
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,440
along the way

959
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
we did not do everything right in fact i

960
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,159
bet some of the stuff we're doing now is

961
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,360
wrong so if you have ideas we'd love to

962
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,399
hear from them

963
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,559
um we just we learn and we fail and we

964
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,480
do better next time but

965
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,159
we're open and transparent right we're

966
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,840
open on transparent we like making new

967
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,519
mistakes that's right don't make the

968
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,440
same mistakes

969
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
create these alliances a partnership

970
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,559
like we're never trying to embarrass

971
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,919
teams we always want to give people

972
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,600
plenty of time before the results are

973
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,559
published

974
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,200
um before anything comes to you know so

975
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
we always work with the groups trying to

976
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,080
get things up before

977
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,240
other people find out about it and

978
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
absolutely we we don't want to crush

979
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,440
them into a corner and we want people to

980
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
be open with us so we're very respectful

981
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,960
we understand their problems from a

982
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,720
security perspective and from a

983
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,799
development perspective but we want them

984
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,480
to acknowledgement as the first part of

985
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
that journey yeah and we've made lots of

986
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
friends along the way i mean it's this

987
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,640
is ultimately i'm convinced a culture

988
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,799
change it's a culture change for how

989
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,480
developers do their work in a lot of

990
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,720
cases for how managers prioritize the

991
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,279
work and for how people pay for software

992
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
i mean there was a paradigm especially

993
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,320
in some of the acquisitions where it's

994
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,919
like hey we're just going to do

995
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,519
um you know we're going to do things

996
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,039
really agile we're going to use all free

997
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,480
software and it's going to be super

998
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,760
cheap and we don't have to pay for

999
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,519
licenses that way we could just be fast

1000
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,120
and we're like um

1001
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,480
okay well show me how you meet these

1002
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,760
requirements with this thing you've

1003
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,080
cobbled together over a weekend

1004
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,360
and so if you're gonna meet all these

1005
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,039
security requirements it's better to use

1006
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,559
on one of the items on what we call the

1007
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,919
paved road right if you use this

1008
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,320
technology and this component management

1009
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,000
and this pipeline and these things we

1010
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,279
will do your

1011
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,200
compliance stuff for you because it's

1012
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,360
all already automated if you do it by

1013
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,960
yourself i'm gonna need all these

1014
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
deliverables all this evidence to show

1015
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
me that you're doing it and so it kind

1016
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,679
of restricts

1017
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,640
um

1018
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,159
to people adding risk because they're

1019
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,679
doing it on their own way a little bit

1020
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,440
and and also gets more engagement in the

1021
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,720
big processes because if those aren't

1022
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,840
working for them they need to give that

1023
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,000
feedback so we can add the features and

1024
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,600
so we don't come in with the policy

1025
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,080
framework and say no no no this is wrong

1026
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,720
we'll come in with a paved road okay we

1027
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,120
build solutions and we go how about this

1028
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
way over here look you know this is the

1029
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,679
way it works and guess what leaders lead

1030
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,519
those who want to follow we want

1031
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,200
everybody to be security they'll come

1032
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,880
with us there will be an ugly tale

1033
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,039
perhaps but guess what

1034
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,279
you know policy will harden as we

1035
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,120
improve behind us

1036
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,039
and then you know we're making it easier

1037
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,679
for developers to do the right thing and

1038
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,320
not as ryan says dumping to the left

1039
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,600
yeah we're not dumping to the left it's

1040
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,799
all about people

1041
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,640
um these are professionals they want to

1042
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
do what's right if you show them the

1043
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,919
right way to do it we've found that they

1044
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,919
just love it they're very grateful for

1045
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,679
hey good thank you for letting me know

1046
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,880
exactly what was needed giving me the

1047
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,799
tools to do it all right i haven't found

1048
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,039
anyone in 3m that's like nah i want to

1049
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,760
do things insecure like nobody says that

1050
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,600
they're they they say well i'd like to

1051
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,799
do that but i'm getting all these

1052
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,480
business pressure right so we can give

1053
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,919
them some air cover by talking to their

1054
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,360
executives and making sure that they've

1055
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,080
got the air cover and and also well what

1056
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,200
you're asking to do is really really

1057
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
hard can you help make it easy yeah we

1058
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,000
can do that

1059
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,760
and if you do that we've found that we

1060
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,360
have really great results and it's been

1061
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,039
a great journey and conor is legitimate

1066
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,799

1070
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480

1079
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,520
question

1080
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,960

1081
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,520
talking to us after then

1082
