1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,680
thank you so much

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,560
my name is shaoli i'm the ceo of armo

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,720
and we are the company behind the open

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,040
source cubescape um i know it was

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,559
mentioned in one of the earlier talks

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,080
today around

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,679
tools that you can use to scan your

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,280
kubernetes cluster against different

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
frameworks and misconfigurations

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
and it has been used quite

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,760
frequently in the last

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
year or so and we've scanned

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
well we've scanned over 20 clusters to

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,439
date but when we reached the 10 000

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,760
clusters we wanted to do this analysis

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,960
of you know what we've learned what

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
we're seeing in the industry and i

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
wanted to share that with you

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
um so first of all what have we looked

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
at we've looked at the data set of 10

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
000 clusters 48

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
of the users

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,879
were in north america and 33 were in

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,719
europe and the rest were in emir and

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,840
apac

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,320
if we think about cluster sizes uh we

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,239
see that 35

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,879
let's say even almost 70 percent

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,079
of clusters had less than 10 nodes up to

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,359
10 nodes and about 6 percent and over 50

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,720
nodes

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
what we see in terms of trends is that

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,920
we see

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
clusters getting larger and larger

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,119
what is not here and also we've seen is

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,400
like the number of clusters per user it

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
is also growing um i think like five

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
percent of the users had more than 25

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,479
clusters which i personally think it's

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,200
it's way uh too much but i do think like

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
there is this kind of like notion

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,759
of the trade-off between the size of the

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,840
cluster and the number of clusters and

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,400
how uh you wanna manage it uh so we see

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
that in the data quite uh quite often

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,640
in terms of job titles we see that 57

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
of the users

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
are devops users

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
which might be surprising to some but i

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,119
hope that it's not

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,880
because it is a security tool and many

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
people have this misconceptions that

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
devops don't care about security

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,159
actually in a gartner

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,479
research lately it was told that

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,600
actually

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,759
30 percent of organizations when when

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,000
they were asked who is in charge of the

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,119
kubernetes security said that devops do

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,599
that and we can see it in our data

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,879
24 of the users are security engineers

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
security architects um security people

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,200
who are hands-on and who are in the

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
in the material

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
and five percent uh devsecops which is

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
something that that we see of course

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
more and more

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,360
um we scan usually across different

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,840
frameworks of security uh the meter

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
attack framework that was developed by

71
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
the media organization and was adjusted

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
to kubernetes by microsoft the nsa and

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,239
cisa guidance for kubernetes security uh

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,239
that was issued by the nsa

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,760
the alma best practices which is

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
basically a framework that we took the

77
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,319
most important parts of those two and

78
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,160
took them together and then there is

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
devote best practices which is basically

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,879
an enhanced version of those security

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,400
methods but also to non-security

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
checks so for example if you're running

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,360
without a liveliness probe it's probably

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
uh a bad practice in terms of devops but

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,720
it's not really a security issue um so

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
these are the type of controls that we

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
had there what we've seen

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
is that there is a there is a very large

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,599
of course um correlation between your

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,440
score and all of them so it's not that

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
the nsa and the metria are very

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,720
different in what they assess if you are

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
bad in one you're bad in all that's

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,319
basically what we've seen

95
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
um and another best practice is to keep

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,120
your score below 30. you need to fix to

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
continue fix fixing things and when you

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,959
get below 30 that's usually a place

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,959
where you're in a good position if you

100
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,640
are below 10 you're going to work best

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,680
10

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
and if you're above 60 you're in the

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
worst five percent of clusters that

104
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,280
we've seen

105
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
in terms of the top five

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,439
misconfigurations that we see

107
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,200
in the market that we see

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
out there

109
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,599
it is run privileged containers cluster

110
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,080
admin binding missing resources policies

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
we'll talk about that in a minute and

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
not using immutable container file

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
systems which is very hard to do it's

114
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
hard to use and i understand why many

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
people don't do that and not you and not

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
blocking the ingress and the egress of a

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
micro service that is not supposed to be

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
open to the internet now 100

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,160
of clusters had at least one issue and

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,479
that's not surprising because you know

121
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,360
how

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
you know complicated kubernetes

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
configuration can be but also it is

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
because uh some misconfigurations are

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
okay you can live with them and fixing

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,360
them can get you more pain than actually

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
solving them and that's okay you don't

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
have to be perfect

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,520
um what is more concerning is that at

130
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,759
least 65 percent of clusters had at

131
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
least one high severity uh

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
misconfiguration which is something like

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
running in privileged mode or allowing

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
previous escalations within the

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
container or maybe having credentials

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
application credentials

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,680
in your file system in your container

138
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
configuration

139
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
so now i go into a little bit of the

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
detail of that

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,120
not having a proper limitation 63

142
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,479
percent of the clusters did not have um

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,120
workload limited in terms of cpu and

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
memory and that's a bad practice both in

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
terms of of just best practice in terms

146
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
of resource utilization but also

147
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,800
security wise coin miners different

148
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,039
applications that are going to utilize a

149
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
cpu and memory and you want to limit

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,039
them as much as you can

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
the the second part is secrets secrets

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
and configuration files we see it it's

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
not one of the top ones okay like the

154
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
top ones were all 60 or more

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,720
of clusters but but still 37 of clusters

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,520
add

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
application credentials or misplace

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
secrets in configuration file usually

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,039
what we see is the aws access keys you

160
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,680
know s3 buckets keys and and i

161
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
understand why developers sometimes do

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
that it's the easiest place to put it in

163
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
but of course it is a very problematic

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
in terms of how to do it

165
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
security wise

166
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,960
risky capabilities

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
what we've seen is that many many

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,000
workloads uh well at least relatively 23

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
and 35 percent of workloads are running

170
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
with either

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,240
insecure or dangerous capabilities

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
um we see here on the on the right the

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,360
different capabilities that we look at

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
the most problematic ones are

175
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
in this red triangles the net admin and

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
the net row and this admin and we see

177
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,120
not uh

178
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
you know it's not negligible it is a

179
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
significant number of clusters that are

180
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,319
running with workloads with these

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,840
capabilities that they don't need to

182
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,919
finally

183
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,800
vulnerabilities misconfigurations always

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,199
go together with vulnerabilities and

185
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,759
what we've seen is well 44 percent of

186
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
the vulnerabilities that we've seen were

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
medium 21 were critical 35 percent were

188
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:09,919
high

189
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,400
um in terms of critical vulnerabilities

190
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
35

191
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
of clusters add at least one

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
critical vulnerability in one of the

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
workloads

194
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,520
and

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,319
six percent at more than six

196
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,199
um of course the critical

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,479
vulnerabilities are the things that we

198
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,720
are most concerned about but we also

199
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
always need to think about them in

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,759
conjunction with

201
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,680
misconfigurations because the reality is

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,039
if you think about the vulnerability and

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,360
this is a critical vulnerability it made

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,520
a lot of noise in 2021 uh even early

205
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,400
2022 i think

206
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,199
and it was about being able to escalate

207
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,080
and penetrate kubernetes clusters

208
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
via

209
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,240
vulnerability in the container

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
runtime

211
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,680
the thing is that finding that

212
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
vulnerability is great

213
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
but even if you are vulnerable with this

214
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
vulnerability if you put the right

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
controls if you didn't allow privileged

216
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
container to run if you didn't allow

217
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
previous escalation within the

218
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
configuration of that container

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
even if you have that vulnerability you

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,319
are not

221
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,599
um

222
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
it's not exploitable it's very hard to

223
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
exploit by the user by by the attacker

224
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
and that's why we think

225
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
it is very very important to actually

226
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,240
take the two together and you know we

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
are in cncf and we talk a lot about

228
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,639
roadmap that's exactly the next thing on

229
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,679
our roadmap like cross referencing your

230
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,080
misconfigurations and vulnerabilities

231
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,159
and actually understanding whether that

232
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
vulnerability is relevant whether it is

233
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,799
exploitable right now in your current

234
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,200
system so this is what we do and this is

235
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,399
how we do it

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,680
um

237
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
yes do you have a question

238
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
one minute so let's see if in one minute

239
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
i can show you how to get a scan running

240
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,040
very very quickly

241
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
let's go here

242
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,880
don't look at my gmail for a minute

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,800
no i'm not going to do it in one minute

244
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,959
but okay all you need to do is go to

245
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,800
cubescape

246
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,439
in github

247
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
okay

248
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
you use this one liner

249
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,040
you just copy it

250
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
into any machine where you have a cube

251
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
ctl access to your cluster you run it

252
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
less than three minutes later you will

253
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
have your first report that tells you

254
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
right there in the standard output where

255
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,959
you pass and fail for each one of those

256
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
configuration tests and you can go into

257
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
at the end you have a link to a nice ui

258
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
that you can log into and see also

259
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,600
vulnerabilities and

260
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
from there you can do many many things

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
so thank you so much it was 10 minutes

262
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
but i hope

263
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,020
i got it across thank you so much

264
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,699
[Applause]
