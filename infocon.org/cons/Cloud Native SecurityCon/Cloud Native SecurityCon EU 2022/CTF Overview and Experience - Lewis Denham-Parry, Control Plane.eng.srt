bring up and raise up mental health um i

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,079
suffer from depression i know i'm not

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
the only one who does and the last

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,600
couple of years i understand we're going

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,840
to hear a lot about it but equally just

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,760
be aware of today as well there's a bit

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
of like seeing so many people standing

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
up on stage like i remember when i went

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,600
to my first conference and i was sat in

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
the room and it felt like right i'm the

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
imposter here i don't have a clue what

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
anyone's talking about we're here to

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,400
learn and so please just remember that

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,560
oh just drink water take a breath if you

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760

so it's

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,680
you might have realized that these

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,119
slides what might have been made on

41
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,840
transit here um there's a couple of us

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,119

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,880

james is a mastermind behind the

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,560
majority of a ctf he is absolutely

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,040
phenomenal um so it's definitely someone

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
you need to check out and finally does

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
anyone know who andrew martin is

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
okay we got a couple of hands all right

55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
um if you see andrew please tell me

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,119
where he is because i'll be really

57
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,119
useful right now but andy um he's the

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,119
ceo of control plane he was my

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
inspiration i he gave a talk about five

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
years ago where he did live hacking on

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
stage and i was like that is

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,399
not going to swear that's the stuff i

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,159
would like to be able to do so that's

64
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,199
why i'm here today

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,640
so previously in life um

66
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
i was a software developer for a while

67
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
and well before that before i was a

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
software developer i was a kid i think

69
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,280
we've all been kids and

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
i really enjoyed solving problems

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
whether it be a jigsaw whether it be

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,040
whatever i don't know i went jigsaw but

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
computer games and such i loved just

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
solving problems and that's what led me

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
into computers

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
back in 1999 i didn't understand what

77
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
kubernetes is and i kind of don't really

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,599
understand what it is now but that's why

79
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
we're here um but it was this problem

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
solving which led me to my job which is

81
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
also a hobby but i was an application

82
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
developer and i was a developer because

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,599
security scared the hell out of me

84
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,920
i like clearly defined boundaries i like

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
to say that i've done a good job here i

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
i like that security for me was like

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
well i've secured is it secure i don't

88
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
know

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
but then that realization with age came

90
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,760
that actually it's just another problem

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
for me to solve so that's why i'm i'm

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
here today

93
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
so hands up time who's here at this

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,159

all right now everyone's got their hands

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,879
up see so like for me lan parties were

100
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,319
uh quake counter strike um halo

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,239

102
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
like to shout out now

103
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
unreal tournament thank you for oh yes

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,519
dude how you doing hey guys um

105
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,599
yeah great but for me it was about that

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,280
community aspect it's not just playing

107
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
the game like i remember us like taking

108
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
all our like cables to this house like

109
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
someone someone rented a flat we're like

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,360
whoa you've rented a flat and then we

111
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
went into their flat so many tv ah it

112
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,000
was a mess but it was so much fun and

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
then that was like our original meetup

114
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,439
that's where we had so much pizza

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
so much like that's where we first found

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
beer like it was phenomenal

117
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
and that's where we come to today so

118
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,680
again just back to problem solving there

119
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
um that's what i see as ctfs like ctfs

120
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
uh

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
ctfs for me even though with its capture

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,959
flag let me go to the next slide because

123
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,200
again transit apologies um a ctf capture

124
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,199
flag the purpose of this is is to find a

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,440
flag and that's an upset objective

126
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
that's clearly defining our boundaries

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,479
we know we're going into a cluster and

128
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
we need to find this flag

129
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,320
now equally when i first did my ctf i've

130
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
never done a ctf before i don't know

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
what i'm doing i feel like imposter

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
syndrome kicking in like i shouldn't be

133
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
here i don't have a clue

134
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
nah

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
that's what we're going to do today so

136
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,639
we're going to give you access to a ctf

137
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
anyone done ctfs before first of all

138
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
before i'm teaching you all how to suck

139
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
eggs which is something from the uk

140
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,639
which doesn't make any sense to anyone

141
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,080
outside of the uk

142
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,520
please do not suck any eggs um

143
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
so

144
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
with ctf it gives us this learning

145
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
objective it allows us to be it just

146
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
performing the role of red team as an

147
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
attacker it allows us to do that fun

148
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
thing it allows us to be like mr robot

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
for a moment and it's like yes we've

150
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
taken over the world

151
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
but the importance of it is it's

152
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
actually doing it and for me

153
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,080
i learn best by doing i really wish i

154
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
could read a book and be able to take it

155
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
straight like that but for me i need to

156
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
do it i need to break things that's

157
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,639
naturally who i am so that's what we're

158
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
doing with the ctf

159
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
so like i said i know nothing if you

160
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
don't know anything raise your hand come

161
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
and find us we're in if if you're in the

162
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,520
event like you are here

163
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
we're just on the tables to the left

164
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
over there or to the right left right

165
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,520
hard um if you're virtual online we're

166
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,039
also on a slack channel and we'll show

167
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
you the slide channel in a moment um

168
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
you'll find us and i'll mention that in

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,639
a moment um

170
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,240
but just remember we're here to learn

171
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,680
there are no stupid questions

172
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,400
so yes there isn't any stupid questions

173
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
but there are the one thing that i'll

174
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,639
say is there are stupid assumptions

175
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,720
you are stupid if you assume that i'm

176
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,560
going to remember you asking me what you

177
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,080
think is a stupid question when to me

178
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,919
it's an actual normal question which i'm

179
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,520
asked a lot of the time

180
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
so if you ever feel like this is too

181
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
much me just come to me like honestly i

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
can't remember what my last slide was

183
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
that's how terrible my memory is right

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,960
now

185
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
and what we're looking for is this

186
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,919
feeling of a land party that we've been

187
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
to

188
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
so today

189
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,800
today um

190
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
james and i and a couple of other cpas

191
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,919
we're going to run through last year's

192
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,319
ctf did anyone attend last year's ctf

193
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
online did anyone get some classes

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
lovely to meet you all and there's a

195
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
number of people who haven't so if you

196
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,120
haven't played that we're going to play

197
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
through one of the scenarios in a moment

198
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,759
but

199
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,039
what we're going to do is that today

200
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,160
we're going to help we're going to do

201
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
some like training we're going to show

202
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,639
you how we're going to attack these

203
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,000
things and see how we can do these

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
things

205
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
so that leads us on to tomorrow

206
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
so tomorrow you're going to try harder

207
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,639
now if it's the first time you've heard

208
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,160
try harder

209
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,479
don't be i'm not being rude it's just

210
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,400
saying like this is us it's like if you

211
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,479
go to the gym if you're taking all that

212
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,680
effort to go to the gym and then you

213
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,599
just do like a little sesh

214
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,360
that's not going to give you any

215
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
gains i you can see i don't really go to

216
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,039
the gym that much

217
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,800
the thing here is is that we're in this

218
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,479
area where it's like we're going to try

219
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
to enable we're trying to help you get

220
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
to that next level that's what we're

221
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
trying to do here and so tomorrow we're

222
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,599
not going to give any hints or tips

223
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,280
we're gonna have ctfd running which

224
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,800
means that when you find a flag you can

225
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
submit it and what do flags make

226
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
thank you prizes thank you to the only

227
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,479
person from the uk um

228
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,759
and so with that we'll have a

229
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,759
leaderboard and then again that's just

230
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,960
for us to have some fun tomorrow

231
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
now we're basing this um our whole

232
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,919
system is based on this simulator please

233
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
feel free to take a photo come and ask

234
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
us we can point you towards this repo

235
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,000
we've had it for a while now and in all

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
honesty as with

237
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,120
many open source projects it needs a bit

238
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
more love at times and there's lots of

239
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
you here if you enjoy what you're going

240
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
to be doing today this is what you can

241
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,319
take home to run this yourself this is

242
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
how you can run it and pay for your own

243
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,120
cloud bills

244
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
um

245
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,520
and

246
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
but what we're doing today is is that

247
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
we've got something else

248
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,240
um

249
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
so we built on top of this

250
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
it's it's scaling it at high numbers

251
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,440
there's something there's some other

252
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
technology that we're here to talk about

253
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
that does something similar um we've so

254
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,639
we've we've created this little secret

255
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
sauce that allows us to spin up i'm

256
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
hoping we're around like 60 70 clusters

257
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,039
now james but i can see his head's deep

258
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,840
in a laptop so there's a thumbs up so

259
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,720
for us

260
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,240
we've never been in this position before

261
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,520
so taskmaster um again for one person

262
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
from the uk um if you've seen the tv

263
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
show taskmaster that's where this idea

264
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,559
came from

265
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,000
during covid

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
we created an identity because who

267
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,159
doesn't make their own identity and

268
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
market um

269
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
and so the taskmaster is there to

270
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,279
support you so if you want to access a

271
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,680
cluster if you dm the taskmaster the

272
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,160
taskmaster will send you a cluster

273
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,880
now this is at risk risk of uh ddosing

274
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
ourselves right now so if all of you ask

275
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
for a cluster

276
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
uh it's not going to be too much fun and

277
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
james's thumb up we'll go to a thumb

278
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,680
down quite quickly so please be patient

279
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,839
with us we're trying our best um but we

280
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,360
will get you clusters if you really want

281
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,000
to play about we've got we'll we'll get

282
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
you sorted

283
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,920
um oh yeah and we use this really secure

284
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
form of

285
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
and we'll do this in a demo now the way

286
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,160
that we provide your credentials to this

287
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,320
cluster we do this the most secure way

288
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
that we know how and it's by providing

289
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,519
ssh credentials over slack i don't know

290
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,959
if anyone's done that in this room but

291
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,040
that's how we're going to do it today

292
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,160
and tomorrow

293
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,640
thank you

294
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
right so it's time for a demo

295
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,279
my timing is all out of sync so let's

296
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
see how far we can go

297
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
um at this point i am now going to just

298
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,839
share my screen

299
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,560
okay that same demo great stuff

300
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,920
right i'm gonna try and refresh this so

301
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
my internet connection has been a bit

302
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
temperamental ah there we go

303
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,519
cool i've gone to the cncf flag um

304
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,959
hopefully some of you can see that

305
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
towards the back

306
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
um

307
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
i walked into this room and i realized i

308
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
didn't clear my history of what we

309
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,279
previously talked about on the cmcf

310
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,600
which was mainly panic um so i've just

311
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
covered it up there so if you go to the

312
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
end of the cloud native slack channel

313
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
you can find it everywhere on the

314
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
interwebs um you'll find the task master

315
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,079
ctf task master from control plane

316
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
all we need to do is and hopefully the

317
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
taskmaster james is on the other side so

318
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,680
i'm going to say

319
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,959
hey taskmaster

320
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,399
aka james

321
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,959
may i please

322
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,079
have a cluster okay

323
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,839
um

324
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,360
so

325
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
it's not like we're all just waiting for

326
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
this one person in the room just to say

327
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
thank you james um

328
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
so

329
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,959
all right i'm going to download this

330
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,680
because i'm going to trust this and

331
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
congratulations

332
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,279
come on we're using conference wi-fi

333
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,800
that deserves a club we've just we've

334
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
done something

335
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
thank you

336
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
so oh actually at the back this might be

337
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,760
a bit small for you hopefully you can

338
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,480
see

339
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
so i've got my in case of emergency and

340
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,839
slack didn't work just then i've now got

341
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,519
my credentials here

342
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
oh i got a tar bundle so i'm going to

343
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,399
run tar xf

344
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
cube zoom now if i do an ls that gives

345
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,720
me the files that i need to ssh on again

346
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
if this is all like brand new to you if

347
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
you don't know what ssh means honestly i

348
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
don't i don't care that you don't know i

349
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
will more than happily help you get over

350
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,959
this part so come find me we can chat

351
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,440
so now that i have my credentials i'm

352
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
just going to share all of my history

353
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
apparently

354
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
and find this command to ssh

355
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,360
onto um on to bastion

356
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
so i just need to accept that so yes i'm

357
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
going to trust i'm on stage why wouldn't

358
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
i

359
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,439
come on conference wi-fi yes

360
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
so does anyone remember the first

361
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,880
scenario from last year

362
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
please be quiet then

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
so

364
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
i will read this out for a moment we are

365
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,760
a defensively minded organization

366
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
we followed our containery best

367
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
practices but we've got a problem it's

368
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
hard to see where it's coming from we've

369
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
discarded our build layers in a

370
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
multi-stage build scanned for known cves

371
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,720
and we're confident the container file

372
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
systems are correct but somehow our arch

373
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,079
nemesis for dreaded

374
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
the dreaded pirate captain hashtag has

375
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,519
broken out onto the host inconceivable a

376
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
calamity and if anyone can say that word

377
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,279
i will get you a drink

378
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
follow the captain and prove out his

379
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
attack path to find the flag you will

380
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,639
start in the hash

381
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,120
jack pod in a phase one blue team name

382
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,040
space

383
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,959
okay so there's a lot of information

384
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,480
there um

385
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
again if any of you um have dealt with

386
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,360
control plane you'll probably know that

387
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
we use lots of words at times

388
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
now it gave us some clues that's what

389
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,279
we're looking for now has anyone read

390
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,600
the book hacking kubernetes

391
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,839
yeah cool um thank you thank you thank

392
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,480
you

393
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
if you haven't read the book

394
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
it's available in places i don't know

395
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,680
it'll probably be on our booth come find

396
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
us and then you um

397
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
yes you can find it there but hashtag is

398
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
our arch nemesis in the book as well we

399
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
created a com we created a mock company

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
for us to basis on and so this is where

401
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,480
jedi jack made his debut last year at

402
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
cubecon eu

403
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
so i've done an ls just to see what i've

404
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,040
got here and so it just looks like

405
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
i'm inside a pod

406
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
um the reason i think i'm on a part is

407
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,440
is because in the top left here i can

408
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,800
see that i'm on hashtag hyphen 5d4

409
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
iphone 4 d5 so that to me suggests i'm

410
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
within a pod that's managed by it could

411
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
be a deployment in this instance

412
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,279
um anyone want to shout out any things i

413
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,040
could do if you've already done this one

414
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,480
don't give the answer straight away this

415
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,560
is

416
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,519
it's pa is pair hacking

417
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,720
all right i'll take lead okay cool so i

418
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
might just want to have a look around so

419
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,320
i could check the environment variables

420
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
i can see that we're on a kebab nice

421
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,320
classic incidentally this is running on

422
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
a real cluster this isn't any other

423
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,959
magic this isn't us trying to just like

424
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,399
put this

425
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,920
facade words in front of you this is an

426
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
actual cluster running on one of the

427
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,279
cloud providers and then you've got full

428
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,279
access to these uh

429
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,040
these nodes instantly the vms are your

430
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
own when we spin up these

431
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,560
so the environment variables yeah

432
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,320
doesn't give too much

433
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,440
um

434
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
i could have look at processes

435
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
i could if i could type

436
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
the nerves for nerves

437
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,800
cool um so i can just see that um we're

438
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,360
doing sleep infinity which i plan to do

439
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
by about this time next week

440
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,519
so

441
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,399
um

442
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
how am i doing on time okay let's i

443
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,519
think i might finish a little bit early

444
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,160
but then we can all get refreshments

445
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,079
so the one useful thing here would

446
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,519
probably be to see what we have mounted

447
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,920
in so we can see we've got a service

448
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,079
account available there that might be of

449
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,839
interest in other scenarios if you want

450
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,160
to play about today then i'll look there

451
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,399
but the one here that i'm really of

452
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,880
interest is mount

453
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,279
so if i run mount um i start to see that

454
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,040
there are some things mounted in here

455
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,399
that are of interest to me

456
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,399
the one that i have of interest is dev

457
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,839
xvd a1 so that in stanley can start to

458
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,519
identify where i might be running this

459
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,279
vm

460
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
but it also gives me a point of attack

461
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,160
and remember when you are doing this ctf

462
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
if you want to just check again just

463
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,560
disconnect reconnect

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,680
see this message

465
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,040
if i've lost my connection now after

466
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,639
doing that i'm

467
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
i'm going to be fuming um and we can

468
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,639
read this again so the point what we're

469
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
trying to find here is is we're trying

470
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,399
to find out what hashtag did to persist

471
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,839
uh connect

472
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,199
to prove out the attack path that

473
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,880
hashtag took and then we're going to

474
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,240
look for some persistence as to what

475
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,639
they did next

476
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,240
so we looked at mount and then we found

477
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
that we had xvda1

478
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
now again just to say um because if

479
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
you're like new to linux if if like this

480
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,600
is your first cubron if again please

481
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,920
come find us i i remember mine fondly

482
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
and i was intimidated but

483
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,920
it's all about dropping ladders so i'm

484
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,120
more than happy to help you up to this

485
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,440
point um within the linux file system

486
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
when we mount something we're mounting

487
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,399
data onto it so the wavelength i like to

488
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,160
think of it is just like a usb stick if

489
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,399
you're running windows or mac os you

490
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,839
just connect that memory stick in and

491
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,199
then it's in your file system you can

492
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,360
access it on linux we need to use mount

493
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,079
it's a little bit different

494
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,920
that's

495
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,600
so what i can do is actually let me just

496
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,959
prepare this a little bit better so if

497
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,839
we check on this mount

498
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,120
we can see that there's nothing in there

499
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
at the moment

500
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
but now if we mount

501
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,559
dev um xvd a1

502
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,799
into mount

503
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
and then we'll just replay that command

504
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
that we had a moment ago

505
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,959
and now we've mounted this uh

506
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,240
this disk

507
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,400
on into our container

508
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
um

509
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
and now we can see it within there so

510
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,359
hopefully that

511
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,559
brings it very if you're brand new to

512
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,679
this

513
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,280
but this is interesting this looks like

514
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,600
a file system that is similar to our

515
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
container but there's a little bit more

516
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
in there

517
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
and so this is probably the attack path

518
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
that hashtag took to persist a

519
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,440
connection

520
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
um

521
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,919
so let's just change to mount because

522
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,480
that usually confuses me at this point

523
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
so now we're mounted into another file

524
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,520
system

525
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
so how might an attacker persist a

526
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,080
connection

527
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
i realize i'm a little bit quick on my

528
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
timing so that's why i'm holding for

529
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,520
effect

530
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,760
so what they might have done is is ssh

531
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,120
so i'm going to assume that this is a

532
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,640
virtual machine and there's other things

533
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
i could do to start identifying a

534
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
virtual machine if you want to do those

535
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
things again give give us a shout we'll

536
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
give you scenarios you can play about

537
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,039
this yourself and find other flags

538
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,400
but i'm just going straight for kill

539
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
here so i'm going to just check what the

540
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
root user has but i'm not going to find

541
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,240
it with just ls so if i check root

542
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
so i can see that we got an ssh

543
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
directory there

544
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
so let's move into root

545
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,080
and go to ssh

546
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
and stanley um if it starts with a dart

547
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
then it's just a hidden directory or

548
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,760
hidden file so now if we have a look

549
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,200
here we can see our authorized keys

550
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
and so if i cut out our authorized keys

551
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
we can see all the keys that we can use

552
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,720
to access this then at the bottom

553
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
we can see just here let's bring up a

554
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,840
little bit

555
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,160
uh pi radical note itself don't misplace

556
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,360
this flag your cc hashtag ps and then

557
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,000
here's our flag

558
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
so this is our introduction yesterday

559
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
and i'll explain a bit what's happened

560
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
here now in a moment but what you do

561
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,280
tomorrow is when you find a flag like

562
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
this you'd go to ctfd which we'll give

563
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,440
you a link to you submit this flag and

564
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,799
then you get points

565
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,240
this is the whole purpose of a capture

566
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,000
flag now we've shown you this attack

567
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,360
path we've shown you what's happened

568
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,120
here but we haven't really described

569
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
what it was does anyone know what

570
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
happened there why we were able to

571
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,000
access that now if you did it last year

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,200
you're more than welcome to shout out

573
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,799
definitely silence

574
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,520
so that was a privileged container and

575
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,640
so

576
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,160
and does anyone know privileged

577
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
containers in here or are we all

578
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
absolutely dead okay we got a couple

579
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,919
okay sweet so a privileged container why

580
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,760
might you use the privileged container

581
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,080
so containers we use it to isolate our

582
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
workloads

583
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,760
um and in isolation using linux

584
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,559
namespaces and c groups um

585
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,320
that isolation means that we're not

586
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
really like we don't have access outside

587
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
of that because that's what we want we

588
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
want this boundary

589
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
now if you're running a workload that's

590
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,039
dependent on something on the machine

591
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,799
then you need to look at the

592
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,240
capabilities that are available within

593
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
that container now if you go into one of

594
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,919
those favorite websites i can take you

595
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,440
from your favorite search engine to say

596
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
that this bug is happening someone might

597
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,480
suggest you to run a privileged

598
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
container the only problem is is a

599
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,000
running privileged container essentially

600
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
means that you're running as root on

601
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
that virtual machine and so that's what

602
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
happened for us this container within

603
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,760
this part was being run as a privilege

604
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,559
and

605
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,159
running as privileged which meant that

606
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,559
we had access to the xvd a1 which was

607
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,640
the file system on the virtual machine

608
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720
and then when we migrated when we moved

609
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,120
across into that we are able to act as

610
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
root on that machine

611
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,039
cool um

612
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,520
and so then um we had to look and then

613
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,200
the hashtag in this instance instead of

614
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,720
having to do this attack path to get

615
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,799
into this container to then break out of

616
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,440
it

617
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
by adding the public key into the

618
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,400
authorized keys then they were able to

619
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,960
ssh onto the node at this moment in time

620
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
it's pretty much game over for this node

621
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,360
this isn't ideal whatsoever

622
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
so

623
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
that's what it's taught us um points to

624
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
mention there's a number of us from

625
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
control plane who are given talks over

626
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,039
this week um everything from

627
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,200
operators to fret modeling to anything

628
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
else so please come find us you'll find

629
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,120
we got like these t-shirts with control

630
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
plane written on them

631
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,000
um

632
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,520
how would you mitigate against this kind

633
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,799
of attack incidentally well you wouldn't

634
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,159
run a privileged container you shouldn't

635
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
be running a privileged container if you

636
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,080
are don't worry if you are incidentally

637
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,600
we run this quite often with our

638
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
training

639
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,559
um and i've been in training before

640
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,480
where someone's had to run quite quickly

641
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,640
because it was in production

642
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,840
so

643
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
don't worry but look at the capabilities

644
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,600
instead of giving focus on least

645
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
privilege and you want to not give like

646
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
everything with a privileged flag just

647
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
look at what it needs to enable equally

648
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
defense in depth i'm probably talking

649
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,480
well sorry defense in depth yes so if we

650
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,080
fret model of this and then we don't

651
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,440
want to run a privileged container for

652
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
our web public for intents we don't want

653
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,280
to run a privileged container anyway we

654
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
can have defense in depth

655
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,240
okay um it's at 20 past i'm i'm pretty

656
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,960
much sure i am done on everything else

657
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,760
um

658
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
thank you for your time if you do have

659
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,039
any questions then i'm more than happy

660
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
to take them now

661
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
