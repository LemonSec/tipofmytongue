1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,879
so next we have security champions if

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,960
you haven't heard of it um you will soon

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,319
anne marie fred's going to be talking

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,400
about that so you'll get to see why it's

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,679
important

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,120
all right thank you

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,719
is my mic on yeah there we go

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
all right thanks everybody for coming to

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,119
this talk today

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,760
uh my name is anne-marie fred i'm a

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
senior principal software engineer at

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,039
red hat

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,760
and the talk is about security champions

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,160
what they are why you need them and how

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
to get a program started

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,320
a little bit about myself first so

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,399
i was a full-time software developer for

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,640
more than 20 years

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,879
of which the last 10 years or so was in

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,120
a devops environment

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,440
i was a devops days conference

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,920
co-organizer in raleigh north carolina

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,280
for three years

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,120
i'm currently also active in the linux

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,280
foundation and cd foundation and a

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,760
couple of their open source projects

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,320
i was an hr manager for three years and

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
then went back to being an individual

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
contributor

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,600
for the last four years i've been acting

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,640
as a security focal for my organizations

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
most of my career was at ibm and then

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
last year i moved to red hat

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,720
quick disclaimer my experience is not

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,240
the official position of either those

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,640
companies

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
so according to former fbi director

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,759
robert mueller there's only two types of

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,920
companies those that have been hacked

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,680
and those that will be

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,400
which one are you

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,360
in fact in 2020 sonatype did this

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
devsecops community survey and they

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,280
found that in just the previous 12

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,240
months 24 percent of the respondents

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
said that their company either had been

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
hacked or they suspected that they had

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,759
been

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,200
successfully breached in fact

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,240
most of those breaches target the data

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,960
that your company has and data breaches

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
can be amazingly expensive

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
gdpr and other privacy regula

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
regulations hold companies liable for

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,199
those breaches and it's not just the

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,038
fines that you get from the regulators

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,120
that are expensive but also the cost of

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
repairing the damage that was done

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,920
and ignorance of a vulnerability or of a

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
breach in progress is not a defense from

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
your liability

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
this can cause major damage to a

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
company's reputation if you think about

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
high profile file breaches at places

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
like facebook equifax linkedin anthem

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
how many of you were affected by at

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,840
least one of those

68
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,720
breaches yeah

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,800
how many were affected by

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
most of them

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
so

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,400
according to ibm's 2021 cost of a data

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
breach report

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
the average cost of repairing one of

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
these is 4.24 million dollars

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,640
in 2021 there were over 18 000 cve

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,120
disclosures how many is that per day i

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
don't know somebody do the math

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
and also last year there were at least

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,640
66 zero day vulnerabilities reported so

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
a couple times per week we're having to

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,119
deal with this now

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,599
so what does this all mean if you're

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,519
using open source software well of

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
course open source accelerates your

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,080
development and most people are using it

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,239
but it does bring with it a host of

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,560
publicly disclosed known vulnerabilities

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
the good news is that security

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,159
researchers are out there using

91
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,080
automated scanning and detection tools

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,239
to scan open source projects and find

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,599
vulnerabilities

94
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
and then report them to the owners so

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
it's happening faster and in a greater

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
volume than ever before

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
the bad news is that bad actors have

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
access to the exact same tools and they

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,159
may not tell you about the

100
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,840
vulnerabilities that they find

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,920
in fact in the white source state of

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
open source vulnerabilities report from

103
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
last year there were 50 percent more

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,200
vulnerabilities in 2020 versus 2019 and

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
we see this trend continuing

106
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,600
here's some more bad news

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
according to derek weeks the time

108
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,479
between a vulnerability being announced

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
and the exploits appearing in the wild

110
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
used to be 45 days

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
that is compressed by 93 percent over

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,880
the last decade to three days

113
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
there's just no time

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
and what if you're cloud native what

115
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,639
does that mean so usually as a cloud

116
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
native organization that means that

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
you're going to very quickly get your

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
new apis websites whatever out onto the

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
internet and accessible

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
that means you need to secure it from

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
day one so you know when i was looking

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
at our laugh traffic last year on ibm's

123
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,759
website

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
we would see people running

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,600
scanning tools like security testing

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
tools like burp suite against our

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
website people who are not us every

128
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,160
single week

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,000
and a big part of knowing how to secure

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
your apis in your websites is

131
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
understanding how to scan your software

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,199
using static testing dynamic testing and

133
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,039
then how to interpret the results and

134
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,600
actually fix the problems for example

135
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are

136
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,120
very easy to detect anybody can scan

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
your site or your apis and see them

138
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
they're also very easy to fix but only

139
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,680
if you know what to do about it

140
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
and ci cd is another aspect of cloud

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
native of course

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
now the good news is that we don't have

143
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,560
so much of a bottleneck at the release

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
process like it's quite possible for us

145
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,039
to fix software and deploy the fix

146
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,600
within a day or a couple hours even but

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,199
now we've just moved the bottleneck to

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,160
the development team

149
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
so it's a race and the only way to beat

150
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
the uh you know the bad actors here is

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
that we need continuous security

152
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,800
here's more bad news though so according

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,199
to toby irvine's research and my own

154
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,199
personal experience and talking around

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,120
this also holds

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
for every 100 developers there's only

157
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,360
one professional cyber security

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
person here

159
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
like somebody working in it full time

160
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,600
that means that cyber security

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
professionals are a scarce resource and

162
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,000
that means that security often gets

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
neglected in our transformations

164
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
security is still very often treated as

165
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,919
a last minute gate so a month or two

166
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,600
before people try to release new

167
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
software into production

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
they'll do a quick threat modeling

169
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
exercise they'll run some manual

170
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
penetration testing

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,599
they'll fix vulnerabilities for a couple

172
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,360
of weeks but maybe they won't have time

173
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
to fix all of them and then since

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
there's already you know a committed

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
date to ship it they ship it right

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,039
the fact of the matter is a tiny cyber

177
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,039
security team just can't find and fix

178
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,560
vulnerabilities within three days

179
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,520
without a lot of help

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,319
so if we want to move faster while being

181
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,400
more secure we have to up our game

182
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
and how do we do that we have to make

183
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
our technical teams more self-sufficient

184
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,319
with respect to their own cyber security

185
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,199
we need many more application security

186
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,199
subject matter experts we need to scale

187
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
up from about one percent to about 10

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,919
percent of our technical population

189
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,680
and we need more people who are

190
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
qualified to dig into the details of

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,919
security reports and security tool

192
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,400
findings

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
now it's always hard to have any sort of

194
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
change so i'm going to talk about some

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
things that motivated my teams recently

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
at ibm digital in 2019 we did internal

197
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,000
dev ops surveys across our teams

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
and we identified security work as one

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,639
of the top three pain points for our

200
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
developers in an area where they were

201
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
asking for help

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
at red hat we just went through

203
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
restructuring our product security

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
programs in response to the may 2021

205
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
executive order on improving the

206
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
nation's cyber security

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
red hat's an important part of the

208
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
supply chain for a lot of companies so

209
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
we need to make sure that our security

210
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
practices are really like industry

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
leading in state of the art

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
and for a lot of companies a big

213
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,960
motivator was the log for j log for

214
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,080
shell vulnerability at the end of 2021

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
and the pain of dealing with that

216
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,159
now

217
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,799
log4j is a typical example of a software

218
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
package in open source it's very common

219
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,399
it's used in most java code

220
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,560
and it's a widely trusted software

221
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
library people had no reason to believe

222
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,080
it would be a problem

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
it's used by hundreds of millions of

224
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,360
devices

225
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
in 60

226
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
of the java projects it's used

227
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,880
indirectly so if you look at the

228
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
dependencies of your own software you

229
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,200
won't see log4j listed but if you look

230
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
at the dependencies of your dependencies

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,120
that's where you find it

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
it makes it a little bit harder to find

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
you need tools or software analysis to

234
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
help you find it

235
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,040
and this vulnerability allows arbitrary

236
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
code execution which is the holy grail

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
of exploits and it can be exploited over

238
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
the internet without authentication

239
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
in fact within days of this

240
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
vulnerability being published thousands

241
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
of companies had been attacked within a

242
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,640
week it was tens of thousands

243
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,480
so with all this why do we need security

244
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
champions in particular

245
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
like i said before only one cyber

246
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
security professional to every 100

247
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,800
developers is not enough they're spread

248
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
too thin

249
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
and furthermore developers the people

250
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
closest to the code are the ones who are

251
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
best equipped to keep their own quotes

252
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
secure but they need some basic

253
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
application security training to do that

254
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
security champions is also an excellent

255
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
way to promote a devsecops culture where

256
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
developers have control and

257
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,959
responsibility for their own application

258
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,518
security

259
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,640
so what do i mean when i say security

260
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,480
champions well

261
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
to me it's when you have one management

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
designated person per small team or

263
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,720
squad

264
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
and this should be at least one tenth of

265
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
your development population and in that

266
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
including developers architects testers

267
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
sres etc

268
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
and they should have about 10 or 15

269
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
hours of application security training

270
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
which is enough to be a local subject

271
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,519
matter expert for their own

272
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,120
a team of terms i use and i know

273
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
everybody uses different terms this is

274
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
how i define them

275
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,880
security focal somebody more like myself

276
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,120
so it's maybe a 50 up to 100 percent

277
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
time commitment

278
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
um advising across five to 15 you know

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
maybe a couple dozen teams or squads

280
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
and security focals are going to work

281
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
closely with the other security focals

282
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
as well

283
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
as the cyber security organization for

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
your company and they're working across

285
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
a division or business unit and they're

286
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
the primary point of contact with

287
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
corporate cyber security experts and

288
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
they're responsible to ensure that the

289
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,640
security champions are reacting quickly

290
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,519
and reporting back status on urgent and

291
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,600
important security work

292
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,120
security champions on the other hand is

293
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,839
more like a 25 time commitment

294
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,920
so in some weeks like when threat

295
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,600
modeling is happening or doing

296
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
penetration testing or maybe audits it

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,320
can be a full-time job but in other

298
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
weeks it might only be an hour or two

299
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
and they only need to advise their own

300
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
small team or squad

301
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,760
they're going to work closely with the

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
other cyber the other security champions

303
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
in their own organization and with their

304
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,920
own security focal

305
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,760
and they're responsible for monitoring

306
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,839
communications from their security focal

307
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,600
getting the work done within their own

308
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
team and then reporting back

309
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
so there's a playbook for how you can

310
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,000
get this set up we've done it at a few

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,279
companies now

312
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
if you want to start your own security

313
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,720
champions program

314
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
first you're going to need a small

315
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
working group just a few people's enough

316
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,399
three five people

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,680
you usually just go out and ask for

318
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,200
volunteers who wants to help us start

319
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
this up you need to create and publish a

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
program description explaining what

321
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,160
you're doing and why and you know what

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
the expectations are

323
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,200
and then you're going to take that

324
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,040
program description and shop it around

325
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,639
to your management team an executive

326
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
team to get their buy-in because you're

327
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
asking them to commu commit resources

328
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
in terms of time and money

329
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,839
then you're going to choose a training

330
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,839
program which depending on what you have

331
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,279
available

332
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,600
might require some time to you know go

333
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
actually watch some trading modules and

334
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
see what you like you're going to choose

335
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,240
a training program you're going to pay

336
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
for it and set a due date for when you

337
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,279
want your champions to have that done

338
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,959
then you're also going to ask your

339
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,440
managers to appoint the designated

340
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,200
security champion from each of the small

341
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
teams or squads and you want to keep a

342
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,639
list of that

343
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,839
your working group will set up the

344
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,680
communications channels that you need

345
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,399
and then kick it off

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
so i mentioned that you need a program

347
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,200
description

348
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,800
actually in the backup slides i have

349
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
more details about what i put in it but

350
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,399
some highlights that i wanted to call

351
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,760
out of course you're going to want to

352
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,600
have introductory information what

353
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
you're doing and why

354
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
it's important to lay out the

355
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,040
expectations for the security champions

356
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,720
and their teams in terms of time

357
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
commitment the training that you're

358
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
expecting them to complete the

359
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,320
communications that you want to have in

360
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,279
place and everybody's responsibilities

361
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,880
and do this in advance so the managers

362
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
know what they're signing people up for

363
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,199
i like to call out that these are highly

364
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,680
valued subject matter experts this is

365
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
really good on a resume

366
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
so go ahead and you know call that out

367
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
and it's also not necessarily the

368
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
technical lead or the most senior person

369
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,279
on the team honestly technical leads get

370
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,959
stuck in a lot of meetings they might

371
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,560
not want this role

372
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
but if you can find somebody else like a

373
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
more junior developer who's really

374
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
excited to learn more about security

375
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,360
that can be a great person as well

376
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,320
and

377
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,760
you have to call it these are not the

378
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,680
only team members who are going to be

379
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
responsible for security work a lot of

380
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
the work of security can be tedious and

381
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,079
time consuming and you need to make sure

382
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,360
that that's going to be shared across

383
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,320
the entire team

384
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,040
here are some things to think about when

385
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
choosing your training plan so like i

386
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
said before we're going for maybe 10 or

387
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,680
15 hours and i like to give people like

388
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
if i'm if i'm doing a 10 hour training

389
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,880
program i'll give them 10 weeks to

390
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,639
complete it right so if they want to do

391
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,240
an hour a week that's fine or if they

392
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
want to cram it all into a couple

393
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,720
fridays also fine

394
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
cyber security basics is something that

395
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,920
hopefully everybody in the company is

396
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
getting and that's an hour or two on

397
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,279
things like how to recognize phishing

398
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,839
attempts how to secure your passwords

399
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
how and when to report a security

400
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
incident right

401
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
then security and privacy for developers

402
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,079
is going to be three or four hours that

403
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,760
hopefully all technical people in the

404
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,240
company are taking this is things like

405
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,959
how to validate your input and why how

406
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
to escape your output correctly

407
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,199
how to handle personal and private and

408
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,959
confidential data

409
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,120
your companies own cyber security

410
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,600
standards and processes and people and

411
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
who to reach out to with questions

412
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,240
and how they should report a software

413
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
risk or vulnerability if they find one

414
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,279
then what we're adding on top of that is

415
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,680
maybe three to five hours about security

416
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,079
and privacy by design practices things

417
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:46,959
like

418
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,120
applications that are secure by default

419
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,639
and how to properly configure

420
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
applications

421
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
security in your ci cd pipelines

422
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,759
and how to run code reviews with a

423
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,880
security mindset

424
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,639
importantly we also want to make sure

425
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,120
that we're covering the owasp top 10 or

426
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
sans top 25 the most common

427
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,120
vulnerabilities in software

428
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,920
and

429
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,079
yeah four to five hours this is probably

430
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,959
good this is teaching the developers how

431
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,839
to recognize and find and fix those

432
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,040
vulnerabilities i also like to include

433
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,199
an hour or two of the basics of threat

434
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,320
modeling

435
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
like why it's done what you're hoping to

436
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
do how you should prepare for it you

437
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,320
know what kind of architecture diagrams

438
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,839
you need in advance

439
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,120
what kind of documents you're going to

440
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
produce this is

441
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
not enough for them to be like great

442
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
leaders of threat modeling exercises but

443
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,839
it's enough for them to be a lot of help

444
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,240
to a security architect who comes in and

445
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
runs those threat modeling

446
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,880
exercises with them and it should be

447
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
enough actually for them to keep the

448
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
threat models up to date over time as

449
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
the application changes

450
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,680
and i have some examples of training

451
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,839
plans that i like in the backup slide so

452
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,839
i'll put them up at the end of the talk

453
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,599
as a nice side effect according to

454
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,880
sonotype on the in their 2020 devsecops

455
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,280
community survey developers who receive

456
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
training on how to code securely are

457
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,160
five times more likely to enjoy their

458
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,439
work

459
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,839
awesome

460
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,039
it's also important to have an interlock

461
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,679
meeting and we do this in the context of

462
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,640
a secure engineering guild

463
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
so

464
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
i say you know the attendance is

465
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
expected for the security focals and

466
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
security champions if they can't make it

467
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
live then i want them to watch the

468
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
recording

469
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
and we we do want to make sure that we

470
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
have a recording or at least a really

471
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,840
good agenda with detailed minutes and

472
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,520
notes

473
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
some topics that we've covered in the

474
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,760
recent past are things like checking on

475
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,720
status of time sensitive work any new

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,280
corporate initiatives or security alerts

477
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,880
that we want people to be aware of that

478
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
week

479
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,760
security tools and tool adoption details

480
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
so a lot of these security tools that

481
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,600
you get integrated into your pipelines

482
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
you may find that there's tips and

483
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,960
tricks that only apply to your own

484
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,400
organization right like where do i get

485
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
the value for this variable or how do i

486
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,799
sign up for this software in my org so

487
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,320
we're sharing that information with each

488
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
other

489
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,160
we also do pair programming just you

490
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
know somebody who's figured it out we'll

491
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,280
sit with somebody else who is trying to

492
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,520
do it at the time

493
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,080
we talk about penetration testing and

494
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
remediation when that's going on

495
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
it's also fun to include security in the

496
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,640
news a couple of recent articles

497
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
and as time permits five or ten minutes

498
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,039
of education on a topic that's relevant

499
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,000
that week so for example at red hat a

500
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
lot of people are going through security

501
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
assessments right now so one of our

502
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,120
upcoming topics is just going to be a

503
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,880
walkthrough of an assessment where

504
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,559
people can ask their own questions about

505
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,720
it

506
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,160
a little more about other communications

507
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
channels that are helpful my favorite is

508
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
actually instant messaging like slack

509
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,360
it's great for real-time conversations

510
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
and if i have a private channel with

511
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,720
just the security champions in it i

512
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
don't have to worry about doing the at

513
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
channel

514
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
if i need to just ping everybody really

515
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,440
quickly

516
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,520
we also have like email lists for

517
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,840
security champions and focals and their

518
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,720
managers and so on

519
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,520
for bug tracking you need a system set

520
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,400
up to handle security bugs

521
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,880
they might require embargoes and they

522
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,600
definitely require auditability

523
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
and then just your normal work tracking

524
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,919
system for your squads just to make sure

525
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,000
that the time sensitive work gets done

526
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
like okay let's make sure we all get our

527
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,360
security assessments done on time

528
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,840
not without challenges

529
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,799
um one that i've run into a lot is

530
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,039
dealing with global teams

531
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
so how many people in here have globally

532
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,760
distributed development teams across

533
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
multiple time zones yeah like

534
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,039
more than half

535
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
as you know finding a time for any kind

536
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,320
of group meeting is difficult and

537
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,679
everyone tries to schedule their

538
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
recurring meetings during the exact same

539
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
time slot it's like

540
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,000
four to five europe time first thing in

541
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,840
the morning in north america right

542
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
so my recommendation is to either choose

543
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
a meeting time that works for your most

544
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
engaged people who are actually showing

545
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,120
up

546
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,679
or have two meeting times about 12 hours

547
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,240
apart either one can work

548
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,320
i also recommend encouraging and

549
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
supporting asynchronous communication so

550
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,559
you've got instant messaging you've got

551
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960
your shared documents meeting recordings

552
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,080
email etc

553
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
another one that i ran into

554
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,440
at red hat recently was the training

555
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,000
program funding so we chose one that

556
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
cost about 250 dollars per user which is

557
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,480
pretty good and by the time we got the

558
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
budget approval we only had three months

559
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,360
left on the contract before it ran out

560
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
so they weren't taking new users and we

561
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
had to wait for the security team to

562
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
negotiate a contract for the next year

563
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
so my recommendation is to go ahead and

564
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,559
choose the online training program and

565
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,559
request the funding early because that

566
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,880
could become like the long poll

567
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
it could take a while

568
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
also if you already have a good training

569
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,559
program available to you just start with

570
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,039
that so at ibm i was lucky we had a

571
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,280
really good internal learning system and

572
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
all we had to do was find the security

573
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,919
modules that we liked and and evaluate

574
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,840
them you know we shared each person

575
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,240
watched a couple of hours and

576
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
strung them together into a trading plan

577
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,199
and we didn't have to pay for anything

578
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,440
another thing i ran into um how many

579
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,000
people here have compliance fatigue

580
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,480
you're like sick of patching things and

581
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,320
filling out forms yeah yeah

582
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,240
our developers at ibm we're already

583
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
spending up to about 25

584
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
of their time on things like data

585
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,080
subject requests

586
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
privacy and security reviews

587
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
internal audits patching software every

588
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,679
week

589
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,679
and to them this felt like just more

590
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,720
compliance work piling on top right and

591
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
too much tedious work like this leads to

592
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,559
a type of burnout people really get sick

593
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,799
of it

594
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,679
frankly it's not actually more work

595
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,840
overall but it is kind of concentrating

596
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,360
more of it and one person in the team

597
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
and one of the goals we chose to address

598
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
this for the secure engineering guild

599
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
was to automate as much of the toil as

600
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,760
possible so

601
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
we had people doing little side projects

602
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,520
to help get things automated and they

603
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,679
would share that back to our team and

604
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,120
again pair program

605
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
programming with each other to put these

606
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,880
things into practice

607
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
and we also partnered with our cso

608
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,799
organization to pilot new tools that

609
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
they were considering buying that way we

610
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,400
made sure that the tools that were

611
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,080
available to us were the ones that were

612
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,120
going to work well for us

613
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,280
so what do we get for all this work

614
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
so 12 months after starting the program

615
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,840
at ibm digital we did in fact have 10

616
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,360
percent of our developers who were

617
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
subject matter experts so they completed

618
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
their training programs and they stuck

619
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,080
with it as security champions

620
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
we were able to handle critical alerts

621
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,400
which we called cso overrides often

622
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,880
within one to three days and by handled

623
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
i mean that's from the time that the

624
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,559
vulnerability was reported

625
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
the cyber security org fanned it out to

626
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
the focals the vocals fanned it out to

627
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,799
the champions the champions evaluated

628
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,520
their software they saw they had the

629
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,679
vulnerability they reported back to

630
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,240
cyber security if needed they fixed the

631
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
problem if there was a patch available

632
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
and they put it in production within one

633
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,840
to three

634
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,919
days importantly to me as a focal i knew

635
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,440
that no teams were falling through the

636
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,919
cracks so we were responsible for about

637
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,320
130 applications in my group

638
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,559
and i knew that by talking to my dozen

639
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,320
or so security champions those were all

640
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,159
going to get covered i just needed to

641
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,760
hear back from those dozen people

642
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,400
we also saw far fewer of our security

643
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
reports whether they were from pen

644
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
testing or

645
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,799
security tools or from hacker one that

646
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,720
were marked as false alert or could not

647
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,400
reproduce

648
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
so false alert or could not reproduce is

649
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,720
often developer code for i don't know

650
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,919
what this is

651
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,320
right and by giving people that extra

652
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,480
education they actually recognize what

653
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,159
the vulnerability is and they have a

654
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,320
path to figure out how to fix it

655
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
in fact about halfway through that year

656
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
our security team said that that was no

657
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
longer a valid answer and you were going

658
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,000
to have to provide some sort of fixer

659
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,720
mitigation for everything

660
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
we also uncovered new vulnerabilities

661
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
so as our developers were doing the

662
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
training they were thinking in the back

663
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,559
of their heads oh

664
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,720
i might want to look in my own software

665
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
for that particular vulnerability and

666
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,679
they would come back to the guild

667
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,679
meetings and tell us hey you know i

668
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,960
found this vulnerability in my software

669
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
maybe you should check in yours as well

670
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,360
and we saw broader adoption of threat

671
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,279
modeling so we were used to also doing

672
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,200
threat models right before pen testing

673
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
or right before shipping a product

674
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,200
and with this program people took their

675
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,240
threat modeling training and they're

676
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,600
like oh this sounds cool and they

677
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
reached out to our security architects

678
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,159
and they asked to do them early

679
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
and most importantly to me we had people

680
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
who are thinking about security every

681
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
week

682
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,679
so a few q takeaways if you're

683
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,840
interested know that a security

684
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,240
champions program is straightforward and

685
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,320
repeatable you can do it

686
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,919
but you're going to need management

687
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,960
support

688
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
you're going to need a few people

689
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
handful one to three months to get the

690
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,919
program started

691
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,080
you'll need that funding for the online

692
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,120
training

693
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
you need to identify one security

694
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,880
champion per team

695
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,159
and you're going to need one or two

696
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,080
secure engineering guild leads per org

697
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,320
and let's work together so i would love

698
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,880
to talk to you one-on-one after this

699
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,799
have you tried something similar what

700
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,640
worked what didn't work what did you

701
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
learn that might help others in the

702
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
future

703
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,200
