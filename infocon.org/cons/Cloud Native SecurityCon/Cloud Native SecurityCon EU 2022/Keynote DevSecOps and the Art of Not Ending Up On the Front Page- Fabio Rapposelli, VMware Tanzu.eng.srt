1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,599
thanks for having me uh my name is fabio

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,439
poselli i'm a senior staff engineer with

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,799
vmware

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,640
and you can find me on twitter uh which

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,759
is probably the only social media i

6
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,880
still use so at fabio rapacelli

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,719
today i want to talk about uh so like

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,200
the worst nightmare uh of all the public

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,440
relations departments out there which is

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,199
your company making you know national

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,840
news because of a security breach

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,519
before we get started though i just want

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,160
to acknowledge something uh like it's

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,840
great to be back in europe it's great to

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
be back in person i'm sure many of you

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,320
can relate with the meme up there on the

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,360
screen

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
and i can't wait to see old friends and

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
making new ones here in valencia this

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
week so

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,879
if you see me around stop me we can chat

22
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,840
it's great see everybody

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,079
back let's get down to business now um

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,360
so

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
do you remember uh this headline from a

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
couple of years back

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
if you don't remember this one

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
you might remember this one

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,239
or maybe this one or maybe this one

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,239
so the thorough wins hack uh pretty much

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,559
sparked so like this intense debate on

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
and exposed the importance of the

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
software supply chain

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,479
in a way that i've rarely seen in my

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,720
life honestly and you know i've been in

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,560
this industry for like 20 plus years and

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
it's the first time i see such an uproar

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,320
in terms of like you know legislation

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
and so like discourse around this

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,920
specific problem it was not the first

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,759
time that there was a you know something

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,520
similar to that happen actually but the

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,920
target the scale and so like the blast

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
radius that this attack had was

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,360
unprecedented

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
now it was a humbling moment for you

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
know for many involved in the software

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
development life cycle business myself

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
included

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
now look at these figures here uh

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,600
they're taken from

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,840
the synopsis open source security and

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,600
risk analysis report

54
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,159
made in 2022 this is made from by the

55
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,439
same company that

56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
makes the blackduck scanner you're

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
probably familiar with

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
uh you know there's there's a number of

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
interesting findings there and there's a

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,079
link you know when you get to see the

61
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
slide there's a link to the report there

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
but the two metrics that uh sort of like

63
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
caught my attention uh were these two

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
you know look at them

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,560
that means that

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
3 4 of

67
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,400
all the code bases that were audited

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
which means that you know code bases

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
from all sorts of companies you know not

70
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
just from you know software development

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
companies but this is like from all

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
industries and all geographies

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
three fourth of their code base is open

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,680
source software

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
this means that three-fourth of

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
their code base is software you know

77
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
pulled in from github pulled in from all

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
sorts of sources

79
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,519
and 81 of that code is at least

80
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,000
vulnerable with one vulnerability now if

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,760
you stop for a second and think about

82
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
your own stack think about how deep is

83
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
your stack like all the dependencies

84
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
you're relying on you know if if you if

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
you look at the blast radius it can it

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
can so like impact your your company if

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
one of these dependencies get attacked

88
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,319
in some way and we had recently that

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
example i mean think about what happened

90
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,599
with luck for jay

91
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,680
you know that can make

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
that can make or break companies

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
sometimes

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
and there are so many attack vectors too

95
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
in the supply in the modern development

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
lifestyle and the modern supply s

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
software supply chain you know you could

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
have actors submitting you know

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
malicious code changes to the repo if

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
you don't have like you know strong

101
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,959
uh you know review mechanism you can

102
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,480
have you know your build platform

103
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
compromised from the inside or by an

104
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
attacker externally which by the way is

105
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,159
what happened to solarwinds and you know

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,879
an example before uh you can even have

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,799
you know malicious package maintainers

108
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
you're depending on like some random

109
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
packets out of the in from the internet

110
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,239
and this package maintainer you know

111
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,920
maybe out of spite or you know out of

112
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,840
protest sometimes and we've seen that

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
with the war in ukraine recently they

114
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
can either wipe out their dependency

115
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,640
from the face of the earth and it's not

116
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
going to be available anymore or can

117
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
embed you know

118
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,239
back doors even in the code

119
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,920
and if you don't know if you don't do

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,439
anything about it then you end up with

121
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,040
backdoors in your code in your shipping

122
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
code now it's obviously easy for me to

123
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
point out the problem uh the reality is

124
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,640
that as engineers we tend to value so

125
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
like you know velocity and you know

126
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,519
making progress

127
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,200
way more than we value compliance in

128
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,319
general i mean

129
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
i'm guilty of that myself

130
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
so we deal with compliance only when we

131
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
have to

132
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,759
which is usually uh when you have

133
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,199
somebody knocking on your door which is

134
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,798
usually the security team or the legal

135
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,240
team if things get worse uh back in 2017

136
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,840
it was the architect for

137
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
uh product at vmware

138
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,199
and i was dealing with license

139
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
compliance we have a large code base in

140
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
go and we had a number of obviously

141
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
number of packages there and go is as

142
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
many of you know is a at least back then

143
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
it was you can only get statically

144
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
compiled binaries so it means that you

145
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
have to like scrutiny your licenses

146
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
because some licenses are incompatible

147
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,880
with each other

148
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
and we're trying to make our cicd tool

149
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
smarter to like you know catch a

150
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
licensed creep early on so i built a

151
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
tool and i went to a conference in paris

152
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
called go to present it

153
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
it's still available on youtube if you

154
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
check it out

155
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
and

156
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,039
at the time i was saying you know

157
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,800
there's actually two more than 2 000

158
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,360
packages this slides from 2017. there's

159
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,840
more to 2000

160
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,919
packages made with go that are gpl2

161
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,080
license mean that means that this is

162
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,400
like a hat scratcher for a lot of you

163
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,199
know legal teams and especially in

164
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,479
product companies that are building

165
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,840
products to sell

166
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,600
so i can start tackling some of these

167
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
you know fundamental issues and the

168
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,960
software supply chain these days now

169
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,400
it's hard to like pinpoint to a single

170
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
solution but

171
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
you know there are ways to do this and

172
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,160
software builder materials is probably

173
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,960
not

174
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,759
know nothing new is concept but it's

175
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,320
you know it it caught a lot more so like

176
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
attention and you know in the past three

177
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,039
four years

178
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,560
uh mostly because of the attacks that i

179
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
was talking about before

180
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,080
and it has sort of like started

181
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,720
accelerating the adoption of you know

182
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
these concepts and these practices

183
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,280
and to me the important shift here that

184
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
has to happen is sort of like moving

185
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
away from the you know what i was

186
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,199
calling the compliance because you have

187
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,160
to

188
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,680
to sort of like the compliance because

189
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
you want to because you want to be

190
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,240
compliance because it means creating a

191
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,960
virtuous cycle where you know a flywheel

192
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,319
where you have you know there are

193
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,240
tangible benefits in adopting something

194
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
like this for everybody involved not

195
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
just for a legal team you know being

196
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
able to sleep at night

197
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
so but what goes inside is an s-bomb so

198
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,639
there's a number of competing standards

199
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,360
for s-bomb there's uh there's spd-x

200
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,039
which is backed by linux foundation

201
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,639
there's cyclone dx there's a bunch of

202
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
other uh standards out there but they're

203
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
not very opinionated in what goes inside

204
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,199
an s bomb they're just opinionated in

205
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
the in the type of like in the way it is

206
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
described but not in the way that you're

207
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,160
putting information inside that so right

208
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,880
now it's not like a common belief that

209
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
you know having vulnerability scan

210
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,360
results the license audit uh the

211
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
metadata on the build system that i

212
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
actually built the artifact uh all the

213
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,639
dependencies that are involved in so

214
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
like building that specific piece of

215
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
code that specific piece of artifact

216
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
and so like the relationship that exists

217
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
between the components that are actually

218
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,360
built

219
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,280
you know it's so like an acceptable you

220
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,440
know list of information to generate you

221
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
know a viable set of tangible benefits

222
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
to the teams involved and why why is

223
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
that because you can identify you know

224
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
vulnerabilities that are known

225
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
you can you know count and manage your

226
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
license which was you know my original

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
use case for something like this uh you

228
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
can identify compliance you know

229
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
obviously at the license and security

230
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
level because you have both information

231
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,280
available to you

232
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
and you can start evaluating and

233
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,080
quantify the risk of your software as a

234
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
whole

235
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
and most importantly it's also

236
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,360
forward-looking because by having a list

237
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,879
of all the things that you and all the

238
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,080
components that you have all the

239
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
dependencies that you have in your

240
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,319
software

241
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
it means that when there's a new cv

242
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
coming out or a new you know security

243
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
problem that to mitigate you actually

244
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
have a list of things you can go and

245
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
check on and say okay i have you know

246
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
out of the entire software state that i

247
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
have you know i'm using this library

248
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,440
that is vulnerable in all these software

249
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
packets so i can go and fix them and

250
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
know exactly where to go instead of

251
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,199
trying to scramble and you know audit

252
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,199
the code base when there's a day zero

253
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
out there that is sort of like you know

254
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
uh impacting you

255
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
now if you take a step back you know now

256
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
we have s-bomb in our toolbox you know

257
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
let's take a step back and look at how

258
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,879
that fits into uh so like the overall

259
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,720
security of the system now having an

260
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
s-bomb generator is great it's fantastic

261
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,639
but there are several points where the

262
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,960
supply chain can actually be attacked

263
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,840
now

264
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
you know securing all this is obviously

265
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
hard and it's you know probably there

266
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
are team entire teams dedicated to

267
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
fixing this problem many companies you

268
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
know vmware included

269
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
now

270
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,599
but how do we do that it's actually

271
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,240
pretty hard so there are two so like

272
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
frameworks that are so like standing out

273
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
these days one of them is the salsa

274
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
framework which was uh you know

275
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,519
initiated by google and so like you know

276
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
something that is you know

277
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
something that is there's a lot of buzz

278
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
around it right now and also there's

279
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
like the os proactive control framework

280
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
they can help you integrate you know

281
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
practices and automation into your

282
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
supply chain trying to leveraging the

283
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
same platform and tools that you know

284
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
your developers and your sre teams are

285
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
also using so like creating a connection

286
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,120
between the two and so like adding sec

287
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
into your devops cycle into your devops

288
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,800
practices

289
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
now work in this area is still pretty

290
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
nascent if you look at especially if you

291
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,279
look at salsa salsa has four levels uh

292
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
level one and two are pretty well

293
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
defined three and four not so much so

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,519
if you're a security expert if you're a

295
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,880
security practitioner and you're

296
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,560
interested in this i would suggest you

297
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,600
to like go check out salsa which is l s

298
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,279
l s a dot ave and you know take a look

299
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
because it's it's interesting stuff

300
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
uh and in closing i know i'm over time

301
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,800
already but i'm trying to wrap up early

302
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
as much as possible so how do you get

303
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
started today now

304
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
uh so joe joe bida is one of the

305
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,240
kubernetes co-founder and

306
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
there's one line that i always use when

307
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,440
talking about kubernetes that i really

308
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
like which is kubernetes is a platform

309
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,480
platform

310
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
which means it's a platform to build

311
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
platforms now

312
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,079
what you see up here it's a set of tools

313
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
that are available today to so like

314
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
build your own secure supply chain

315
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
platform right

316
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,880
i want to highlight some some of these

317
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
notable examples here but there are many

318
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,480
more out there so

319
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
this is not like a complete lease by any

320
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
stretch of imagination so

321
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
if there's nothing here that fits what

322
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
you need go check out the cncf landscape

323
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,279
because there's likely a project that is

324
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,519
you know is built for you

325
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,320
so

326
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,680
let's quickly look over you know what we

327
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
have here in total performs at the

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
station so

329
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
it which is basically authenticated

330
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
metadata on

331
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
for your software artifacts so while

332
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
you're building your software you create

333
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
at the station and then you see you

334
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
cryptographically sign them and you

335
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,360
basically take them along your your

336
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
secure pipeline

337
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
you have you know cartographer which is

338
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
a choreographer so like similar concept

339
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,920
to orchestration for secure supply chain

340
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
this works in conjunction with you know

341
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,240
and task executioner like you know

342
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
techton or even jenkins and then you

343
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
have six store which is you know toolkit

344
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
for automatic signing and verification

345
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
of artifacts and if you looked at the

346
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
recent you know release of kubernetes

347
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
124 kubernetes 124 is the first release

348
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
that is signed and can be verified using

349
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
six store so go check it out

350
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,760
uh and as i mentioned earlier there's

351
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
salsa and osp as a security framework

352
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,399
again go check them out uh and last but

353
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,040
not least oppa which is pretty famous

354
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,399
and i'm sure that if you're running a

355
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,160
kubernetes cluster in production there's

356
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,440
a pretty high chance you're already

357
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,079
running oppa or open policy agent for

358
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
enforcing policies out there it's gonna

359
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
be extremely useful also for creating

360
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
secure supply chain

361
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
i hope this was helpful and

362
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
you know hopefully also informative in a

363
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,800
in a way uh good luck in securing your

364
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
pipelines and

365
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
have a great time here in valencia thank

366
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
you

367
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,160
you
