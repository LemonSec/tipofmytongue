1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
welcome to uh security con by cntf tech

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,560
security

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:04,930
um

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,879
[Music]

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,559
we're gonna have events over two days

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,639
which you probably already know about uh

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,920
so fun facts there's a ctf going on and

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,519
i did not

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,680
did we hear it back andreas did we hear

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,840
back when is what days are the ctfs

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
going on

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
okay we'll get into the c-types in a

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,800
second

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,880
uh so lewis is going to talk more about

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,199
ctfs uh there's a talk later today about

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,679
that so ctfs are a great way to get

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,600
started with stuff so if you're new here

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,120
if you want to

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,040
start learning stuff that's a ctaps are

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,800
a great way

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,640
you know we often talk about being alone

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,239
in our basement so we can be alone in

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,920
our basements together so that's a fun

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,680
thing

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
um

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:49,840
so

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,160
when we were preparing this this little

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
opening

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,520
section uh the organizers were asking me

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,879
i was asking the organizers what should

31
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
i talk about and they were asking well

32
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,960
why what do you like what do you find

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
interesting about security and what i

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,000
said is

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
well security is kind of hilarious

36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,400
because there's a bunch of stuff that

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,360
um

38
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,479
there's a bunch of stuff that most

39
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,640
people don't know or don't think about

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,119
and the results are often unexpected

41
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,960
which is what i find humorous but the

42
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,759
problem is when unexpected things happen

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,119
people get fined uh there's you know

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,799
security audits that kind of stuff

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
sometimes it doesn't work out that's a

46
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,360
problem

47
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,439
so we need to make sure that things work

48
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,439
we need to be able to

49
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,200
think about things proactively so that

50
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,720
other people don't have to especially

51
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
when it comes to security

52
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,159
now that's

53
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
that's a bit of a hot topic here because

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
we often get the sense that a lot of

55
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,079
developers especially developers are not

56
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,320
a big fan of security uh and the reason

57
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
is because

58
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
there's too much going on for everybody

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
i'm sure all of you have too much going

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,240
on and every developer and every team

61
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
that you interact with they also have a

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
lot of stuff going on so

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,200
a lot of our jobs uh tends to be

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
getting out of people's way uh even

65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,040
though our jobs are important other

66
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,038
people's jobs are important but we try

67
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,120
as much as possible to

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
generate less work for other people and

69
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
i think that's a very important thing so

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,319
a trend that we see emerge not emerge

71
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
but get more and more

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,120
visibility is automating security and i

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
find that super interesting i find it

74
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
super important because we remove the

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
human element we make sure that things

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,640
work by default instead of working

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
because we made everybody as paranoid as

78
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
we are

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
so there's a lot of talks about that

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
about automating things so uh fabio uh

81
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,200
who is a co-worker of mine at vmware uh

82
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,239
he's gonna talk about devsecops which is

83
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,160
one of those one of the ways to automate

84
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,319
uh how security works

85
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,000
uh we're going to hear about fuzzing

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,319
we're going to hear about uh argo cd

87
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,160
which uh i think there was a big

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
vulnerability or something which is very

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,040
interesting

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,640
we're going to have talks about policy

91
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
binary signing and so on so lots of ways

92
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
to automate things to make sure that

93
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
things work without having to make

94
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
everyone an expert in our subject matter

95
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,920
which i think at the end of the day is

96
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
the goal is to make sure things work

97
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
without everybody having to worry about

98
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
everyone else's area of expertise

99
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
so if you're interested in getting more

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,239
involved in this community uh i think

101
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
we often work in silos which is not the

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
healthiest thing in the world so if

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
you're interested in working more as a

104
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
community uh make sure to talk to your

105
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
peers the people sitting next to you are

106
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
the community that you should be

107
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,159
involved with

108
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,799
do talk to the speakers after every talk

109
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,319
about the subjects that you find

110
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,760
interesting everybody here is super

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,959
approachable

112
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,239
there's a talk tomorrow by raga in which

113
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,680
she's going to mention

114
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
all the ways to get involved in cncf

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
tech security there's also kubernetes

116
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,159
dash security which is a

117
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,360
slightly different focus but point being

118
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
talk to talk to your peers talk to the

119
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,439
speakers talk to everybody let's work

120
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
together as a community

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,280
so

122
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
things here are very volunteer based um

123
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,159
it's not traditional infosec

124
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,599
which has lots of pros and cons but

125
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,200
dude let's try to work together

126
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,959
everything is uh very open very

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,358
transparent

128
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,720
um

129
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
so i'm gonna hand it off to fabio in a

130
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,240
second

131
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,199
and

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
i just wanted to wish everyone a great

133
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
