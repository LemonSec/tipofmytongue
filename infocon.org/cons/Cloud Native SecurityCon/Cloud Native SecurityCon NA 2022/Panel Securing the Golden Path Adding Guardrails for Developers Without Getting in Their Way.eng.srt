2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,680
good afternoon uh to everyone over here

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,620
uh Welcome to Cloud native security con

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,559
North America I've been you know a

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,260
moderator for this session and today we

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,880
are talking about securing the golden

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,680
path adding guardrails for the

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,500
developers without getting in their way

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,300
uh is it possible to increase both

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,939
agility and security we all know that's

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,980
an organization are driven to deliver

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,920
faster and security often get overlooked

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,620
so how organizations adopting Cloud

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,719
native best practices balance the

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
growing completely complexity of

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,219
securing modern applications against

17
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,020
it's something we have we've been

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,000
discussing for a long time but now the

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,760
industry is feeling the need to to you

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,940
know show the weight how security and

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,739
operation teams can collaborate for

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,539
providing developer with a secure golden

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,840
path so in today's session we will

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,660
definitely cover you know uh some of

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,940

security

69
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,819
um for at least the last uh six years

70
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,860
um and most recently at Barclays

71
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,540
director of security

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,940
um working with uh their Cloud security

73
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,060
program uh before that at HSBC

74
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,819
um helping to really uh build up their

75
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,440
Cloud security

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,480
um as they were just entering the cloud

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,860
on multiple platforms AWS Google uh

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,319
Microsoft and

79
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,599
um before that at JPMorgan

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,879
um so yeah so it could have been around

81
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,280
the financials of helping them either

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,040
you know develop the policies understand

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
what the new security controls and

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,720
Concepts were on cloud versus what the

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,120
you know traditional security paths were

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,800
so that's what I've been doing the last

87
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,040
few years thank goodness uh thanks to

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,140
the great introduction uh and I quickly

89
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,060
introduced myself as well I'm a Global

90
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,739
Technical leader with working as savient

91
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,620
I'm a co-chair with Cloud security

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Alliance and been also working on cncf

93
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,739
uh when in industry for 18 years have

94
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,959
been uh thoroughly come you know all

95
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,879
from cloud security identity and you

96
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,260
know what different disciplines of

97
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,360
information security so I'm looking

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,819
forward to have a great conversation

99
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,440
today uh with our fellow panelists and

100
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,200
to start the question you know we

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
no everyone talks about developer

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,819
experience so what does that mean and

103
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,879
why does it matter so uh Liz why can't

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,060
you start that and we can have a you

105
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,120
know good conversation on that topic

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,400
uh definitely so

107
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,860
um from what I've seen in terms of you

108
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,720
know being on the security aspects

109
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,460
before that

110
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,500
um I used to be a developer technical

111
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,220
architect myself right so my

112
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,860
um my the beginning of my journey was

113
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,419
really how do I secure my own

114
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,919
application

115
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,960
um how do I integrate all the the

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
various policies

117
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,500
um in terms of code scans pen testing

118
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,660
um you know running my own pen tests and

119
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,100
then setting up

120
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,900
um you know the environment for for pen

121
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,699
tests against it

122
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,380
um you know so I saw I saw the way it

123
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,360
was done previously when it was a lot of

124
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,580
ad hoc and manual doing your security

125
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,280
code scans on your machine yourself

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,540
um two as we were moving to cloud and as

127
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,780
um not just the developers but the

128
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,960
um you know the the technology started

129
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,580
to allow more of the you know ability to

130
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,979
bolt-on right ability to automate

131
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,840
ability to

132
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,780
um build into pipelines so so it's kind

133
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,460
of been a journey that I've seen on both

134
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,759
ends where the developers obviously have

135
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,979
taken on to

136
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,080
um you know building pipelines because

137
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,180
it facilitates everything on that on

138
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,759
that developer end I can I can build and

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,360
run my environment so much faster

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,699
um you know now with you know as

141
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,680
kubernetes started coming into the to

142
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
the picture and Cloud the same thing

143
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
that mentality to me was very developer

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,860
friendly

145
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,479
um it was a mentality where this is

146
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,940
great I can push out features without

147
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,360
having to rebuild a hold application I

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,840
can isolate and I easily identify which

149
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,560
parts of of my components of of

150
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,100
um of you know the aspects of my changes

151
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,259
what was going out

152
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,900
um the part that was lagging behind was

153
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,340
the security side because the security

154
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,880
still still was requiring you to scan

155
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,560
your whole application even though maybe

156
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,780
I was only updating you know a few

157
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,940
components here and there those are the

158
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,500
aspects where being on the security side

159
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,840
I have seen we have really been focusing

160
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,020
on right how do we as security Now

161
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,360
support the fact that yes you know

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,460
developers are going to you know they

163
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,319
can build now now that things are

164
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,880
automated they can build their

165
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,639
application four times five times ten

166
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,860
times right

167
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,180
for each of those times where you're

168
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,580
going to require a full security scan

169
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,840
right

170
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,780
um the the the parts that I've seen

171
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,000
where you know where the developer

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,979
experience and let's say the security

173
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,560
requirements are colliding it's that

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,860
it's it's is security enabling or are we

175
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,759
creating you know roadblocks time blocks

176
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,080
um you know I'm scanning thousands of

177
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,060
lines of code I'm telling you now that

178
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,240
you have thousands of non-compliance

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
lines of code

180
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,020
um what are all those requirements so so

181
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,639
I'll kind of just you know lead it up to

182
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,979
that like what where is it at where are

183
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,720
those challenges at

184
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,699
um what security and then obviously the

185
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,220
security teams working now with the

186
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,139
products that are out there saying guys

187
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,699
this is where we need your help right

188
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,800
because this is what this is what's

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,020
happening where we can't continue

190
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,539
creating these blocks or these slowdowns

191
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,120
for the developers however we we need to

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,699
ensure that the security is compliant we

193
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,740
need to ensure that developers have a

194
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,740
way to easily remediate those bugs to

195
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,819
easily remediate you know Sev One issues

196
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,720
um and and to still be able to push out

197
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,000
all of their features right so so in the

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,900
last few years I know a lot of people

199
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,160
talk about that it really is a

200
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,139
partnership of security doesn't want to

201
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,259
block you but security is I think more

202
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,960
recently being enabled by products in

203
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,539
the industry and so on to help

204
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,240
developers rather than hinder them right

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,060
absolutely no I totally agree yeah Anil

206
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,500
you're shaking ahead I think you have

207
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,379
something to share please yeah yeah I

208
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,780
mean you know ultimately developers you

209
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,560
know need the ability to have security

210
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,279
right be transparent and compliance be

211
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,799
transparent to enable them to do what

212
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,140
they do so effectively and do so well

213
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,620
which is develop applications that solve

214
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,140
real world business problems right so

215
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,980
you know by using golden paths and

216
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,200
having an internal development framework

217
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,019
right where you now have this is the way

218
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,480
that we develop applications and you

219
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,480
make security and compliance transparent

220
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,220
to the developer so that they can focus

221
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,740
on building those applications that add

222
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,320
value to deliver deliver and address

223
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,140
those issues that do arise in a quick

224
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,420
agile Manner and speed the time from

225
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,000
development to deployment right really

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,519
is kind of the thesis underpinning the

227
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
building paths but you know the piece

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,700
that should not be ignored which I think

229
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,920
is kind of you know the topic of

230
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,620
conversation today is the security of

231
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,200
those golden paths right and ensuring

232
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,480
that we have secured the golden paths

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,580
that we've baked in security and

234
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,459
compliance and made it real time made it

235
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,620
continuous and made it complete

236
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,959
yeah thank you uh Adele I think you're

237
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,519
absolutely right this is something it's

238
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,560
a continuous delivery process and

239
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,920
keeping a developer experiences you know

240
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,380
a motivational for the companies to you

241
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,140
know develop us to have developing a

242
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,200
good user experience and and and you

243
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,720
know feedback is one of the greatest you

244
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,240
know constantly or shaking around in

245
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,760
organization uh rather what do you think

246
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,459
about your experience on you know on on

247
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,620
developers and specifically how how does

248
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,899
it impact uh you know for the customers

249
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,459
you're working with from the end user

250
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,519
perspective so my perspective is

251
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,560
um all this technology cloud or Cloud

252
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,260
native everything is to ultimately

253
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,200
support business at business changes

254
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,360
very quickly

255
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
um developers have to be able to respond

256
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,339
to the changing Market needs very

257
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,260
quickly imagine a payment app right

258
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,940
there are new features you have

259
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,500
competitions they're coming up with new

260
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,180
features as a developer I want to

261
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,920
provide those features as quickly as

262
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,580
possible to my customer base how do I do

263
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,980
um so that plus there are regulatory

264
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,600
changes there are new regulations coming

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,180
in all areas not just security or

266
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,560
compliance there are other regulations

267
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,240
that they have to need they have to need

268
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,360
visibility needs for The Regulators so

269
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,940
the whole concept is that the developers

270
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,440
are key I mean in 2007 you can go to

271
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,300
YouTube and look at Steve baumer's

272
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,160
presentation on developers developers

273
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,380
developers right developer experiences

274
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,760
everything

275
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,220
um and how to facilitate that obviously

276
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,380
there is a lot of evolution that has

277
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,480
happened in the industry and evolution

278
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,880
is still continuing

279
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,560
um basically we want to leverage

280
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,019
economies of scale the common security

281
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,060
controls need to be built into their

282
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,399
platforms right and then the individual

283
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,440
application developers should not have

284
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,660
to worry about infrastructure whatsoever

285
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,519
or what was or what VL do I need to

286
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,140
deploy hence the serverless

287
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,120
architectures in the market today right

288
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,579
away so that they can just develop

289
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,740
application functionality and deploy it

290
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,560
yeah it still has to be built as part of

291
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,600
that so uh we will talk a little more

292
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,660
about what and there are rails and paid

293
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,700
ways and gold attacks mean out on that

294
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,880
absolutely uh Jim why don't you share

295
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,820
your thoughts about developer experience

296
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,459
sure yeah and being you know a developer

297
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,600
myself

298
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,360
um it's interesting to see the evolution

299
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,579
just over the last few decades right

300
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,980
because like aradna mentioned we went

301
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,380
you know from a time where bills which

302
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,120
actually you would have to submit a bill

303
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
in the evening and wait till the next

304
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,500
day to get that build back right and

305
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,300
that was you know the developer

306
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,399
experience but today within seconds

307
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,500
we're expecting things to be pushed into

308
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,079
production in a secure and compliant

309
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,839
manner so like a Radnor was also

310
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,180
mentioning uh today of course every

311
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,880
business is a digital business

312
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,320
businesses that can deliver faster will

313
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,779
win it's that simple right and how do

314
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,579
you deliver faster well you need to

315
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,120
create the right developer experiences

316
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,860
with the right security guard rails in

317
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,579
place policies compliance Etc but in a

318
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,440
manner that's completely transparent to

319
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,240
Developers

320
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,220
um but but and empowers them to deliver

321
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,959
faster

322
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,399
um the other interesting Trend we're

323
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,260
seeing along with things like golden

324
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,380
passes also the rise of platform teams

325
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,740
right who are their sole purpose is to

326
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,700
service developers within an Enterprise

327
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,820
absolutely I think you're you're right

328
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,519
this is something uh as around I

329
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,620
mentioned and I conquer with YouTube as

330
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,720
well understanding what customers want

331
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,420
and needs is crucial you know that's the

332
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,120
that's a way to provide a experience and

333
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,980
ensuring the code whatever we are

334
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,779
writing specifically it's our high

335
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,019
quality you know that's uh the way we

336
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,399
are improving our experience the product

337
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,079
productivity also increases as a time

338
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,480
when team realizes that this is

339
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,279
necessary for the project or for the

340
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,839
Innovation that they need to do in

341
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,540
developing software so yeah good point

342
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,540
uh let's move to the you know uh my

343
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,160
second question for the panel over here

344
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,160
is what are the golden parts and how can

345
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,980
they help you know in in securing uh you

346
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,959
know what how we can improve that

347
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,420
specifically in our Trails more what

348
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,519
we're talking over here uh Jim why can't

349
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,620
you start with you first

350
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,920
sure um yeah so to me quite simply a

351
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,839
golden path is how do you get from zero

352
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,200
to production as quickly as possible in

353
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,019
a secure compliant manner right and and

354
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,639
this of course

355
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,339
um is not an easy task or an easy feat

356
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,500
so whether you want to deploy an

357
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,720
application or maybe a database service

358
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,360
or something else just having the

359
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,019
recipes for this which can be followed

360
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,940
um and which you know take care of the

361
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,639
proper guard rails but at the same time

362
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,940
allow that flexibility where required is

363
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,060
what a golden path would be

364
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,079
awesome so uh in order uh for the golden

365
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,500
part uh what can can I say that this

366
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,060
could be a series of questions and

367
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,339
answers or could be an offering at what

368
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,160
customers looking to solve over here so

369
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,740
uh right now what do you think from your

370
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,440
Viewpoint or what uh how how does that

371
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
golden path help in overall direction

372
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,800
that industry is right now going in

373
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,480
um think think threat landscape today

374
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,300
and an application developer it is

375
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,339
practically impossible for a developer

376
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,959
to know all the threats and

377
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,000
vulnerabilities in every possible

378
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
language operating system and the whole

379
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
stack right there are so many security

380
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,500
standards compliance standards

381
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,660
I will not be able to focus on my code

382
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,519
if I have to worry about all that right

383
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,399
so as platform Engineers or security

384
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,920
engineer another job is

385
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,240
to build these controls and pay the

386
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,699
paths in the platform itself

387
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,820
the Tooling in the cicd pipeline the

388
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,339
integration and policy enforcement so

389
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,019
when I'm trying to push my code I'm

390
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,880
automatically stopped if I'm not needing

391
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,199
certain policies

392
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,440
so that in addition to providing

393
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,120
guidance to the developers you know

394
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,980
training on threats and vulnerabilities

395
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,100
so if we build these controls I will not

396
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,320
be able to deviate from those Pathways

397
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,260
and my code will still be delivered and

398
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,779
will be secure and compliant so the

399
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,360
whole point is providing developers

400
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,880
those paved paths so that they they

401
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,980
cannot deviate from that like you go

402
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,079
hiking there's a Payback right you know

403
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,760
where you're going how you're going to

404
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,220
reach your assignment right similarly

405
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,620
um developers need

406
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,779
in the platform itself so that they can

407
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,000
deploy code securely and if they are not

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,579
meeting certain policies they start they

409
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,500
need to go fix the vulnerabilities or

410
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,720
they are not meeting certain policies

411
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,180
um and this has evolved quite a bit over

412
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,279
time right how security Integrated

413
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,800
Security tools integration and the whole

414
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,240
keyword of

415
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,800
um aspect of it right admission

416
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,600
controller is

417
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,300
um and there's progression being made in

418
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,860
the industry on supply chain security

419
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,259
right where you're going further into

420
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,480
getting the information about the

421
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,399
metadata of the third party software

422
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,959
components that you're integrating in

423
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,779
your software code everything is

424
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,520
connected these days

425
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,900
um and you're leveraging a lot of open

426
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,880
source and third-party libraries so how

427
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,919
do you make sure your code is still

428
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,040
secure so all these are

429
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,179
components added together the secure

430
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,280
platform the secure clcd Pipeline and

431
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,900
all the policy enforcement in the

432
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,480
pipeline shifts left and also provides a

433
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,099
Golden Empire for developers and

434
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,199
developer experience improvements and

435
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,459
efficiencies

436
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,700
thank you I think this is uh it looks

437
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,200
like an interesting discussion right now

438
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,419
Anil what friends you are seeing in your

439
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,760
like uh area specifically on the golden

440
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,580
pass and how does it impact the overall

441
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,400
experience over here yeah I mean you

442
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
know there's a there's been a lot of

443
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,679
conversation

444
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,660
um that that you know but Jim and rodna

445
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,179
have raised um you know in in their

446
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,820
points on this particular topic around

447
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,100
you know shift left and the complexity

448
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,740
of environments

449
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,160
um and the need to enable developers to

450
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,700
be able to deliver code quickly right

451
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,620
instead of waiting for a bill to happen

452
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,960
overnight instead of worrying about the

453
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
security and compliance requirements of

454
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,400
the code being able to ship code in

455
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,059
minutes not days and weeks is can

456
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,799
absolutely Mission critical to meet the

457
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,039
needs of the business now with that said

458
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,700
you following golden paths help you make

459
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,100
that happen quickly in large complex

460
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,200
organ organizations because you have a

461
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,780
recipe for how it should be done

462
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,100
leveraging for example an IDP and

463
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,559
internal development platform right or

464
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,600
you know different paths for you know

465
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,580
different different organizations you

466
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,140
know with that said those patterns need

467
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,419
to be extensible right technology and

468
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,539
tooling changes at a rapid Pace there's

469
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,460
new technologies coming in and out of

470
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,940
organizations daily right so as this

471
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,940
shift left movement takes hold to enable

472
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,580
and Empower developers to build great

473
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,340
software make sure that those golden

474
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,980
paths have the right guard rails to

475
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,900
employ and enforce security and

476
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,600
compliance yet be extensible

477
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,240
to allow new technologies to be brought

478
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,960
in to help enable and secure and the

479
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,340
Enterprise

480
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,039
absolutely uh if you made a right point

481
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,919
about you know how we basically get

482
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,620
onboarding or the create and process

483
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,380
something which requires a minimal

484
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,660
Integrations suppose you know we are

485
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,120
doing a CI CD pipelining integration or

486
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,100
operational control system or any kind

487
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,100
of a static code analysis that that that

488
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,419
way getting the right set of offerings

489
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,000
specifically for the customer intent to

490
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,280
be done over there is to get an

491
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,320
observability capability what is baked

492
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
in over there So yeah thank you so much

493
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,820
for sharing your videos uh Liz what

494
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,679
about yourself like what friends you are

495
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,660
seeing in your area specifically and and

496
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,720
how you manifest allow those you know

497
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
specifically while deploying the

498
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,960
applications yeah what um in in terms of

499
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,679
a a golden path what we're seeing more

500
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,480
and more of in

501
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,980
um what like the ask for for various

502
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,120
vendors

503
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
um even especially in the last couple

504
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,039
years uh has really been the well this

505
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,020
is great that you can help me automate

506
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,840
the policies but even let's say running

507
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,200
these um these security code scans uh

508
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,419
let's say every time you push a build to

509
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,360
diver test even at that point it gets

510
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,100
burdensome right

511
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,400
um which is why the request now has been

512
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,700
can we you know uh can you help us scan

513
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,559
the code at you know within the IDE

514
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,200
environments right can we plug in those

515
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
policies so that it's visible to the

516
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,580
developer so that as a developer is

517
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,140
building the code building those module

518
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,100
changes they can start seeing and be

519
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,799
notified of you know this code right

520
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,900
here that you've just written is you

521
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
know potentially going to violate the

522
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,340
following policy and even sometimes

523
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,799
having those you know um those code

524
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,600
fixes right their recommendations right

525
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,240
this this is how you can fix this

526
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,160
um because like so the challenge that

527
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,380
that I would see was as a security team

528
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,799
do you do you Leverage The okay well you

529
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,020
know do you run let's say these

530
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,580
particular scans

531
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,260
um like once daily right because because

532
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,600
sometimes when it gets plugged in like I

533
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
said it gets run you know oh we're going

534
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,580
to scan it every build well again that

535
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,260
gets burdensome on the business because

536
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,140
now you're potentially adding you know

537
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,299
minutes and and then potentially

538
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,720
stopping right a push to an environment

539
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,280
um depending on the errors every single

540
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,720
time and like I said developer teams

541
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,700
want to be able to build and push to Dev

542
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,520
let's say multiple times in a day right

543
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,960
um and maybe some of those fixes are

544
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,720
actually fixes for you know security

545
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,340
requirements

546
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,960
um so they're pushing multiple times a

547
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,179
day so sometimes even myself I was like

548
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,159
you know is it more efficient to be able

549
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,620
to leverage and say okay uh these scans

550
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,440
will run let's say once every day so the

551
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,940
let's say the first bill to that

552
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,620
environment that's one way to approach

553
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,320
depending on which which scan it is but

554
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,240
I see the

555
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,320
um you know

556
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
um if it's a scan let's say for the the

557
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,940
infrastructure for the environment then

558
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,580
that you know let's say that makes sense

559
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,840
um or that might be every time because

560
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,340
you don't change the infrastructure so

561
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,559
much so much but when it comes to the

562
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,320
code itself I am seeing that the way we

563
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,360
can help developers the most is really

564
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,580
integrating it during that development

565
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,000
cycle during that design cycle right as

566
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,880
we can apply policies to their design as

567
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,220
we can apply policies to their

568
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,320
development so it's not a surprise to

569
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
them later on now they've you know

570
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,919
designed this up this application now

571
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,960
they've built all this code and now

572
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,760
you're telling me Oh you have all the

573
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,559
you have a problem in all of these areas

574
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,780
right and all of these lines of code I

575
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,480
think that's why the let's say the

576
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,159
burden on development team has been so

577
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,260
great because security has come in

578
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,120
further down and I know that security

579
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,740
teams have been saying we're going to

580
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,419
shift left we're going to shift left the

581
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,020
challenges have been how right how what

582
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,360
where's the tooling capability you know

583
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,340
how do we integrate these policies and

584
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,480
so on

585
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,039
um that has really been the challenge

586
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,500
for security is because a lot of the

587
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,020
tooling you know previously has been the

588
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,240
oh you can scan it once you get to this

589
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,580
environment right you can require it at

590
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,440
this step it was still at later steps

591
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,220
yeah thank you so much Liz I think we

592
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,020
made a very good point about you know

593
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,000
how he's building a ship left and

594
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,679
developers normally don't shift life

595
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,620
their experience is more security is

596
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,480
we're talking more from the ship level

597
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,539
perspective so uh thanks for sharing

598
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,940
your views on that so uh Anil I'll come

599
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,400
to you about you know some of the design

600
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,559
principles and what what common

601
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,900
templates or unique to your each

602
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,820
organization specifically for red scale

603
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,039
what do you think are some common

604
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,260
templates that you are building for your

605
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,820
organization and what your how your

606
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,500
customers are helping and taking care of

607
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,500
that yeah I mean you know in the vein of

608
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,120
you know kind of templates and guard

609
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,220
rails you know you know there there are

610
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,740
you know definitely it comes back to the

611
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,880
type of data that you're trying to

612
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,480
protect and the type of organization

613
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,280
um and its security and compliance

614
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,960
requirements for that organization

615
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
different organizations have different

616
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,460
requirements financial institutions for

617
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,220
example are beholden to some very

618
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,440
stringent regulatory requirements

619
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,419
Healthcare institutions completely

620
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,820
different regulatory requirements right

621
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,000
but somewhat analogous right and then

622
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,500
you've got some organizations that have

623
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,480
very little regulatory requirements so

624
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,820
understanding kind of two things a

625
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,620
before you pick a template and say okay

626
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,020
we're going to go and put the same thing

627
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,640
on everything and just assume it's all

628
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,840
going to work and everything's going to

629
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,880
be great that's not necessarily true

630
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,860
right because every organization is just

631
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,480
a little bit different and it should be

632
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,000
so first understand what type of data

633
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,679
are you entrusted to protect within that

634
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,840
application right what are you who are

635
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,400
you serving what kind of data are you

636
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,740
trying to protect right whether it's

637
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,480
internally or externally

638
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,460
secondly what are the security and

639
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,500
regulatory requirements that that

640
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
organization is beholden to right once

641
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,419
you have answers to those questions you

642
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,280
can then select from Alexa kind of

643
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,279
templates that meet those requirements

644
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,799
and establish those guard rails for that

645
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,860
organization whether it be nist 853

646
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,100
whether it be CSA CCM whether it be

647
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,919
HIPAA whether it be gdpr or I'm using

648
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,779
regulator for requirements right but you

649
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,240
know whatever they might be establishing

650
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,179
those you know what kind of data are we

651
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,620
trying to protect

652
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,059
what are the requirements of the

653
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,159
organization and then deciding what

654
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,039
templates that I need to go apply helps

655
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,220
you then develop applications that are

656
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,679
secure and compliant As you move through

657
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,020
the pipeline right pushing those ideas

658
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,900
into the IDE where it makes sense right

659
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,820
but then in having the right

660
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,220
tools in the pipeline to do those scans

661
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,799
do those both security and compliance

662
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,020
checks so on the code exits a pipeline

663
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,000
in the environment you can validate yeah

664
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,380
we've shifted laptop security and

665
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,200
compliance this code is good to go

666
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,860
great absolutely I think uh made a right

667
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,600
uh uh remark on specifically what how

668
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
those common templates be here you know

669
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,700
a unique league and uh Benchmark against

670
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,580
different uh security requirement data

671
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,260
coming out from the regulation or from

672
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,299
the uh you know from from the industry

673
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,460
specifically Jim what do you think about

674
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,700
uh how you uh the organization

675
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,580
specifically at taking care of for you

676
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,140
know designing those common templates

677
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,659
and how it's Unique to your organization

678
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,360
yeah one interesting Trend you know of

679
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,700
course with kubernetes becoming the most

680
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,860
popular container orchestration system

681
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,039
today it itself you know provides a

682
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,500
layer of standardization across more you

683
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,179
know any infrastructure any cloud

684
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,360
provider and gives developers a set of

685
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,580
standard interfaces to deploy manage

686
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,159
their applications right the kubernetes

687
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,559
also has been designed to be extensible

688
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,900
so I mean we've been discussing golden

689
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,260
paths it's a great example of how a set

690
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,539
of complex orchestration scheduling

691
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:27,659
behaviors can be codified can be offered

692
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,820
as a standard but with the right

693
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,179
extensibility through its declarative

694
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:35,039
configuration management and what we see

695
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,419
over there is because of that

696
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,480
extensibility uh kubernetes policy

697
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,240
engines like taverno we have over like

698
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,640
200 You Know sample policies in our

699
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,159
community library four best practices

700
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,100
for security for Automation and for

701
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,919
other things right so this itself

702
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,260
creates a good library of these standard

703
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,600
templates which really enables

704
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,480
developers so now if you know if a

705
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,580
developer wants to create a kubernetes

706
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,799
deployment and perhaps they're new to

707
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,779
kubernetes they don't have to think

708
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,720
about all the details they're told right

709
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,380
away in Native tools that maybe the Pod

710
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,679
requires some health checks or probes or

711
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,260
other configurations which are best

712
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,140
practices in kubernetes so that you know

713
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,779
is now made possible by these type of

714
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,140
digital platforms and systems which just

715
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,120
even five years ago we didn't have that

716
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,600
those advantages or capabilities

717
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,520
absolutely

718
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,620
so moving into the next question about

719
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,980
you know specifically uh maybe uh right

720
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,620
now you can take that question how how

721
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,360
should opposition go about securing the

722
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,000
golden pass what top security concerns

723
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,140
you know they should address

724
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,840
specifically I will just come to get

725
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,020
your point from uh you know from the end

726
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,179
of your perspective

727
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,120
yeah so um obviously like I've mentioned

728
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,480
it's really important to have

729
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,760
that's right every Enterprise is a

730
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,860
multi-cloud Enterprise today

731
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,720
um by choice or by they've been forced

732
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,240
into it because they bought the

733
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,539
you know SAS usage has increased over

734
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,820
time as well and so it's a complex

735
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,539
ecosystem a cloud cloud native SAS and

736
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,279
pass Services

737
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,200
um and some of it is managed platforms

738
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
some of them you have to manage yourself

739
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,740
so

740
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,020
based on the risk tolerance of the

741
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,179
organization it's really important to

742
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,820
Define what those Baseline controls are

743
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,039
going to be in all platforms regardless

744
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,760
of who is using what application and

745
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,320
considering cloud and Cloud native

746
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,880
platforms already provides you

747
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,120
capabilities to micro segment right

748
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,520
making sure your your isolating all your

749
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,500
applications and you have controls in

750
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,480
the platform itself

751
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,159
um infrastructure as code when you're

752
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,500
deploying uh you know a VPC or something

753
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,500
and appropriate security groups the next

754
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,779
is the common security controls identity

755
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,580
and access management every application

756
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,919
every component is every service every

757
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,659
apis that I need identity and access

758
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,700
management right

759
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,760
um then obviously Asset Management how

760
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,200
are you going to manage all your assets

761
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,960
the cloud platform assets as well as the

762
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,460
application networklers that are going

763
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,220
to utilize the platform uh detection and

764
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,140
response right how are you going to

765
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,539
detect there are some Cloud native tools

766
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,000
available from the cloud providers but

767
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,919
they may be insufficient in some cases

768
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,299
you want to layer on additional

769
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,000
detection tools like Cloud security

770
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,940
posture management tools which are

771
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,100
context aware that can provide you you

772
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,840
know the pulse of their platform itself

773
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,720
so that is giving you economies of scale

774
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,480
right all applications services we'll

775
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,340
use common platforms you can have tools

776
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,659
to scan

777
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,880
um CIS benchmarks your image management

778
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,600
flows Etc everything your repos you know

779
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,880
making sure your peoples are scanned you

780
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,559
have a proper segregation of Duties and

781
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,419
the repos and all that and then comes to

782
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,299
cicd pipeline that is common to multiple

783
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,399
applications so you whatever controls

784
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,980
you want to build comment controls you

785
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,720
know obviously there may be some unique

786
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,700
applications which have unique policies

787
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,679
but still you can have your policy Depot

788
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,960
and um scanning tools can be integrated

789
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,480
then you have bug bars right you enforce

790
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,580
those bars through the cic defendants

791
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,679
there there are some pain points still

792
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,020
that need to be mitigated in the

793
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,240
pipeline for the Developers for example

794
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,640
code scanning tools come up with a lot

795
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,140
of vulnerabilities

796
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,360
right how do you prioritize them and

797
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,159
based on the risk tolerance of your

798
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,260
organization you might need a mapping of

799
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,720
you know what may be considered high in

800
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,940
the industry or what may be considered

801
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,760
moderate in the industry in your

802
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,200
organization's restaurant that is fine

803
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,840
so that mapping and then providing

804
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
developers guidances to which are the

805
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,740
highest criticality minibilities they

806
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,720
need to address before they can migrate

807
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,919
forward

808
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,080
so these are the common controls that

809
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,360
can be built into the platform and cicd

810
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,580
pipelines and forcing all their policies

811
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,899
and controls

812
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,240
um as a Baseline and from there you can

813
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,679
continue to enhance you know other

814
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,520
controls and policies great thanks I

815
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,360
think uh uh you're right so uh anel uh

816
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,220
just quick uh you know to be mindful

817
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,260
about the time over here uh what what do

818
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,940
you what are the some of the Guard fails

819
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,760
you know specifically uh it can be uh

820
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,799
implied over here to bridge the security

821
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,360
and compliance what do you think over

822
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,399
there I'm gonna double click on what a

823
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,520
rodna said uh around controls

824
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,740
um around apis having that standard

825
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,020
Baseline and the mappings right so

826
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,179
um and then weave that all in with a new

827
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,799
standard that came out from Mist called

828
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,600
open security controls assessment

829
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,240
language right there's this big movement

830
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,960
of compliances code and trying to

831
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,000
establish compliances code leveraging a

832
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,980
common standard or lexicon so nist has

833
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,899
kind of taken the lead there

834
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,520
um in collaboration with fedramp and

835
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,220
created this new machine readable

836
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,120
language that allows you to express

837
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,039
those common controls across multiple

838
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,500
catalogs in a standardized schema and

839
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,120
the associated assessments of those

840
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,880
trolls and the results of those controls

841
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,100
and the issues and and whatnot right all

842
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,279
in one standard XML or Json file right

843
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,440
as opposed to a 600 page word docs that

844
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,580
you have to do scare and compare

845
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,799
exercises against right not helpful for

846
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,840
anyone so so you know from that

847
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,700
standpoint you know really the the rise

848
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,460
of the API economy being able to

849
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,640
exchange information between systems

850
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,760
right allowing security tools to now

851
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,519
talk to compliance tools right

852
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,000
leveraging an api-centric platform

853
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,980
leveraging a CI CD pipeline so as code

854
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,779
goes through this pipeline you can

855
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,720
establish here's the controls that

856
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,600
matter to me right here's the standard

857
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,159
Baseline here's the mapping of those

858
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,860
controls to other standard catalogs and

859
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,200
Frameworks here's the security scans

860
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,640
that come in

861
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,100
take those hands feed them to your

862
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,500
compliance tool right in our case we're

863
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,060
at scale but you know whatever tool you

864
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,820
might use right and output

865
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,020
your documentation as code oscow right

866
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,599
that allows you to truly shift left

867
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,879
security and compliance leveraging

868
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,000
standards like Nest oscow push a button

869
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,820
and you can make compliances code real

870
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,000
great absolutely uh Jim what do you

871
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,560
think about the from the policies

872
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,440
perspective uh how uh what are the top

873
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,960
security concerns and how specifically

874
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,839
organization can you know secure those

875
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,239
yeah so every survey that's out there

876
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,159
about security talks about you know

877
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,199
misconfigurations being the number one

878
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,359
problem right so starting with that

879
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,119
addressing that right up front is is a

880
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,839
big win and policies digital policies uh

881
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,839
of course codified in kubernetes

882
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,580
um you know and enforced at admission

883
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,400
time as well as runtime can help

884
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
dramatically with that and then tying in

885
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,440
other processes you know like you know

886
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,900
vulnerability management other things

887
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,180
into a kubernetes and Cloud native way

888
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,700
of doing things so you know making sure

889
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,760
git Ops tooling is available git becomes

890
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,520
the new system of record and kubernetes

891
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,160
becomes a new system of Engagement for

892
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,540
developers operators and security teams

893
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,540
great uh thank you so much everyone for

894
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,920
you know

895
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,859
discuss on a very crucial aspect on

896
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,200
securing the golden pass and what uh

897
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,240
concerns challenges stabilizations are

898
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,460
facing what can be done what cartwheels

899
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,160
can be implied uh thanks everyone for

900
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,140
participating in the last 10 minutes I

901
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,660
will have a quick q a and you know I

902
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,520
have a follow-up final remark from

903
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,000
everyone uh from each of the panelists

904
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,200
uh so I'll start with less uh you know a

905
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,480
quick question about you know what it

906
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,520
means the golden past for the hybrid and

907
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,960
multi-cloud environment what do you

908
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,000
think uh could be those pathways

909
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
um in terms of uh what I think in terms

910
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,520
so for me uh what a golden path truly

911
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,839
means right what we're trying to build

912
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,440
uh across organizations is it you know

913
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,060
golden means that it's golden for

914
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,460
everyone right golden means that

915
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,320
um like we said we can enable developers

916
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,000
to do their job

917
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,220
um we can enable compliance teams to

918
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,119
have the visibility of those um those

919
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,339
standards of how they're being met of

920
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:36,540
how

921
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,359
um of providing metrics so so one thing

922
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,280
that that we didn't bring up and and I

923
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,720
would I would say needs to be included

924
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,980
in that golden path is that

925
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,920
observability so as we're automating and

926
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,079
building everything in I believe that

927
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,099
we're

928
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,660
um also then able to build that

929
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,780
observability of you know I can I can

930
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,119
now prove that this application that's

931
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,619
internet facing

932
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,240
um or that this application that I need

933
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,820
to prove is missed compliant uh HIPAA

934
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,520
compliance PCI Compliant and so on I can

935
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,320
easily identify those rather than

936
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,800
relying on applications to self-identify

937
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,440
yes I'm an internet application yes I

938
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,020
have data that's impacted by gdpr yes I

939
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,480
have data that's impacted by PCI I think

940
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,900
that's also one of the benefits of

941
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,280
automating a building templates or

942
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,260
building policies is that you can then

943
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,540
build that observability and see how the

944
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,300
policies are being met see you know

945
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,480
maybe which policies are are failing

946
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,160
more across the board and so then

947
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,140
security teams can say you know why are

948
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,760
these failing more how can we enable

949
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,280
developers more how do we you know do we

950
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,260
need to provide more templates right I

951
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,400
know that that's one of the things with

952
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,720
that on that we've worked on in the past

953
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,780
is you know we've said we need to

954
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,400
um we need to put those templates out

955
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,040
there because then developers say okay I

956
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,140
know how to build a secure you know

957
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,700
environment

958
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,260
um you know that's going to be a

959
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,880
kubernetes environment that's going to

960
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,380
be a serverless environment that's going

961
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,820
to go to this Cloud environment and use

962
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,440
this Cloud product

963
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,300
um so yeah so I think observability

964
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,240
really really helps us across the board

965
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,540
thank you so much Liz so uh I know we

966
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,460
have been just slow on time so I will

967
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,859
have each one of you 30 seconds to

968
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,440
conclude and you know provide your

969
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,339
guidance and uh you know to to what

970
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,380
Cloud native leaders can look at the

971
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,599
organization can look into right now why

972
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,920
can't you start with our concluding

973
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,619
paperwork so everything Anil nurse and

974
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,480
Jim said is important

975
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,859
um in addition I would like to say

976
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,260
automation automation automation all

977
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,300
security policies all controls all

978
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,220
observability has to be automated no

979
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,260
manual Pathways thank you thank you Jim

980
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,300
yeah so you know I I think what we're

981
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,420
starting to see emerge here is again you

982
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,400
know leveraging systems like kubernetes

983
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,820
Cloud native processes like git Ops and

984
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,880
and really rethinking every every it

985
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,980
process that we've had in the past

986
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,579
around security compliance uh and moving

987
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,980
to the as code model right so leveraging

988
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,140
best practices of Version Control

989
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,380
automation some of these other items

990
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,140
okay thank you

991
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,020
so I'll end with an adage if you don't

992
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,820
know where you're going any path will

993
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,520
get you there so you know you really

994
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,579
leveraging a golden path and an

995
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,500
organization to say this is where we're

996
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,740
going bringing shift left into your

997
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,020
environment and making that real

998
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,900
leveraging automation

999
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,520
leveraging Technologies and capabilities

1000
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,460
and best practices to enable developers

1001
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,859
to solve real world problems at the

1002
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,020
speed of business that's the future and

1003
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,760
