um so the last couple of days we've been

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,840
running a CTF event here yesterday we

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,420
ran a couple of introduction workshops

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,540
and today we had an all-day event just a

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,060
couple of numbers on screen uh we had 50

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,500
clusters 80 Flags 11 hints

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,860
560 total points possible and 74 flag

so thanks everyone who played

um we welcome any feedback and if you're

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,420
interested in the solutions please come

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,099
and talk to us

63
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,019
thanks

64
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,239
excellent and thank you to metahertz for

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,580
choosing a genuine hacker name in the

66
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,200
context of the rest of the individuals

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760
right

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,040
let's talk briefly if you haven't heard

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,739
it before about tag security who we are

70
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,860
what we do and why we care so much about

71
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,500
trying to raise the bar for cloud native

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,700
security

73
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,400
we have a repository everything we do is

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,159
GitHub driven we are modern developer

75
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,980
flow focused we come from a practitioner

76
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,980
background instead of an abstract

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,680
ethereal security deployment stopping

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,840
background and really we're looking to

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
work with projects to enhance their

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,620
security and dispel some of the latter

81
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,680
old security practices which involve uh

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,159
perhaps floods fear of deployment

83
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,420
instead we prefer to deploy regularly

84
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
and enshrine modern development

85
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,599
practices

86
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,299
so what does that mean it means we are a

87
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,340
voluntary and community-based

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,500
organization of course the Linux

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,440
Foundation runs kubecon we are under the

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,299
cncf the cloud native Computing

91
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,959
Foundation but we operate with our own

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,599
editorial Independence I suppose from

93
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,299
one perspective which means that we're a

94
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,319
collection of uh a raggedy collection of

95
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,739
voluntary individuals as you can see

96
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,079
enthusiasts is probably the strongest

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,380
defining commonality

98
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,180
many of us are lucky enough to do

99
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,979
security for a living we also welcome

100
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,620
people from an educative or academic

101
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,500
background as well as researchers

102
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,199
hobbyists there is no minimum bar to

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
entry we're thankful for anybody who

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,080
chooses to spend their time with us

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,940
goals really this concept of

106
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,100
strengthening the ecosystem tax

107
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,740
Securities mandate is under the

108
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,479
technical oversight Committee of the

109
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,600
cncf to ensure the products and projects

110
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
that are looking for that stamp of

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,740
approval looking for access to the

112
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,840
marketing budget looking for the

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,000
reflected associative Glory that comes

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,979
with being in the same Foundation as

115
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,780
kubernetes one of the fastest growing

116
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,280
projects in the history of Open Source

117
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,460
plus the Cavalcade of other projects we

118
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,199
have with us

119
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,960
are appropriately hardened that we don't

120
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,300
miss the foot guns that we don't ship

121
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,639
things that do not have that minimum

122
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,360
standard of technical security quality

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,100
we identify gaps this is part of our

124
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,419
threat modeling process that we will

125
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,300
talk about education is really important

126
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,360
thank you for arranging and running the

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,860
CTF today James

128
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,139
part of the points of running those sort

129
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,020
of things is enshrining the adversarial

130
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,900
mindset in defense of security

131
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,780
it's only really possible from a Sun Tzu

132
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,479
perspective to know your enemy and

133
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
defend against them with a full

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,720
understanding of The Suite of

135
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,060
capabilities an attacker or adversary

136
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,800
may have

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,479
I hope that we're the kindest

138
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,400
approachable Security Group in the

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,800
history of security uh you be the judge

140
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,259
we do meet regularly and have very open

141
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,979
discourse there is no nerd sniping going

142
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,199
on here

143
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,120
fostering maturity this is part of our

144
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,460
mandate to help grow the projects in the

145
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,880
cncf engaging more communities we do

146
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,100
this intrinsically by virtue of those

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,620
organizations coming to us as part of

148
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,500
that Toc mandate and stepping up through

149
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,600
the levels advancing hopefully to

150
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
graduate

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,080
we're there as part of that path and we

152
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,720
look to collaborate and work in tandem

153
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,240
with the project themselves

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,580
finally nurturing growth and

155
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,400
participation it is a high pollutant

156
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,360
goal

157
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,180
we really want as much contribution we

158
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,759
are the product of or we are the sum of

159
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
our parts really we are the product of

160
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
the contributions that people make to us

161
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
and we're nothing without the community

162
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,100
that builds and supports us so thank you

163
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,680
to everybody who has contributed and

164
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,319
please do throw your hat in the ring if

165
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,600
you would like to understand different

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,940
security mindsets and different ways of

167
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,220
approaching problems there really is no

168
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,880
finer community in my humble opinion

169
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,460
our Charter protection of cloud native

170
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,100
systems this is our goal the Advent of

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,740
all this new technology brings a rush of

172
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,620
developers as we saw at the Advent of

173
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,259
the cloud native Renaissance

174
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,940
the people who are delivering code were

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,440
writing golang

176
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,419
golang is relatively exclusive in terms

177
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,759
of language penetration in 2013 there

178
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,039
were not many security Engineers writing

179
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,580
that language and so we see incredible

180
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,199
utility afforded to developers and

181
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,380
operators with some attenuation of

182
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,020
security Focus because again of the

183
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,060
complexity of penetration of dealing

184
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,440
with a language with concurrency

185
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,680
Primitives I suppose

186
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,360
what about rust we ask ourselves the

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,060
Russ Foundation is uh is interested

188
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,400
we're yet to see a lot of rust turning

189
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,259
up in the cncf perhaps you can correct

190
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,340
me but uh yes as it advances we will

191
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,080
also be looking for Rush security

192
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,060
practitioners because that is certainly

193
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,740
somewhere that we do not currently have

194
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,599
strong representation

195
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,639
it is exactly the same problem the long

196
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
tail of

197
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
uh the short entrance

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,060
to uh

199
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,020
The Humble brag from Mr cattle's that we

200
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,699
have two implementations of the update

201
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,800
framework one of the First Security

202
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,500
projects to come through tag security

203
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,879
with uh published security properties

204
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,020
and a known attack and defense surface

205
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,599
but yes please anybody interested in

206
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,059
helping the ecosystem we are raising the

207
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,539
bar of security universally

208
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,420
we have next helping developers meet

209
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,519
security requirements these are the

210
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,320
abstracts sometimes security

211
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,540
requirements that developers find hard

212
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,360
to reconcile with genuine

213
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,580
implementations this is where we can

214
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,019
provide value we've been through this

215
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,720
process multiple times and we look to

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,180
minimize the friction involved with

217
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,380
implementing

218
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,240
again these abstract security properties

219
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,700
and common tooling for audit and

220
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,980
reasoning about system properties

221
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,100
we have provided some organizations and

222
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,019
a reference to spiffy Spire threat

223
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,080
modeling work here especially with very

224
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,620
detailed security properties that can be

225
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,779
given to adopters so the systems that

226
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,720
they build upon these security tools

227
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,459
and we're in a space where we know that

228
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,920
rolling our own security tools is the

229
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,019
method of Last Resorts that write your

230
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,300
own cryptography do the minimum you can

231
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,220
try and Implement other things but when

232
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,660
there is a gap in the market where there

233
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,880
is innovation when there is the bleeding

234
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
edge instead of allowing adopters to be

235
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,459
cut on that bleeding edge we provide

236
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,680
them with for example in this case

237
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,279
a matrix of compromise an attack Matrix

238
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,839
what happens when an attacker has this

239
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,000
level of access to your system these are

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,260
the security properties that still

241
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,120
remain these are those that you should

242
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,459
mitigate with other controls I advise

243
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,019
you if you're interested to look through

244
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,399
that work as an entry point to

245
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,540
understanding

246
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,339
the capabilities of some of the people

247
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,420
that I'm lucky enough to work with

248
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,220
with that

249
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,120
thanks to my co-chair Brandon Lum who is

250
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,019
here today aradna who also spends a huge

251
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,180
amount of time working in the team

252
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,060
we're lucky to have an active and vocal

253
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,160
Tech lead Community we welcome Mr Justin

254
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
kappels back after Hiatus very pleased

255
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,600
to have you with us again we have Andres

256
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,880
here push cars in the room I hope

257
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,320
somewhere or at least was and is around

258
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,339
and uh we we have uh of course uh then

259
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,899
Michael Liebman who is also our

260
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,779
interface into the open ssf and into the

261
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,459
salsa steering committee and then I'm

262
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,959
lucky to be joined on stage by Marina

263
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,720
and Ragga who have joined us recently uh

264
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
we also have uh Matthew who perhaps

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,880
isn't here but is working actively

266
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,519
on a complex threat model dealing with

267
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,120
Argo CD this is how modern git OBS based

268
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,459
deployments occur we also have as we'll

269
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,620
see coming up work with flux and githubs

270
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,839
in general cert manager

271
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,300
um again huge thanks to the team and I

272
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,579
will pass over to Marina all right thank

273
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,839
you

274
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,220
um so I'll talk a little bit next about

275
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,100
a couple of the projects that the tag is

276
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,140
currently involved in

277
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,600
so here's a quick

278
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,160
highlight us some new projects some

279
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,260
things that just finished so there's the

280
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,940
cloud native security white paper we

281
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,560
have a version two of that white paper

282
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,019
that was recently released as well as an

283
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,760
audio version of the white paper that's

284
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,800
available online for folks who prefer to

285
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,980
consume it in the audio format another

286
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,660
white paper that was recently released

287
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,579
was the supply chain security white

288
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,920
paper so that's also available these

289
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,180
slides will be available when they have

290
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,680
links to all of these projects they're

291
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,180
also available on GitHub and the other

292
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,680
breaking project is this Cloud native

293
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,140
security controls catalog which is a

294
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,019
catalog and GitHub where you can access

295
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,640
all of the controls and

296
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,279
and go through those some other upcoming

297
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,540
projects these are some ink progress

298
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,980
projects this is a great place to get

299
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,560
involved if any of these have your

300
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,180
interests and have open issues on GitHub

301
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,800
to track all of the different progress

302
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
this includes the lightweight threat

303
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,180
model threat modeling project the

304
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,860
version 3 of the cloud native security

305
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,200
white paper because security is always

306
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,700
evolving and so we need to keep making

307
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
versions of this white paper until we

308
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,680
capture everything in perfectly which

309
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
will never happen and then we have the

310
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,060
cloud native security controls mappings

311
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,320
there's a couple different versions of

312
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,060
that mapping the cloud native security

313
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,279
controls to existing standardization

314
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,779
efforts

315
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,940
and we have some security assessments so

316
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,920
lots of ongoing ones here I think what a

317
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,959
couple just completed some some link

318
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,480
there that are ongoing or upcoming

319
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,940
and the zero trust white paper is also

320
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,740
an in progress project another white

321
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,540
paper explaining Focus this time on the

322
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,240
zero trust architecture for cloud native

323
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,100
and

324
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,920
um the V2 of the audio for this Cloud

325
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,680
native security white paper that covers

326
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,540
the V2 version of the white paper

327
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,420
instead of the V1

328
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,860
so that's kind of what we have ongoing

329
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,079
and again links to GitHub if anything

330
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,519
catches your attention with lots more

331
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,040
detail about all these projects so I

332
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,200
encourage everybody to get involved and

333
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,820
join us in whichever version of this

334
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,380
whichever project seems the most

335
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,720
interesting to you

336
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,639
and I'm going to pass it on to Raga to

337
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,380
talk a bit about where you can jump in

338
