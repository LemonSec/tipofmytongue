1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
yeah well good afternoon yeah well and

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,919
the people that is online too

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,780
uh very happy to be here it's my first

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,559
time doing a long trip because I am from

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,440
Peru but I live in Brazil it's like

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,140
uh 14 hours far away and well I will

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,400
talk about my experience that I have

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,500
research a little about how is the

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,698
finest attacking Linux

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,120
hear about myself

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,399
I really like Community because we learn

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,379
and

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,120
also I participate in in the kubernetes

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,879
documentations helping in the uh

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,300
helping in the translation in Portuguese

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,260
and Spanish mainly in Spanish and

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,280
currently in this release I am

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,300
working in this in the release docs or

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,040
of 126. if everyone is interested you

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,939
can also pick me and also I really like

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,100
Cloud native and security

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,520
and tropical weathers yeah I think it's

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,820
a overview about myself

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,299
and we will talk uh about violence

25
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,820
because when you try to search this in

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,740
Google you will find a lot of info

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,880
informations

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,820
and next we will give a brief

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,579
introduction about ebps

30
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,780
and how can we use these tools to detect

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,720
this kind of attackers

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,439
a specific detection that I will use in

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,298
my demo that will be about files

34
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,340
um yeah well the definition about file

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,460
is as you can see is some malicious code

36
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,560
will try to run

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,439
the to execute it

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,160
in our system but without using the file

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,979
system is the main definitions about the

40
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,580
file system that's keep in mind

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,760
and also it's very it's known as a

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,180
non-malware or zero food footprint

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,680
because of this

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,099
because they it's uh difficult to detect

45
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,920
because traditional security tours use

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,980
file system to detect this kind of

47
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,860
attacks or issues

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,000
and when you see it's something like you

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
also will hear about leaving of the land

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,440
so Impressions and also you can

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
the file is when you try to search you

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,940
will see that they have a lot of

53
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,459
material or a lot of attacks that's

54
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,980
happening in Windows traditionally more

55
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,379
in Windows will have several attacks

56
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,720
that it's already happened

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,440
and they use legitimate programs like

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,700
Powershell

59
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,959
to introduce like uh like we can see in

60
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,659
this image and it's it's it seems that

61
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,319
is the normal process but the threat

62
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,400
after it's using this to introduce some

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,640
uh some pillow ads that could damage or

64
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,220
could insert malicious code

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,519
um when also when we see about file list

66
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,680
we will read that this Advanced

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,220
persistence threat apt and is this

68
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,220
because generally when you are hearing

69
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,760
about files is because it's on against

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,860
big companies or between nations you see

71
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,200
that the hackers put a lot of

72
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,180
a lot of

73
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,299
Force who allowed the

74
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,239
uh yeah they put a lot of effort

75
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,920
sometimes the words in the English words

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,120
is missing but well put a lot of effort

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,459
to to attack

78
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,159
and yeah this is a famous a famous case

79
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,579
that is the cobal kitty

80
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,660
that they attack and this payload to

81
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,060
this violence attack it's like one year

82
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,479
that it's happening inside of the system

83
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
before the security team or anyone

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
detect this

85
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,560
attack on they use like Powershell or

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,380
a legitimate programs like in this case

87
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,139
it was Cobalt strike but this is more

88
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,340
the literature that we will hear about

89
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,680
violence attack in Windows

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,160
but now I will tell how can happen these

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,320
file is attack in Linux because right

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,960
now our kubernet containers and

93
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,539
everything is running in Linux

94
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,380
and mainly

95
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,880
uh when we

96
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,840
talk about files in Linux it's using the

97
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,199
LD preload or p-trace

98
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,020
or these many FD crates is called that

99
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,440
it will be the focus of My Demo but this

100
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,580
is the

101
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,400
the common artifacts that it could

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,979
happen far less in Linux

103
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:34,020
so as you can see first we song thread

104
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,500
actor Will

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,139
will try to use these legitims programs

106
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,919
in Linux to try to load some malicious

107
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,719
code and execute it basically

108
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,820
what's up

109
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,680
the attacks is already happening like

110
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,800
you can see this research and also it

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
was like some

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
inspiration because sometimes we read

113
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,460
about some security research that say

114
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,320
how is happening fireless and I want to

115
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,560
simplify a little how how is doing this

116
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,759
only to demonstrate running a container

117
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,400
how can we use mainfd

118
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,320
from

119
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,620
when you see attacks in the wild is that

120
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,199
it's already creating some malicious

121
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
code that is trying to use this

122
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,819
technique in the containers so

123
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:35,400
some part this

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,300
file is introduced on malware and as you

125
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,039
can see uh

126
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,400
our static scanning tools don't help us

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,900
to detect this kind of attack

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,120
because

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,120
when we run this is a legitimate program

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,740
it's not a vulnerability that we could

131
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,560
see it or or our scanning static

132
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,259
scanning tools help us to detect this is

133
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,759
a files

134
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,419
vulnerability for example it's not the

135
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:10,500
concept

136
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,979
and there's a reason that we can find

137
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,840
this this kind of of attacks using

138
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,479
these specific tools

139
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,360
so uh to following uh this is a

140
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,840
song of the attacks that I will is about

141
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,619
Linux is

142
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,919
a code that is using main FD grade now

143
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,860
already it was detected by several

144
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,440
security research teams that this on the

145
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,919
in the wild that is the expression

146
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,380
and this is the main code I send you I

147
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,280
have the all the reference in the slides

148
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,800
but basically there are using

149
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,099
encryptations so it's not only using the

150
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,860
the system called that like I will use

151
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,580
it it's also using encryptation to help

152
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,800
us to help with the obfuscation

153
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,740
and here is the main code about

154
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,660
run from memory

155
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,099
that is the main part that will be

156
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,919
called the called mainfd creates is

157
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,660
called

158
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,300
try to

159
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,240
write this malicious code in this new

160
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,839
file descriptor and execute it so I will

161
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,060
use this this is the main part

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,500
some

163
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,360
uh these men if they create is

164
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,720
the most easily way to create files it

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,480
could be created in other ways but it is

166
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,940
more simple you only have to call this

167
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,160
is called and they will create a file

168
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,279
descriptor and you have many codes in

169
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,140
the internet that is already using this

170
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,920
so this is

171
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,080
only just keep in mind that that's the

172
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
reason that I am using many FD grade

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,540
when you

174
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,779
um next I a brief introduction about

175
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,700
ebpf

176
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,220
to see how can help us to detect this

177
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,940
kind

178
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,140
of

179
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,439
of attack or this malicious

180
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,440
and here uh it's an overview how can we

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,740
uh ebpf we have because when we talk

182
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,380
about ebpf we will talk a lot of user

183
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,100
exp user space and kernel space

184
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,360
we have our system calls and we have the

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,500
programs

186
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,279
the evpf programs that is lowered it in

187
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,820
the kernel

188
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,180
uh some maybe I I put some

189
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,540
uh some other things like the Linux

190
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,180
security for me is a little Linux

191
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,680
security mode models that also it's you

192
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,320
hear a lot about Linux security models

193
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,820
because is before the BPF

194
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,279
we write some code in the kernel using

195
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,779
this

196
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,839
but right now we are using more ebpf

197
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,600
because it's like a more technical a

198
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,320
modern technology that give us benefits

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,380
and here we have like programs like

200
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,899
Falco Trace Etc on that I will use it to

201
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,700
try to detect

202
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,360
the main FD create

203
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,959
okay

204
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,480
and as you can see when we talk about

205
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,420
ebpf we will talk about kernel events

206
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,660
it's a lot of events that is inside of

207
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,820
our kernel

208
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,760
and we have like kernel functions

209
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
systems calls but it's not

210
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
only the system's Corner because we have

211
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,880
Trace points and I

212
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,440
put in this information because when you

213
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,839
see the rules that I will use it is

214
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,680
related maybe at Trace point or some

215
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,800
Cape groups it depends how you're

216
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,019
designed your ebpf program

217
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,000
so um

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,920
the trace point

219
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,140
here is an overview

220
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,200
the how can you use these

221
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,420
instrumentations

222
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,760
basically is a static instrumentations

223
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,620
points today

224
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,620
you can instrument several things inside

225
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,660
of the these ebpf programs when

226
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,079
the the events happen if we attach the

227
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,019
cppf progresses when it's starting to

228
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,360
filter this information

229
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,620
and also we have the cape groups

230
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,220
and well I was reading about these Trace

231
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,160
points okay groups

232
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
um when you

233
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
when you have both you you can try to

234
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,820
use it more Trace point because it's

235
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,940
more stable but in some uses cases you

236
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,100
only have k-proops on events that is

237
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,380
only supported by K person it will

238
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,680
depends that the design of the type of

239
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,779
event that you want to filter

240
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,640
this is well before I was only talking

241
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,920
about these Cape proofs and Trace points

242
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,959
because in the rules you will see these

243
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,720
words don't just keep in mind

244
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,330
and right now I will

245
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,560
[Music]

246
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,180
talk about

247
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,560
how I developed the the demo and I will

248
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,420
run using

249
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,639
Falco Tracy and tetragon this is

250
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,880
here we have these three tools that they

251
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,700
use ebpf

252
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,019
um my my demos it's based in the default

253
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,839
installation of these tools because

254
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,959
they both support

255
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,360
Linux machines and kubernetes and I

256
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,000
install it in the default version in

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,079
kubernetes clusters

258
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,880
from

259
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,000
My Demo is trying to detect this

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,540
suspicious malicious code that is these

261
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,660
three main steps remain lines that this

262
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,839
I am calling they may have to create

263
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,620
and next I am

264
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,180
writing in this new file descriptor this

265
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,040
is that is in memory

266
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,820
I am writing some malicious code in this

267
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,160
fight descriptor that is already memory

268
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,839
and next I try to

269
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,579
execute this malicious code but it's in

270
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,760
the file descriptor and we are spawning

271
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,120
this in the display name that you put

272
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,880
some for example a running process that

273
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,000
that in my case will be nginx and in

274
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,339
this way is expounded

275
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,700
using with this exact and

276
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,519
is prominent with the malicious code and

277
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,720
also

278
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,139
the file descriptor if you can see the

279
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,760
path is

280
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,720
the process file system

281
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,940
this is the main code that it was before

282
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,480
the explanation of Zuri code that it was

283
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,540
how was implemented in this specific way

284
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,820
you can Implement in several other ways

285
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,899
but this is following that it was in the

286
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,240
wild attack about this this is really

287
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,040
that I put in the before so slide

288
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,279
um this is the code I just put it some

289
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,540
more uh more print lines and also all

290
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,079
the code is in my repository that they

291
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,720
have the code and also they have

292
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,899
uh a little explanation about each

293
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,079
runtime at the demo and the steps

294
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,040
um next I built this code and I inserted

295
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,459
in a container I built the image and I

296
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,459
insert this binary to use it inside in a

297
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,860
container and that's all that's the

298
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,320
reason that when you see in the demos

299
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,880
this demo main FD is because I I build

300
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,060
this code and I put it inside of my

301
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,639
container

302
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,540
so uh next I I will start with Falco

303
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,459
this is

304
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,139
the main

305
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,019
architecture that you can find in the

306
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,019
documentation of the the project

307
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,019
and yeah the rules now is in the the

308
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,040
user space uh they have predefined rules

309
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,540
macros

310
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,019
this part of the rule engine that you

311
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,079
can see is

312
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,459
uh here is the rule now that I wrote

313
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,940
by default uh it's uh don't detect

314
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,000
exactly the main FD creates so you can

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,459
customize with some other

316
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,519
rules if that's the case

317
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,860
you you can edit in the kubernetes mode

318
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,199
you edit a config map that is the this

319
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,420
is the print about the config map that I

320
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,100
did and I tried to filter by

321
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,060
uh basically they spawn it exact CBE and

322
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,440
exact beat

323
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,920
that is two ways that you can execute

324
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,440
the system scores

325
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,519
um yeah and I try to also filter by the

326
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,459
path the process

327
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,920
and this is

328
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,300
uh

329
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,059
the recording

330
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,520
I hope yeah

331
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,059
I am running the main FD

332
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,220
with the

333
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,020
only using elf is not a malicious scope

334
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,699
this is only a health

335
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,459
that is printing the date but it could

336
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,160
be replaced with any malicious code so

337
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,860
you can run it without problem in your

338
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,700
house

339
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,080
it's like only to to try to

340
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,559
trigger this main FD create and simulate

341
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,900
the process of

342
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,799
of a file is execution

343
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,799
and

344
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,039
I could fix this this rule because I was

345
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,559
trying to talk with the

346
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,620
with some friends of Falco and I think I

347
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,080
have some output that I call improve I

348
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,120
will try to improve and I will do up the

349
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,200
updates in my repository but I I think

350
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,980
uh that's that this is detected you can

351
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,480
see that this detective execution I have

352
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,460
uh some

353
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,799
others run C execution that is it's

354
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,780
appearing

355
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,539
right now the main FD create is the

356
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,120
Cisco itself is not supported that's the

357
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,039
reason that I am not not using in this

358
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,059
rule

359
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,840
uh

360
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,600
um and next I will show hearing tetragon

361
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,179
we have also uh as you can see here the

362
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,960
collectors is they have the collector in

363
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,100
the kernel space that it means that you

364
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,740
have to you have to write your

365
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,340
your rules or your filters that they can

366
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,360
map they can apply these filters to show

367
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,220
to show you uh that the the events that

368
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,600
you are looking

369
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,220
uh for example in the before June

370
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,860
you don't have some signatures by

371
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,440
default but you have to create in this

372
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
collector

373
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,280
thus I think it will be more clear about

374
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,919
this collector uh

375
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,679
seeing the

376
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,520
the tracing policy yeah is the name is a

377
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,919
custom resource definition and in this

378
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,840
case because I am trying to look at the

379
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,580
main SD create that is the main point

380
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,660
the system is called I am

381
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,120
Define it in the role right that if some

382
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,840
CIS called magnifi create

383
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,900
and also another city is called the CIS

384
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,760
close

385
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,440
and I think the the main point of this

386
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
rule because they have this feature that

387
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,860
is the

388
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,539
find kill that you after I find my

389
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,960
main if they create yeah no it is here

390
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,000
is in the execution CB because they have

391
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,380
the main FD

392
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,840
and execution itself this is malicious

393
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,179
content when he noticed that they have

394
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,520
this or this much of magnifi and

395
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,039
execution cbes

396
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,440
I will

397
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,900
kill the process when it's matching the

398
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,600
proxel file descriptor that is

399
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,640
uh execution of my program no matter

400
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,900
uh if I if I will um Fred actor I can

401
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,200
see this this Rule and I could create

402
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
another

403
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,220
folder to to

404
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,700
apply my malicious code like proxel file

405
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,480
and I could bypass this rule

406
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
that's the reason that also I see I know

407
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,720
that they are doing a pull request with

408
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,320
uh better approach that it's using I

409
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,520
notes

410
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,340
also using my notes because it's in is

411
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,320
for merges

412
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,100
but I think the most

413
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,620
complex when you are trying to create

414
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,380
your rules is about the security

415
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,260
research knowledge

416
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,820
I don't know if I I share my my

417
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,919
experience sir but I am work as a

418
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
developer and next like as a cloud

419
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,140
architect The Bobs

420
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,299
and go into security and it's different

421
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:34,380
when you are a security research that

422
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,720
because you are dedicated to create

423
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,260
these kinds of information that it's uh

424
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,000
yeah you will see that it's very

425
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,580
difficult when you try to search or dig

426
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,380
information about the attacks in

427
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,440
specific cases because it's always a way

428
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,520
to

429
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,120
bypass this rule or another methods to

430
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,480
to the threat actor try to create some

431
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,880
malicious code

432
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,179
so here is the action that you can see

433
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,740
that is killing the process

434
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,740
and next I will

435
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,559
talk about Tracy

436
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,679
in the case of Tracy the rule it was

437
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,780
already there so I didn't have to create

438
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,320
it because uh security research already

439
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,740
put the the rule there but I will

440
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,960
explain a little about the rule

441
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,240
uh

442
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,960
this uh this architecture about how eppf

443
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,140
in Tracy works as you can see also we

444
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,200
have the ABP evpf collector

445
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,900
but its filter

446
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,520
by

447
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,400
the events of the

448
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,480
of the sinators that is pre-lot because

449
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,059
when you run also in the next slide you

450
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,220
will see that the queen is running Tracy

451
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,280
in the mode ebpf

452
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,400
evpf Trace they generate a lot of events

453
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
but in this case there are a filter by

454
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,159
only the events that is necessary for

455
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
the signatures the sinators is already

456
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,159
the all the rules preload

457
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,559
that will detect some kind of security

458
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,900
issues

459
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,780
don't design a tools that will be like

460
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,460
the rules the filters that already

461
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,840
created in

462
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,360
Falco tetron that is trying to detect

463
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,980
some malicious

464
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,380
actions uh

465
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,620
you can see some default signatures are

466
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,720
created there and also you have to

467
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,140
reference

468
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,320
um I only doing this demo with song of

469
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,760
the rule that is the phallus

470
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,400
and here this is the rule that it's it's

471
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,380
already there either I didn't write it

472
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,600
it's

473
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,140
and the main is also trying to look in

474
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,080
these cases using Trace point to try to

475
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,559
catch this ebpf the kernel events using

476
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,080
Trace point with evpf

477
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,440
and the first two rules it's trying to

478
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,380
find the main FD

479
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,100
and the others is also other parts that

480
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,620
is also related with

481
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,240
temporary

482
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,020
folders and that it's other way that you

483
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,460
can create files

484
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,799
and here is the demo with

485
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,740
with Tracy so

486
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,220
here is the default output when you are

487
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,659
running as a tool of the detections that

488
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,640
it's detected some malicious code and

489
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,600
that's printed

490
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,580
and here it's

491
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,260
[Music]

492
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,059
um

493
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,559
this is the mode that is running in mode

494
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,280
that ebpf Trace that they

495
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,679
you can use without filters and they are

496
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,500
they you will see all the bands that is

497
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,440
producing or you can

498
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,240
put some several filters that it's

499
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,640
that is relevant for you so in this case

500
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,000
I only put like

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,340
uh how how can you capture a binary that

502
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,860
is a common thing that the forensic

503
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,260
thing it's interesting that it's someone

504
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,200
trying to execute some something and you

505
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,360
can capture this and try to analyze

506
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,500
after

507
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,700
after this is in the mode of the ebpf

508
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,779
trace

509
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,659
and well yeah

510
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,080
if you can see it a complete attack

511
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,419
I only explained a little that will be

512
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,240
running in memory and even is without

513
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,580
encryptations now because when the

514
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,720
attack itself happened they use on a

515
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,299
packer interpretation only to create the

516
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,000
part of obfuscation level it would be

517
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,799
more difficult to detect

518
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,460
and as you can see when I really attacks

519
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,860
happen in the wild they are have a more

520
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,740
complex and that's

521
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,360
something that you can be awareness that

522
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,220
that's the reason that

523
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,740
only yeah it's the end because in the

524
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,720
other part we have run in memory and you

525
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,360
have more root kids

526
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,779
that is the security is very difficult

527
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,200
and I think my sharing in

528
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,659
about this experience about searching

529
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,440
about violence is

530
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,260
yeah it's really hard the security in in

531
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,419
the when you're trying to create some

532
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,880
rules or trying to apply it how can I

533
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,880
detect files and I will try to put the

534
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,460
rule because when you read uh in this

535
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,860
case I only use main fdcreate but you

536
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,740
can bypass with using other things and

537
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,840
when you are reading you see that in

538
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,020
some other blogs for example they they

539
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,200
could using another way is like yeah

540
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,000
it's down on the Revit hall because you

541
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,320
are thinking that with this rule you are

542
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,559
catching that event but itself

543
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,260
when it's happening or when you see in

544
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,140
the blocks of the security people that

545
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,900
is is searching it's uh yeah it's it's

546
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,179
always another way you you can bypass

547
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,419
and I only I think I want to give a

548
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,460
thank you for the three projects because

549
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
these projects are

550
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,080
sharing their knowledge and security

551
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,380
because you can see and I see I put in

552
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,480
the reference but they already have some

553
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,120
security default rules that you can try

554
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,820
to catch and learn how they are doing

555
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,740
and I think this is

556
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,740
important

557
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,740
yeah here are my contacts and if you

558
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,860
have any doubt or you also want to

559
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,159
have some notes how can

560
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,100
improve the rules or everything uh yeah

561
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,520
I am available and yeah thank you to all

562
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,700
the projects that they help me when I go

563
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,340
to the slack of every project yeah I

564
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,299
think

565
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,000
it will be that's all

566
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,600
thanks
