1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,540
all right good morning uh I'm going to

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,799
be doing a fair amount of reading from

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,620
my notes uh but just as I said on my

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,120
wedding day it's not that I mean the

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,700
words any less I just didn't memorize

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,200
them

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,820
um my name is Cara I'm a senior

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,279
engineering manager from VMware and 10

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,640
years ago I was a UI engineer at a

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
startup called Dynamic Ops and then

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
VMware bought us and our product became

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,260
V realize automation which is now Aria

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,960
automation a SAS version of our

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,000
infrastructure management tool

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,440
we created a world-class user experience

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,579
for creating Cloud templates for the

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,680
provisioning and management of VMS

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,079
back then we were solving for VMS what

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,059
we're now solving for containers

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,460
and in the cloud native space I see

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,260
similar challenges in presenting

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,300
multi-faceted Concepts and I'm

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,000
passionate about building API first

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,199
accessible guise that help us understand

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,160
them

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
there are few spaces more difficult

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,039
than the security space

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,840
and I'd like to take a look at the pain

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,060
points of cves that you your colleagues

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,280
your customers no doubt are living with

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,600
and what we can do to alleviate them

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
with a GUI

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,720
so right now platform operators are

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,700
struggling to triage thousands and

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,900
depending on the size of your company

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,240
and the sprawl of the software you're

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,460
building and securing tens of thousands

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,060
of instances of cves they see a wall of

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,880
critical cves in front of them

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,920
and as far as they're concerned the

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,100
house is on fire and they're not wrong

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,680
the risks are incalculable

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
got exfiltration brand tarnishing

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,140
customer data compromise the list goes

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,540
on you wouldn't be at securitycon if it

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,040
were worth talking about the things that

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
keep you up at night

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,659
what can we do to build an agui that

49
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,100
will help you sleep

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,479
I want to take you through a couple of

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
levels of guise to address the needs

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,979
at some companies

53
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,780
after a platform operator identifies

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,060
those cves they want dealt with they

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,220
send them to developers to analyze the

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,139
risk so this might look familiar to a

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,220
bunch of you

58
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,680
the developers run the analysis

59
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,000
determined that they're at low risk for

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,640
a given cve

61
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,099
but then the security analysts update

62
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,020
the cve from perhaps pi to critical risk

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,300
and platform operators throw it back to

64
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,040
developers and have them do another

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
analysis of a cve that they've already

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,879
done

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
in addition security folks are under

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,680
pressure to generate reports on their

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
compliance with slas escalating risk and

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
they're playing catch-up that's pressure

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,180
that pressure is sometimes passed along

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,700
to the devs as well and the tension is

73
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,620
palpable

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,540
can only have their cortisol levels

75
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,239
escalated for so long before they just

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,819
stop caring

77
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,760
so what's the risk of cve fatigue

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,959
right now you're looking through

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,420
horizontally scaled logs exponentially

80
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,519
increasing trying to find patterns in

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,959
the noise

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,599
your risk is increasing maximizing the

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,560
chance that you're going to miss

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,900
something critical

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,360
a GUI can help prioritize work

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
so that critical cves don't get dropped

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
alert when things go sideways highlight

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,280
hot spots this would be your dashboard

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,540
GUI

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,900
so something that's read-only give me

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,580
the highlights show me something that I

92
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,480
can take to my manager

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,580
now a GUI for cves and s-bombs is going

94
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,900
to run into the same problem instead of

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,500
CLI seim tool because fundamentally it's

96
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,239
a problem of scale

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,239
the problem is so big so deep so tall

98
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,799
while machines do some things

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
particularly well humans have a

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,159
different set of skills that are

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,540
essential when it comes to assessing

102
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,220
these vulnerabilities

103
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,140
we're good at communication

104
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,620
empathy and deciding what's relevant

105
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,760
and they're going to be some judgment

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,900
calls that you and your teams are going

107
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,060
to have to make we need the empathy to

108
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,000
understand the developer experience

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,799
and to respond to their exhaustion with

110
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,720
representation of the right data at the

111
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,980
right level

112
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,239
the vulnerability could be in your

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,560
binaries but that binary is sitting

114
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,599
inside a highly secure environment so

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,918
it's not going to matter or put your

116
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,680
business at any risk

117
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,779
uh whoops

118
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,440
apologies

119
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,320
oh for goodness sakes

120
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,080
I can't get over my notes

121
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,840
uh let's see

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
uh or there's a critical vulnerability

123
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,919
in an upstream package and it's overdue

124
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,139
there's no fix Upstream you can Fork it

125
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,759
and fix it but what's the cost of the

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,139
business to mitigate

127
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,940
a GUI that allows us to weigh the

128
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,560
potential harm and the risk to the

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
business would let me annotate the cves

130
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,660
oh I'm really sorry

131
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,880
but let me annotate the cves

132
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,199
and so this is where I need a

133
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,800
a Right View that right view would allow

134
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,020
me to do things like

135
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
um

136
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,080
uh do the shades of risk and I believe

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,820
it was John Holland yesterday and his

138
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,860
talk from City where he talked about

139
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,100
being able to weigh the pros and cons

140
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,020
and put in that human factor that we

141
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,020
couldn't do that not just having a yes

142
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,299
and no but those areas of Gray

143
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,240
so once you've done the analysis you've

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
identified the risk you've surfaced the

145
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
change status to the cve you might even

146
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
have a workable plan for how to deploy

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,039
it to production raise your hand if

148
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,419
you've ever found your fix in the middle

149
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,220
of the night and then at 8 am the next

150
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,720
day you've needed to explain it to

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,639
someone to that Moment of clarity

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,740
disappear

153
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,039
anybody lost their Moment of clarity

154
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,479
how are you going to share this critical

155
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,280
information with your non-security

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,500
immersed colleagues they're the ones who

157
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
have to decide if they need to pull the

158
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,960
alarm

159
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,400
we need something that helps you tell

160
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,199
the story that GUI becomes the central

161
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,699
location to collaborate

162
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,259
so that communication but that that

163
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,240
place where cross-functional teams can

164
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,220
come together it's one of the reasons we

165
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,800
incorporated backstage into our platform

166
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,979
uh it's it was built to enable a unified

167
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,000
interface

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,740
this should be the space where I began

169
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,240
to build out a picture of The Logical

170
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,639
architecture and what tiers are impacted

171
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,860
by a given vulnerability it's where I'll

172
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,020
show the service that's at risk and its

173
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,000
lead times change so that when I make

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,580
that change I know the sort of impact

175
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,139
I'll be imposing on the timeline

176
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,600
and for whatever reason

177
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,039
I can't get to the rest of my notes

178
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,039
that's really unfortunate

179
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,880
something about the presentation mode is

180
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,659
making it really difficult

181
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm not sure what's happening there

182
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,479
all right so uh in any case I will just

183
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,520
use them from here

184
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,259
so ideally I want that GUI to play

185
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,440
nicely with other guis and with

186
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,000
well-developed seamless handoffs between

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,520
their apis this will not be the one rule

188
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,740
to ring them all so the rule one ring to

189
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,000
rule them all but it should be both

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,979
extensible and interoperable with other

191
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,500
tools solving adjacent problems so I can

192
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,300
put them in my common sphere of

193
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,680
understanding

194
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,479
if you haven't yet considered a GUI tool

195
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,120
now is the time there are over 2 million

196
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,300
npm modules npm packages and a million

197
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,620
go modules

198
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,080
and half a million Maven artifacts we as

199
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,280
a community should be building tools

200
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,960
that don't require you to be exclusively

201
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
in the terminal

202
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,560
building that mental model

203
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,199
and then having been having to be the

204
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,940
ones that carry the burden of explaining

205
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,879
it to act on vulnerabilities reliably we

206
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,199
need to ensure that we surface them with

207
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,139
empathy in a way that is accessible and

208
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,620
actionable

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,690
thank you very much

210
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,740
[Applause]
