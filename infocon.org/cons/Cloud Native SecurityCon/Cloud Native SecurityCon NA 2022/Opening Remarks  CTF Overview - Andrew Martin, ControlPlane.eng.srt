00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,300
tomorrow we have the edition of a

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,520
capture the flag experience those of you

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,799
who have been here before may remember

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,040
uh dread pirate Captain hash Jack and

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
his nefarious goings-on

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,540
we also have a selection of workshops

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,880
they will be happening outside of this

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,100
room and we will continue with our

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,619
content in here

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,260
we have drinks receptions both tonight

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,500
and tomorrow they are on level two of

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,480
this building

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,579
and

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,520
with the greatest pleasure and again the

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,380
warmest and brightest of thanks to

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,880
everybody who has helped to make it

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,879
happen but we have a standalone security

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,300
con happening in February

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,020
this is all the same spicy Cloud native

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,059
security goodness that you have come to

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,399
know and love from tax security and from

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,699
these colos but independently

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,500
standing by itself

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,920
same content different location and we

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,059
will uh

26
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,159
look to learn from

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,400
this event and hopefully continue add

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,180
infant item

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,340
there are a couple of pre-recorded

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,500
sessions today oh there's one today and

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,580
three tomorrow

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,439
you can identify

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,240
from the schedule

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,700
they'll play in the room and speakers

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,280
will hopefully hop onto slack so that we

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,500
can get some feedback and Real Time

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,340
Communication and questions

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,520
and as if it wasn't clear enough to us

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
all already

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,140
supply chain and open source security

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,740
be so hot right now

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,860
over 90 percent of packages equaled from

43
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,740
open source package libraries have a fix

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,619
available we are installing old broken

45
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,579
software and that has a ripple effect

46
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,439
repercussions for all parts of our

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,560
structure our build systems our end user

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,600
devices

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
keep those tariff statistics in mind as

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,300
we progress through our content for the

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,860
next couple

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,959
there are plenty of Open Source

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,580
opportunity to remediate these things

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,060
and importantly as an open source and

55
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,400
voluntary

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,540
participation-based community

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,819
there are plenty of places for you and

58
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,860
your organizations to get involved not

59
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,860
only in tax Securities work but also in

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,760
the projects that we help to assure and

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,560
also more broadly of course over the

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
course of this week everything under the

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,280
cncf's bright shining Banner

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,819
talking of banners we have a CTF a

65
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,440
practical Banner

66
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,160
the way that this will be played is all

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,540
through a terminal

68
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,019
we kick it off tomorrow in the room

69
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,500
across the way room 333 but for those of

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,900
us who have not played a CTF before

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,540
we'll run through a workshop today so

72
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,140
instead of this being a deaf style

73
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,080
malware reversing binary exploitation

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,980
kind of CTF we are looking to help

75
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,540
people understand kubernetes security

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,200
contacts sorry Concepts and contexts of

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,920
course

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,159
so this is an educative ETF there is

79
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,780
still a competitive element

80
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,319
but it's not designed to uh mangle the

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,019
Swede as we might say in the UK or

82
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,599
similarly twist the brain

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,340
learn how to

84
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,220
poem clusters and pot shells

85
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,920
we'll do an introductory Workshop today

86
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
and this will guide you through one of

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,760
the previous CTF

88
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,299
scenarios that we've run before

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,420
points of doing style of CTF is to help

90
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,299
internalize the adversarial mindset and

91
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,680
then give us an opportunity to

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,140
understand where to apply controls

93
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,659
ultimately helping to raise the barrier

94
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,920
Cloud native security

95
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,220
there is also a companion website

96
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,200
as I say we'll start with a workshop

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,780
today and then three workshops will run

98
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,879
throughout tomorrow running through

99
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,060
three increasingly complex scenarios you

100
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,620
are advised to turn up for the first

101
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,620
session if you are not feeling overly

102
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,540
confident if you pop in just for the

103
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,400
third session it will be slightly more

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,758
difficult

105
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,800
and of course we have the cloud native

106
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,040
goose chasing us throughouts

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,460
this is the website and of course the

108
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,759
protocol Captain hashtags black flagged

109
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,180
vessel

110
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,100
as I say everything is run through the

111
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,540
command line

112
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,979
and

113
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,620
you can prepare for the CTF there I hope

114
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,000
that has

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
suitably

116
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,380
ensnared some of your interests okay

117
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,960
what do we have coming up this morning

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,500
we have Keynotes and into our first talk

119
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,440
we have Michael Foster from red hat with

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,199
crossing the kubernetes network policy

121
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,699
Castle

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,800
then Jeremy Colvin from upticks why

123
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,100
develop a laptop security is key to

124
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,740
securing your cfp pipeline

125
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,199
again those open source statistics

126
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,160
coming into shop

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,059

coffee break

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,180
of the next two days

130
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,060
a huge thanks to our sport who have

131
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,639
helped to make everything possible

132
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,380
uh cystic upticks and VMware tanzu some

133
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,120
long-standing supporters of the security

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,460
community in there

135
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,000
are some sponsor apparel

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,240
and gold tigera and veritas much

137
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,699
appreciated thank you for the supports

138
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,800
and that slide has spectacularly failed

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
to load big thanks to everybody whose

140
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,180
faces are supposed to be here

141
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,940
who helped on the program committee who

142
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,639
have helped again volunteering their

143
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,940
spare time in order to schedule and

144
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,100
manage an event like this it is a

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,039
non-trivial process so huge thanks they

146
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,660
will also appear on the closing slides

147
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,000
so they have a second opportunity

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,020
um

149
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,060
also a huge thank you to everybody

150
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,180
involved in tag security again these are

151
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,039
voluntary efforts with people's Spare

152
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,020
Time organizations putting funding

153
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,280
behind the open source security

154
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,639
thank you once more to the incredible

155
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,960
effort we've seen

156
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,900
from these individuals

157
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,440
and of course it would be remiss there's

158
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,580
another

159
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,639
uh another missing image

160
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,520
you remiss not to remind you that should

161
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,380
you have the spare Cycles the

162
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,560
inclination or just the interest to join

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,440
what tax security does we meet every

164
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,300
week

165
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,699
we have an emir time zone meeting we

166
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,360
have a U.S flavored time zone meeting

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,940
they alternated

168
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,479
good things like Shoring projects cntf

169
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,660
are looking to help graduate we're

170
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,900
working now with cert manager flux Argo

171
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,979
CD these are again critical projects to

172
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,500
the sanctity and safety of production

173
