00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,659
the CTF either you can visit the room or

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,799
you can post it on the cncf slack in the

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,020
tax security Channel

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,500
yesterday was a wonderful day we covered

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,840
a lot of interesting topics right from

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,900
security best practices to remote access

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,579
architecture

39
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,799
doing vulnerability management finding

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,020
various volunteers and then finally

41
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,820
supply chain

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,100
we cannot have enough of supply chain so

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,899
I'll promise that we'll also have some

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,040
supply chain Security today as well

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,219
the CTF is continuing today so please uh

46
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,920
do take some time to go through it there

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,700
are six amazing levels in the CTF

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,940
in terms of the talks we have a variety

49
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,640
of talks right from compliance and

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,860
governance

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,340
cicd devsecops some interesting attacks

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,739
on the kubernetes infrastructure and

53
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,660
then more importantly our workshops as

54
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,099
well

55
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,160
a quick note about the logistics

56
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,140
yesterday all the sessions were in this

57
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,180
room 330 a b today we have an update the

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,340
workshops and some of the talks will be

59
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,340
in this room 330 a b and some of the

60
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,700
talks will be in room 321

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,220
um yesterday I came back from the lunch

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,120
break and um I came back to the room and

63
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,920
I was just prepping to do the next

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,800
speaker introduction and I see an

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
unfamiliar face like the person did not

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,239
match with what's on my schedule

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,980
and um

68
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,500
I think the person's name was Jimmy

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,739
um so I told Jimmy hey buddy I don't see

70
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,040
you on the schedule and uh Jimmy is like

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,739
are you no the only reason my company

72
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,560
sponsored is because I'm giving a talk

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,120
and I was like are you sure you're

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,620
giving a talk today

75
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,900
and it took me like maybe 30 seconds to

76
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,480
realize that I was in the wrong room

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,840
um it's a long story short go to the

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,760
right room so please make a note that we

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,540
have two rooms today

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,379
her quick highlights of the slides of

81
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,900
the work done by the tax security

82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,799
we have a bunch of wonderful white

83
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,860
papers and recommendations in terms of

84
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,720
reference architectures we have the

85
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,000
cloud native security white paper which

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
is available as markdown PDF as well as

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,340
in the audio versions

88
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,680
we have a lot of work on supply chain

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,659
security so we have serverless security

90
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,599
as well as the secure software Factory

91
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,099
paper

92
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,099
and then I think as an industry you

93
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,019
really need to agree upon what

94
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,659
terminology we are using so we have the

95
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,279
cloud native security lexicon

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
and then in terms of working groups

97
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,460
there are a bunch of working groups I

98
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,380
just named a couple here there are the

99
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,479
supply chain security and the policy

100
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,820
working group and then hand a few

101
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,919
Hands-On initiatives such as the

102
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,100
controls catalog security paths security

103
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,600
map and many more

104
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,060
cncf tax security is a volunteer driven

105
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,720
approach all of us communic collaborate

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,820
and contribute to this Foundation

107
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,000
and here's a quick look at the people

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,699

109
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,340

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,699
or just note any of the communication

123
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,020
channels here right from slack Twitter

124
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,620
mailing lists GitHub

125
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,560
Zoom or the cncf tax security Channel on

126
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
YouTube

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,979
if you go on GitHub you'll see a bunch

128
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,620
of good first issues to work upon if you

129
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,240
are looking to join the tax Security

130
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,660
Group

131
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,840
and with that a thank you note to our

132
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,520

as well as our Platinum sponsors apparel

135
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,259
without the support of the sponsors this

136
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,660
event would not be possible

137
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,060
I think that's it from my side I hope

138
