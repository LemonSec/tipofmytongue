00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,279
know i did

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,720
unfortunately i didn't get a chance to

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,960

either through the slack channels or

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,920

for sig security so we're gonna

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,079
talk a little bit more about security

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,440
and how you can get involved with this

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,719
awesome group of people

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
as well as do a full day event recap and

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
q a in case you're curious about

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,520
anything else going on with sig security

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
or if you've got questions about

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
anything associated with cloud native

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,719
security we've got some great stuff

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,920
coming up for you

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,800

i'm just going to go through a couple of

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,360
slides so i'm going to tell you a little

38
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,560
bit more about

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
security um on top of what emily has

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
already shared this morning

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
and then we're going to go into the

42
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,680
discussions

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
so awesome what do we have for sec

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,720
security

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,680
um so emily covered in the morning a

46
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,200
little bit about presentations and

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,640
discussions

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,040
uh this is something that's ongoing as

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,159
you can see some of the

50
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,720
the topics here uh of our stuff that

51
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,600
we've seen today

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
for example parsec there's some

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
there's a lot of topics that we have

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
coming from

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,720
um the other working groups that we work

56
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,240
with for example

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
the um policy working group

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
we work closely with other this big data

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
working group and so on

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
and as emily mentioned you know whenever

61
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,200
there's

62
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
a chance for community collaboration uh

63
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
for example ava dropped by

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
from the confidential competing

65
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,200
consortium and then we talked about you

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
know the ways we could engage

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
as a cognitive community um so if you're

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
in um a community that would like to be

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
uh involved with cloud native security

70
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,040
on there

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
is you are you have a project that you

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,319
think

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,520
um would be interesting to share about

74
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
um to come create an issue uh everything

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,760
that we have

76
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,200
is managerial github

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
so another big thing that we have is the

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
supply chain catalog

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
this was something that was created a

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,000
while back by

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
by santiago and a couple others

82
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,760
and there was a lot of interest in the

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,599
supply chain

84
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,560
problems in security today we even had a

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,080
breakout

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,400
hallway track session on that and i

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,519
think there were a lot of

88
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,040
interesting things that were put in

89
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
there i think there was even a paper it

90
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,720
was called

91
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
the backstabbers knives collection or

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
something also paper is definitely

93
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
something to read

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,440
uh it's a cool title so um this catalog

95
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
is commonly maintained so um

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,959
i think based on the the number of

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,319
resources that were posted in the

98
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,120
channel

99
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
uh if you see that there's something

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,239
they're missing that's missing for the

101
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:22,800
catalog

102
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
or we can make improvements to it please

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,200
don't hesitate to

104
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,560
create a pr against it

105
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
all right so um usually we have

106
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,159
ampersand meetups

107
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,720
so um this is something that hopefully

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,319
next year we'll start resuming

109
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
once um things get back to normal

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
um so hopefully um

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,040
i know europe will be virtual but maybe

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,799
the next q con and they

113
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
will see each other again

114
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,640
and um we also have security assessments

115
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,239
this was is one of the car activities

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
that we engaged in

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,200
today we have um five security

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
assessments

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
already done um these security

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
assessments are way to really assess the

121
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
security posture of a cncf project

122
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
there's a lot of interaction to the tlc

123
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,199
and helping them

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
provide recommendations on what is

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
a project's security posture as

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,320
well as as a secure if it's security

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,759
project for example

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
how does it really fit into the cncf

129
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
ecosystem and

130
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,880
the the output of this project is a

131
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
security document

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
which um you know we for these projects

133
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
that we've already done

134
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
um it is a document where if you're

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
interested in the project

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
or you have been looking at one of these

137
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
projects for example oprah

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
and you're not sure like where do you

139
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,040
where do i start in terms of security

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,479
considerations

141
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,120
um the security assessment document is

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
something that you should definitely

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
take a look at

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
it really is like a good introductory

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
document

146
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
security assessments are also a good

147
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
way to engage in the community uh

148
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
usually assessments

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,520
are scoped about two about four weeks

150
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,080
total

151
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
uh where two weeks of it is the main

152
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
review and assessment and the rest

153
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
is kind of putting together everything

154
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,919
at the end

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,960
and then looking up

156
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
a summary of what the recommendations

157
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
are

158
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
so it's very nicely scoped usually we

159
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,199
have 405 reviews

160
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,600
assessment and so this is open to

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
to everyone if you're someone that is

162
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,280
new to this

163
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,479
or would like to learn

164
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,199
we have opportunities to kind of shadow

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,639
to kind of

166
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,479
join the channel to see what's happening

167
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,319
with the security assessments

168
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,840
and if you're someone that's experienced

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
with this um

170
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
definitely come take a look and it'll be

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,440
great to have more people on board

172
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,639
so just a shout out to all the security

173
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
reviewers we've had since

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
we started security assessments uh thank

175
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,440
you so much we wouldn't have been able

176
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
to do

177
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,000
the the first vice assessments which was

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,560
our

179
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,639
first security assessment milestone

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,520
so how do i get involved with sec

181
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,400
security

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,319
um six security is um mainly

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
based on our github repository so if you

184
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,240
go there

185
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
um there's meeting information stack

186
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,520
information

187
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
uh everything is governed in the github

188
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,199
repository

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
and so

190
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,199
there is a new members page that you can

191
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
take a look at uh tells you a little bit

192
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
more about

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,479
security what we do as well as how to

194
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,319
add yourself as a member to

195
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,199
the group we have weekly meetings that

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,479
you can join in our

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,919
zoom session every wednesday

198
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,639
if not what happens usually in the repo

199
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:12,960
is

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
everything is well documented in issues

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,479
of pull requests so if you actually go

202
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,280
to a

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,560
the github repo and you go into issues

204
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,039
uh if you've seen anything in the

205
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,479
previous slides that you're interested

206
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,440
in for example

207
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
you wanna present something about your

208
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,599
project to the group

209
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,720
or talk about you know the security

210
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
uh practices within your organization

211
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,840
you can

212
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
uh you can create an issue for

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,360
presentation and then

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,039
you know we'll start out the logistics

215
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
to do that you present that

216
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,560
or if you have a security idea that

217
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,440
you would like to you think could the

218
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
guru could benefit from you could add a

219
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
proposal or a suggestion

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,639
and if you're a project that would like

221
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:00,960
to

222
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
start a security assessment process you

223
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
can go ahead and create a security

224
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,520
assessment

225
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
issue

226
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,280
so with that i'm gonna wrap up this this

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
part of the closing

228
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,599
um like i mentioned multiple times

229
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,560
before

230
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,240
everything is on the github so if if

231
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
um if you remember one thing um just go

232
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,800
to the github

233
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
um cncf security

234
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
uh our meeting times are on wednesday

235
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
and we have a sac

236
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,919
link over here of which is part of the

237
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,640
cncf site

238
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
and don't forget to sign up for our

239
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
mailing list

240
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
all right so emily back to you

241
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,000
that was awesome thank you so much

242
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
brandon um

243
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
jj what was one of your favorite talks

244
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
for today i know i have a list

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
and i know brandon's got at least one if

246
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,440
not too

247
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
um but jj how about you what was your

248
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,839
favorite talk

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
oh jj i can't hear you

250
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,640
sorry i'll first go to lantern before i

251
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
actually

252
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,160
go for it i'll i'll have to digest my

253
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
yeah i i think i think for me um

254
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,279
i think i had i had a couple of favorite

255
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,160
talks um

256
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,800
i really like the you know the dynamic

257
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,519
analysis

258
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
during the ashtrays system calls you're

259
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,440
talking about

260
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,880
ebpf and how it's kind of really evolved

261
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,080
how people do analysis and dynamic

262
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,399
um even just like the runtime security

263
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,440
stuff

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,800
um i'm also like a big fan of any

265
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
hardware security um related things so

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
here the past like presentations and

267
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,480
also even

268
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,079
uh even the certificates um i think

269
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,680
we're talking about how we actually

270
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
bootstrap the chain of trust to hsm i

271
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
think i thought that was cool

272
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
yeah definitely those ones were all

273
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
really good ones

274
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,760
um i i think so i

275
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
it's hard for me to like just pick one

276
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,760
but i i have to admit

277
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
the ubc talk at the end of the day right

278
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,079
before the ctf wrap up

279
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
i thought was really cool because it

280
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
highlighted

281
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
a huge problem space that occurs in the

282
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,040
community when we're

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
trying to go cloud native because cloud

284
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
native landscape is so large

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,920
and security is like three miles long

286
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,720
and like

287
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,760
leagues deep but the

288
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
the nice little shopping list that they

289
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
put together for how to get

290
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,160
um some of these tool tools to work

291
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,040
together

292
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
and we we heard about that earlier in

293
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
some of the other talks that you can't

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,519
just like

295
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,399
pick one solution and just roll with it

296
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
and you're automatically secure

297
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,920
you have to work on them a little bit

298
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
you have to build that defense and depth

299
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
mentality across your organization this

300
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,800
is not just going to be

301
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,440
runtime security that's a concern it's

302
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
going to be

303
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,320
all along your supply chain it's going

304
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,600
to be through your build it's going to

305
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
be through your pipeline

306
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:28,320
all of that jj what about you

307
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,440
i mean the eppf stock was like the most

308
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,399
fascinating one

309
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,200
uh i'd love to uh

310
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
there's so much so much about the abpf

311
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
that's actually a mystery

312
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,519
for most people in terms of is it secure

313
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
is it not secure is it kernel board is

314
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,440
it not kernel mode

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,770
and

316
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,880
[Music]

317
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
and i mean as an industry i think

318
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,519
there's a lot of clarification

319
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,880
it's super powerful as a tool to be used

320
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,760
and super relevant for the modern day

321
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,120
compute and a modern day

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,839
networking overall and especially modern

323
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,959
day observability

324
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,839
that actually provides much more

325
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,760
security at scale

326
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
so i hope uh

327
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,399
i hope there is more of those kinds of

328
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,920
discussions and talks that

329
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,440
uh that happen to ease and comfort

330
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,279
users there is also like a lot of doubts

331
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,120
in terms of the versions of

332
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
kernel where it's applicable too so

333
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,399
there is there is tremendous amount of

334
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,240
repetition in terms of like adopting

335
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
ebpf and i think more of those stocks

336
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
will actually help these

337
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,800
and i think it is much more relevant for

338
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,079
security at scale

339
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,920
for a lot of things so that was my

340
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,760
most favorite talk

341
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,880
yeah and i think i think also um

342
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,839
jj talked about you know the modern

343
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,560
modern cloud

344
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,120
deployments and also emily talked about

345
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
you know just having to juggle

346
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
uh different aspects of security but

347
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,639
then

348
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
you know even like in the the chat

349
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,639
governance

350
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,040
um lightning talk where we talked about

351
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
you know it's not even just

352
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,639
different components of your security

353
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,480
ecosystem but

354
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,800
when you have multiple parties involved

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
like your cloud provider

356
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,079
um you know how do you make sure that

357
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,519
you have proper governance

358
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,040
of that you know what um

359
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
as a as a

360
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,160
company or as a cloud user

361
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
how do i ensure that even my

362
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
implementation security

363
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,959
meets up to the standards how do i do

364
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,120
compliance and or disability

365
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,040
if i don't own certain services

366
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
yeah policy distribution at

367
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,199
scale computed with

368
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,160
performance is it's going to be a

369
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,199
challenge and the more the computes are

370
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,440
not under your control the more faster

371
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,720
you want to

372
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
like evaluate the security policies

373
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,839
and it needs to happen closer to the

374
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,160
edge

375
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,279
so it's going to be a that is something

376
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,079
that actually

377
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,240
was it's still fascinating and i think

378
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,800
it should

379
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
we should pay attention to that i

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
suppose i mean overall all the talks

381
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
were

382
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,079
phenomenal and fantastic especially some

383
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,440
that actually overlaid the industry

384
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,839
was also good but this one was

385
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,839
probably my favorite talk

386
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
so uh we actually got our first question

387
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,920
uh one of our sig security members

388
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,199
decided to ask it

389
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,399
so um bushkara wants to know what are

390
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,480
our recommendations for security related

391
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
talks to attend for the rest of kubecon

392
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
and i can only assume that he's asking

393
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
that because

394
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,199
he's so in love with all the security

395
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
talks that we had today at cloud native

396
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
security day

397
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
and he can't quite get enough of it as

398
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
we've seen in some of the other slack

399
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,560
channels talking about security day so

400
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,519
brandon what

401
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
what talk are you looking forward to or

402
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,720
would you recommend

403
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
in the kubecon schedule i'll be honest i

404
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,600
was going to look through this tonight

405
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
i actually haven't had the time to

406
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,959
lecture doctor does this

407
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,199
um i'm magic i'm looking through it

408
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,680
right now

409
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,000
um

410
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,639
all right jj how about you yeah give me

411
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,120
a second

412
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
yeah i haven't uh i'm in the same camp

413
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
as uh

414
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,839
brandon um

415
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
i think yeah i'm just looking

416
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,519
through it quickly i think there are a

417
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,279
few few things

418
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,320
that could be interesting um

419
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,399
anything which is kind of like bypassing

420
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,560
security mechanisms i think you know

421
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,120
the one that um that the google team did

422
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,040
a couple coupons back on like um

423
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,800
jumping between notes that one was cool

424
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
so there's a there's another one

425
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,920
called um bypass falco so i think this

426
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
could be cool you know it's going to

427
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
touch on

428
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,600
um a lot of the the the stuff that we

429
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
just talked about like ebpf

430
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
you know it's it's a mystery it's um

431
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,360
it's something cool but

432
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,959
i think this would be kind of a good

433
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,079
insight and a nice exercise to kind of

434
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,480
see

435
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
how um how the trap model of that fits

436
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,920
into

437
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,279
into applications as well

438
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
yeah for me like i spent most of

439
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,839
yesterday

440
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
furiously combing through the schedule

441
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,399
looking at all of the talks

442
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,439
the bypassing falco one definitely stood

443
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,640
out for sure

444
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
uh there were a couple of other ones

445
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,079
though that i thought were really

446
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,079
interesting uh let me find that one

447
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,599
uh there's i mean pretty much any talk

448
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,480
with liz

449
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,799
and it liz rice is going to be good uh

450
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
man there's just so many and that's what

451
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,319
one of the nice things is

452
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
that we're starting to see more security

453
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,360
focused talks with um

454
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
or even just regular technical talks

455
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
with the security bend to them which is

456
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,720
fabulous and that's something that we

457
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
want to see from the community

458
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
but yeah i actually have my schedule

459
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,039
viewable so if you are

460
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,000
friends with me in sketch you can check

461
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
out and see

462
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,520
which sessions i'm going to if you're

463
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
interested

464
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
uh look yeah i think i think to stop the

465
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
starbucks one

466
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
stop about something that i looked at

467
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,640
for for a bit

468
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
it's definitely a cool observability as

469
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880
well as kind of get a good idea of what

470
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,679
you know things within your cluster

471
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,400
what's happening there

472
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
i also i'm looking forward to

473
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
the pki pki the wrong way

474
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,080
um because that is something that aldo

475
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
has been around

476
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,360
um is misunderstood a lot and i think

477
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,160
this is gonna be um

478
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,280
you know help solidify some of

479
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,320
the kind of mindsets and also hopefully

480
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,679
give me another way to

481
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
to see it and to see how

482
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,080
how we can you know make sure we cover

483
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,919
those grounds when we're in the

484
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,400
bki i feel like no matter how many times

485
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,039
you do it

486
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
you get bound to make mistakes

487
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,559
yeah we got another question um for

488
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
compliance automation do we have any

489
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,360
recommendations for a specific session

490
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
um i i would like to point out that we

491
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,039
had some excellent compliance

492
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,760
check coverage today with oppa i think

493
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,640
there was at least

494
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,360
three talks discussed today that

495
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
mentioned opa

496
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,600
or talked about policy enforcement

497
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,720
and automation of policy roles

498
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,080
so jj do you know of a particular talk

499
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
or maybe even specific technology that

500
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
we can point books to

501
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,520
to learn more in that space

502
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
um i mean oppas uh hope

503
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,440
is a pretty good

504
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
pretty good first step and i think there

505
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,960
is also

506
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,919
a bunch around

507
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
that's published closer to cloud

508
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,919
security alliance that actually is

509
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,080
somewhat of the intersection point of

510
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,039
where we are

511
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,960
if you're looking purely for compliance

512
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
i think there are a bunch of

513
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
standard space stuff that that are

514
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,840
available

515
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
that it's probably worth looking at

516
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,720
but we do a lot of cross-pollination

517
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
between like a bunch of other

518
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
security consortiums to ours and i think

519
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
if you were to

520
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
listen to some of the security

521
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,360
talks like in the last previous four to

522
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,880
five blocks i think a bunch of times

523
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
compliance

524
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
has come up in the conversation and

525
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
there were like few good recommendations

526
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
there too but in general

527
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
uh there's good amount of resources in

528
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,080
cloud security alliances that i'll point

529
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,480
to

530
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,559
uh overall and then attending

531
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,600
six security meeting for more of uh

532
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,679
more of in-depth conversation would be

533
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,640
an useful thing

534
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,919
and compliance is like one of those

535
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,720
things where like when your

536
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
infrastructure is moving dynamically

537
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
anything that's been defined yesterday

538
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,159
doesn't actually apply today

539
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,200
uh and it's uh

540
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,559
it's uh it's good to have

541
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,000
a scriptable compliance story to go with

542
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,240
uh but what you want to know is like

543
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,760
what uh

544
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,000
how do you verify validate and then how

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
do you basically assert

546
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
what you have sets what's happening uh

547
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,039
in the system

548
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,120
uh when the infrastructure itself is

549
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,880
changing when

550
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
computes are not the thing that you

551
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,000
actually own

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
this uh it's a to a large extent it's an

553
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,640
open problem so

554
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,559
participating in community is probably

555
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,679
what i would say

556
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,039
to keep uh ahead of what your compliance

557
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,190
story should look like

558
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,320
[Music]

559
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
yeah i think uh there are like two

560
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
two or more over talks um in the

561
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
security track

562
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,320
um but but while we're on this

563
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
i think a couple other sessions that our

564
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,159
topics

565
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,039
you know outside kubecon um you know

566
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,840
oscar

567
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,280
is one of them um

568
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,960
and also just um my personal

569
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
way to kind of like look into the

570
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,039
compliance one of the things that i like

571
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:57,520
doing

572
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,039
is a lot of these um

573
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,960
you know products have kind of like this

574
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,400
compliance mapping

575
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
where they'll kind of say okay here's um

576
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,360
here's a new standard here's

577
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,159
where the specific controls we'll map

578
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,840
onto it

579
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,080
we did some work as part of the sick

580
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,200
with the

581
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,000
um the dod there was a spreadsheet

582
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,360
somewhere

583
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,600
i i think we can make it in the the

584
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
slack channel later

585
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
but that kind of talked about what some

586
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,000
of the controls that you know kubernetes

587
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
or you know some kind of scanning tools

588
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
are going to be

589
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,679
um but i think yeah compliance is

590
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,200
something that's

591
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
very specific to implementation as well

592
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,280
as very specific to

593
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,320
the type of compliance that that you

594
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,880
want to

595
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,280
end up doing whether it's you know um

596
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,000
fisma

597
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,480
or or fedramp or hipaa but you should

598
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
buy something this so so if you can map

599
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:56,799
it

600
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,919
on some some type of in this 853 you

601
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,080
should be fine

602
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,520
yeah you actually brought up a good

603
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,039
point and this is something that we back

604
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,000
we've talked about

605
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,840
quite a bit in the sig is that security

606
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
and compliance are often lumped together

607
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
and they don't always mean the same

608
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,919
thing

609
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,960
you can be more secure in some cases

610
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
through implementing compliance controls

611
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,440
but you're not always going to be

612
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
compliant when you're just implementing

613
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
security out of the gate

614
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
so it's important to note that

615
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,039
compliance rule sets and policy rule

616
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
sets can help make your organization

617
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,400
more secure when you're doing them

618
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,120
correctly

619
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
but one does not always necessarily mean

620
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
the other

621
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
and we we've talked about this in a

622
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
couple of previous meetings within the

623
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,799
sig

624
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,200
and it's actually going to be discussed

625
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
briefly and the cloud native security

626
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
weight paper which is going to go

627
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
live tomorrow so shout out to cncf the

628
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
awesome folks there that have helped us

629
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
work through the logistics about getting

630
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,559
that document published

631
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,480
and it will become live in our repo

632
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
after kubecon cloudnativecon

633
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,840
is complete

634
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,200
that you

635
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
the white paper also has a lot of a lot

636
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,720
of pointers too

637
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,240
it doesn't have a full story on

638
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,159
compliance but it has different amount

639
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,520
of indications to what

640
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
think through in terms of compliance so

641
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,919
i'd highly recommend

642
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,880
uh taking a look at uh look at that as

643
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,960
well

644
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,320
yeah i think also um the policy what

645
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,880
group

646
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
that is friendly and csv um

647
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,799
has some discussions i i looked at a

648
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,000
couple recordings

649
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
for some of the sessions and they're

650
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
talking about compliance and in terms of

651
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,080
the policy framework as well so that

652
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,200
could be a good place to

653
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
to go through as well

654
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,200
definitely for sure um

655
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
what else did you guys like the most

656
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
about security day

657
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
overall mostly because i've been so

658
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,039
close to the cloud native security white

659
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,559
paper and getting that wrapped up

660
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,960
it was really nice to see that almost

661
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,039
every single one of the talks

662
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,520
were entirely about cloud native

663
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
security end to end

664
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,080
or at least how you manage or deal with

665
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
a particular problem area

666
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,400
in cloud native security it's i talked

667
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
specifically about

668
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,320
dynamic image security scanning and how

669
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,480
that fits into your life cycle which we

670
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
talk about in the paper as well

671
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
um alfie and nick talking about the

672
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
importance of your data source and the

673
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
benefits of understanding

674
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
what the data gives you for cloud native

675
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,799
security kelly talked about security

676
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,880
theater which i think a lot of us

677
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
are very familiar with and the list just

678
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,080
goes on and on

679
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,200
a lot of these topics are huge problems

680
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,600
in the

681
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
area where we're trying to move security

682
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
forward and there was a lot of that kind

683
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
of like progression

684
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,559
um in many of the talks what did what

685
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,400
did you all think about

686
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
the what was the most important theme or

687
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,440
what were the biggest takeaways from

688
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
today

689
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,520
for me actually i i feel like um

690
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,320
the the cool thing was that we kind of

691
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
see

692
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,400
the talks evolving to

693
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,279
be targeted towards a more mutual

694
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,640
security posture

695
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
of running compute you know it's no

696
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
longer

697
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,880
um oh i'm just going to put some

698
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,559
scanning stuff

699
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,440
and then i have the ci and have my

700
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
cluster and our bank and i find right

701
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,080
we're going to be

702
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,360
seeing a lot of more advanced

703
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
problems right that's why we have um

704
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
cartographer

705
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
um you know we're looking at service

706
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,720
mesh we look at you know how do i

707
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,760
having service mesh site cars and and

708
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,559
authorization

709
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,240
kafka right how do i bring it all

710
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,400
together in a place that makes sense

711
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,559
uh we're not just talking about simple

712
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,159
basic controls but you know how do we

713
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,440
tie the entire security

714
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,400
picture together so i think that that's

715
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,880
what

716
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
i i got excited about especially about

717
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,039
the hardware stuff

718
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,080
um but i you know i'm curious to hear

719
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,200
from everyone as well you know what uh

720
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,919
kind of future topics that we can really

721
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,640
go into

722
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,399
what's interesting what are the new

723
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,320
requirements that we're seeing

724
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
uh as we are getting more and more

725
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,799
workloads moving to accommodative

726
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,960
yeah i mean one of the talk related to

727
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,840
that

728
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,679
that reminded me of is the uh

729
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,080
defenders thinking list attackers think

730
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,720
and grab

731
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,760
that one was a yeah

732
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,200
yeah there are like multiple people that

733
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,919
talked about that as well uh

734
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,039
before this isn't the first time but

735
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,039
uh it's just fascinating for

736
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,360
as as the services get more distributed

737
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,320
as the services are running everywhere

738
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,200
the difference mechanism of early days

739
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
of like just making it

740
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
perimeter-based security doesn't

741
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,640
actually really work

742
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,840
now we have to look through

743
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,360
the defense mechanism in a completely

744
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
different way to

745
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,720
think through it that i would highly

746
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,159
recommend like any talk any

747
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,590
directionally

748
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,360
[Music]

749
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
applications either compliance

750
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
verifications or even application of

751
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,880
authorization policies that thinks about

752
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
it in a graph based way

753
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,039
it's probably a directionally right

754
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,159
thing to do

755
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,120
might be too early to be honest i think

756
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,480
it's still

757
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,159
still a lot to be decided in terms of

758
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,000
performance when you're evaluating in

759
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,080
that zone but

760
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,760
directionally i think that's probably a

761
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,120
good

762
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,199
good way to think through security

763
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,840
yeah i think uh one of the interesting

764
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
things that we got

765
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,679
a lot of is you're just because you're

766
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,640
doing containers

767
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,480
doesn't necessarily mean you're secure

768
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,440
um and we saw that through this etf and

769
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,559
it's unfortunate that

770
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,600
andrew handed trump offline uh but

771
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
if you were online before he did a

772
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
wrap-up of the ctf

773
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,840
and he went through all of the all the

774
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,279
challenges and the flags

775
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,279
and this was our first time doing this

776
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,279
etf as part of cloud native security day

777
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,360
we wanted to do one of these for a while

778
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,080
and it's really awesome to see so many

779
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
people especially first

780
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
and security or folks just sipping their

781
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
toes into the water

782
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,960
to be so successful in their first

783
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,039
container escape

784
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,559
did either of you have a chance to

785
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,159
participate in the ccf i know i didn't

786
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,399
i didn't no i didn't get to

787
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
unfortunately maybe next year when

788
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,120
when we can take a break from running

789
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,559
the event well next week

790
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,720
we should we should uh get andrew to

791
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,039
give us all the access

792
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,960
that's right but exactly right

793
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
but yeah the container security is super

794
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
important but container security isn't

795
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,480
the only thing that's going

796
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,120
on in the cloud native space we had a

797
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,960
presentation at one of the cigs recently

798
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,799
about serverless security from the cloud

799
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,240
native security alliance

800
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,480
and as of late i mean i've been getting

801
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
a lot of newsletters from various

802
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,520
sources about things that are going on

803
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,720
in the security landscape

804
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,880
and serverless security has pretty much

805
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
come up in the last 10

806
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,279
emails about it that i've gotten so i'm

807
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,640
i'm curious do you guys think we're

808
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,919
going to get some serverless security

809
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,880
talks next year maybe

810
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,600
that could be cool yeah yeah it is

811
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,279
it is a fascinating topic so what

812
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,520
security because it is the ephemerality

813
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,080
of

814
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,520
makes it uh harder to

815
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,039
enforce a security that's actually

816
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,640
consistent so

817
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
yeah i think it's harder but at the same

818
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,720
time it's easier because

819
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,880
the good thing is really it's it's

820
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
decompose your entire

821
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,360
application your entire enterprise into

822
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,200
the smallest component so you could

823
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
technically

824
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
uh theoretically have the best

825
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,840
authorization policies ever

826
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,159
which is um that level attraction

827
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,360
of compute and multi-tenancy

828
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,640
it's the difference between container

829
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,360
contained will be more secure container

830
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,559
is assumed security right so

831
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,960
that's the

832
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,880
yeah the the nice thing about that and

833
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,320
with a lot of the other talks that we

834
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
got especially from the

835
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,080
the end user stories like with ubico and

836
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,559
um

837
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,000
one of the other presentations that we

838
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,880
had earlier is that it kind of builds on

839
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
the previous layer or the previous

840
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,399
activities or the previous part of the

841
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,200
life cycle

842
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,559
to ensure that we're getting to that

843
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,480
more and more secure state as compute

844
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,039
gets more and more finite and smaller

845
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
so i'm i'm curious to see what kind of

846
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,360
talk submissions we're going to get next

847
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,000
year i'm very excited about it

848
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,840
do we have any other questions from

849
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,120
folks i know that we

850
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,880
