00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,320
good morning everyone and welcome to the

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,000
cloud native computing foundation's

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
cloud native security day

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
i'm emily fox co-chair of sig security

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,760
and we'll be kicking off this event

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
thank you for joining me in our awesome

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,040
collection of presenters

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,719
we appreciate everyone's flexibility

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,160
this year that enabled us to adjust the

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,920
way in which this event is held

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
i would like to extend a huge thank you

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,199
to cncf for allowing the special

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
interest group for security to hold this

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
event a third time

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,080
as well as working with us the security

16
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
day program committee to make the

17
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
transition to a virtual event possible

18
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
the point of today is to bring together

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,399
several diverse communities

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,040
security development and operations this

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,239
event is designed to enable

22
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,840
collaboration and sharing that pushes

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,200
the security of all cloud native

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
applications and platforms forward

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
this day is for you our community and

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,120
the cloud native tools and capabilities

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,719
you work on and use that allow

28
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,920
applications and products to be

29
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,440
available to the end user

30
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
in a well understood secure fashion

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,199
throughout today we want to encourage

32
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,559
you to share in the slack channel or

33
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
through social media and help

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
move the security of cloud native

35
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,680
forward

36
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,080
so what is sig security what are we and

37
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
what do we do

38
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,520
the cncf special interest group was

39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,560
formed from safe

40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
a small group of like-minded security

41
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
focused individuals intent on reducing

42
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
the gap between technology

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
adoption and when security is applied

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
they also sought a more common knowledge

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,720
of security

46
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
often seen as an alien language to the

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,360
development and operations communities

48
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,880
sig security is here to assist in

49
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,799
reducing data exposure of cloud-native

50
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,759
applications

51
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
as well as unauthorized access to and by

52
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
those applications

53
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,479
we focus on protecting cloud-native

54
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
systems we enable the community to

55
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,000
engage in a common language of knowledge

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,680
and tooling so developers and teams

57
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,600
comprehend the implications of security

58
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,119
and risk within their code

59
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,960
their applications their deployments and

60
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
their architectures

61
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,759
we seek common tooling for the core

62
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,600
foundations of security allowing all

63
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,040
cloud native applications to be

64
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
transparent of security events so the

65
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,399
community and its operators can take

66
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,439
more impactful

67
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,520
direct swift action before the next

68
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,960
exploit and data exposure occurs

69
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
our community is growing strong with

70
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,119
over 68 members contributing weekly to

71
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,640
our various presentations

72
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
projects and documentation not all of

73
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
our members are security experts but

74
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
each contribute to the sig through their

75
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
background skills and experiences that

76
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,440
help make the sig

77
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,959
a robust diverse and welcoming community

78
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,280
it's not just all discussions however

79
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,920
sig security does many things

80
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
during our weekly meetings we have

81
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
presentations on numerous topics

82
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
everything from upcoming cnc of sandbox

83
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,519
projects to requests for help by the

84
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
community to move security forward

85
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
in october we had a presentation from

86
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
the confidential computing consortium

87
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,239
and the cloud security alliance on

88
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,840
serverless security

89
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
as you can see we have involvement from

90
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
many different areas of open source

91
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
we also perform security assessments

92
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
that assist the community and its

93
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
projects with an initial understanding

94
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,319
of the state of their security

95
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,400
help inform the cncf technical oversight

96
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
committee of the security aspects of

97
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
cloud native projects

98
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
and provide cloud native projects with

99
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
an initial starting point for the

100
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,640
security documentation

101
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
as of october we've helped completed

102
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
five security assessments and in a true

103
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
agile fashion

104
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
reviewing what worked and didn't work in

105
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
hopes of providing an even better

106
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
process and experience for projects

107
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
as well as more concrete security impact

108
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
to those projects into the technical

109
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
oversight committee

110
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
as part of the in toto assessment we now

111
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,319
host a community-driven catalog of

112
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,920
supply chain compromises

113
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
which provide real-world examples that

114
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
help raise awareness and provide

115
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
detailed information that lets us

116
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,400
understand attack factors

117
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
and consider how to mitigate potential

118
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
risk in the supply chain

119
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,280
we are currently wrapping up a major

120
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
effort for the community called the

121
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,319
cloud native security white paper

122
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
which is written to give the audience a

123
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,680
guide to their first cloud native

124
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
security architecture

125
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
this is a huge undertaking by the

126
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,080
community and while extremely

127
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,959
comprehensive

128
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,879
we fully expect to continue iterating

129
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,200
and improving it after it's released

130
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
today's event was started last year as a

131
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,640
community driven project

132
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,560
and has grown to be an event at kubecon

133
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
and cloud native con north america

134
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
and europe as well as for the first time

135
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,560

140
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,640
what moves us forward and our community

141
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,920
driven projects are the emphasis of this

142
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,079

want to ensure our community is safe

147
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
looking forward we hope to continue our

148
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
in-person meetups as valuable avenues to

149
