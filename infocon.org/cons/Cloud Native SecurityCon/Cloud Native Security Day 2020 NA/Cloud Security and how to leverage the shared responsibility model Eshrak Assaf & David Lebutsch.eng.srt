00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
hi everyone and welcome to our talk

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,880
adopting cloud computing models could be

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,399
a blessing or a curse

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,240
when done with securing compliance in

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,320
mind it could save you lots of time

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
effort and operational costs when done

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,480
without regard to

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,239
security and compliance it could result

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,400
in exposing your company to financial

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,320
and reputational risks

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
in this lightning talk we will focus on

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
the cloud-shared responsibility model

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
and how to leverage it to your advantage

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,560
i'm a truck sf a senior development

and i'm david laboch an ibm

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,559
distinguished engineer focusing on data

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,200
and ai

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
software as a service

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
many of us are are turning into cloud

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
and want to concentrate on getting value

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
and not spending valuable resources on

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,280
supporting functions of our workloads we

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,920
outsource

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
where we could benefit though on this

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,079
journey to cloud one needs to rethink

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
roles and responsibilities for securing

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
workloads and data in a traditional

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
on-premise environment we have full

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,320
control

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
and responsibility for securing our

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,519
workloads

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,600
yet this is not the case if we move our

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,280
workloads to the cloud

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,479
cloud security roles and

37
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,560
responsibilities differ based on cloud

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
delivery model you use

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,360
whether it's is pass sas or even a

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,960
combination of them

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,119
two main stakeholders mentioned on the

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,880
european general data production

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,000
regulation

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
gdpr are controllers and processors

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
the controller is typically the customer

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,400
acting as a data controller for any

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
personal contact

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,520
content they have on their cloud

49
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
environment and determining the purpose

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
and means for processing

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,640
of personal data the processor typically

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
is the role of the cloud service

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,799
provider

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
processing personal data on behalf of

55
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,479
the controller

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,079
at it a good example is the

57
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,159
responsibility over securing privileged

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
access to cloud workloads

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,520
managing privileged access to sensitive

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,439
data is a shared responsibility between

61
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,280
the processor and the controller

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
of the data as defined by gdpr however

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,360
in the survey

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,598
shown here an alarming 60 of

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,560
organizations

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
incorrectly view the cloud provider as

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
being the solely

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
responsible for securing privileged

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
access to cloud workloads

70
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,920
if you read your agreement with your

71
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
cloud provider you'll find that this

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,440
isn't true

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
it's shocking how many public cloud

74
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
customers are assuming that the cloud

75
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,520
service providers can completely protect

76
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
their customized

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
highly individualized cloud workloads

78
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,040
during cloud migrations the majority of

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,680
the companies

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
surveyed stated that they overlooked the

81
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
shown above security controls

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
relating to privileged access to defend

83
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,200
against

84
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,440
breaches and address a portion of shared

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
responsibility models

86
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
organizations need to establish security

87
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
practices

88
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
and use security tools that are purpose

89
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
built for cloud security

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
the shared responsibility models are one

91
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,840
of the least understood but most

92
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,599
impactful components of cloud risk

93
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
management according to the cloud

94
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,000
security alliance

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
the root cause of many security

96
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
incidents is an assumption that the

97
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
cloud provider is handling something

98
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
when it turns out nobody's handling it

99
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
in his book practical cloud security

100
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,319
chris dawson explains the shared

101
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,760
responsibility model

102
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
using the analogy of eating pizza the

103
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
traditional on-premise world is like

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
making pizza at home

105
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,519
you buy lots of different components

106
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,200
make the dough assemble the pizza

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,920
yourself

108
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
it takes effort but you get complete

109
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
flexibility

110
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
when you use the infrastructure as a

111
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
service though the base layer is already

112
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
prepared for you you add whatever you

113
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,000
need to add

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
picky yourself and you're responsible

115
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
for these things

116
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,959
when you move up to platform as a

117
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,040
service more decisions are big for you

118
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
and you just use that base as part of

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,519
developing your end solution

120
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,519
with pizza as a service you're hungry

121
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,760
for pizza you can just go sit down at a

122
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,080
restaurant and order a pizza

123
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
sometimes it can be difficult to

124
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,120
categorize a service as

125
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,000
is or pass and they are growing together

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
in many cases

127
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
the exact classification isn't important

128
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,280
what's important is that you understand

129
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
what a service provider does

130
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,080
and what your responsibilities are when

131
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
you get to software as a service it

132
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,080
might

133
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
seem like everything's done for you it

134
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
is not you still have the responsibility

135
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,440
to eat safely

136
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
and although some might disagree but the

137
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
restaurant should not be responsible if

138
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
you choke on your food

139
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
in sas world this largely comes down to

140
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,000
managing access

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,040
controls properly

142
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
the reality of cloud computing is

143
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,759
unfortunately

144
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
a little more complicated than eating

145
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,639
pizza and there are some gray areas

146
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
at the bottom of the diagram things are

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,240
concrete

148
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880
often literally the cloud provider has

149
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,560
complete responsibility

150
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,960
for physical infrastructure security

151
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
which often involves controls beyond

152
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
what companies can reasonably do on

153
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
premises such as

154
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
biometric access with anti-tailgating

155
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
measures

156
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
security guards and similar controls to

157
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
keep unauthorized personnel

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
out of the physical facilities some

159
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,680
cloud providers

160
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
offer the option of running workloads on

161
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
dedicated hosts

162
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,919
for a higher cost of course if you

163
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,800
choose to run

164
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
on a multitenant virtualized environment

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
the security controls keeping your

166
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
virtual environment

167
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
separate from other customers virtual

168
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,759
environments

169
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,720
are the provider's responsibility when

170
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,039
the spectra and meltdown vulnerabilities

171
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
came to light in early 2018

172
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
one of the potential effects was that

173
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,680
the users in one virtual machine

174
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,840
could read the memory of another virtual

175
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,560
machine on the same physical computer

176
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
for is customers fixing that part of the

177
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,360
vulnerability was the responsibility of

178
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,720
the cloud provider

179
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,639
but fixing the vulnerabilities within

180
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,320
the operating system

181
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
was the customer's responsibility

182
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,160
network security is shown as a shared

183
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
responsibility

184
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
as there are several layers of

185
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,560
networking and the responsibility for

186
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,000
each lice with a

187
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
different party the cloud provider has

188
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
its own network that is

189
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
its responsibility but there is usually

190
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
a virtual network on top

191
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,479
and that's the customer's responsibility

192
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,680
to carve up

193
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
into reasonable security zones and put

194
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,800
the proper

195
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
access controls and rules around them

196
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
many implementations also use overly

197
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,479
networks firewalls

198
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,080
transport encryption that are the

199
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,479
customer's responsibility

200
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,960
operating system security is usually

201
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
your responsibility

202
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,479
if you're using is and it's the

203
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,680
customers

204
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
sorry the provider's responsibility if

205
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,360
you're purchasing

206
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
platform or software services in general

207
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
if you're purchasing those services you

208
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,199
have no access to the underlying

209
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,880
operating system

210
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
as a general rule of thumb if you have

211
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,120
the ability to break it

212
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
you usually have the responsibility for

213
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
securing it

214
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,280
middleware in this context is a generic

215
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
name for software such as databases

216
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
application servers or queuing systems

217
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
if they're in the middle between the

218
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,199
operating system and the application

219
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
they're typically not directly used by

220
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,319
end users

221
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,400
but used to develop solutions for end

222
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,599
users

223
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,759
if you're using a pass middleware

224
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,240
security is often a shared

225
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,639
responsibility

226
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,560
the provider might keep the software up

227
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
to date but you retain the

228
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
responsibility for securing

229
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,280
relevant settings such as encryption the

230
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,080
application

231
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
layer is what the end user actually uses

232
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,039
if you're using sas vulnerabilities at

233
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,080
this layer

234
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
such as cross-site scripting or sql

235
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,520
injection

236
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
are the provider's responsibility even

237
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
if all of the other layers have

238
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
bulletproof security

239
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
a vulnerability at the application

240
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
security layer

241
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,520
can easily expose all of your

242
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
information

243
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,560
finally data access security is almost

244
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
always your responsibility as a customer

245
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,000
if you incorrectly tell your cloud

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,479
provider to allow access to a specific

247
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,599
data set

248
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
such as granting incorrect storage

249
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,160
permissions middleware permissions or

250
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,479
sas permissions there's really nothing

251
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,479
the provider can do

252
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,879
many real world examples of security

253
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,960
incidents stem from poor understanding

254
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,400
of the shared responsibility model

255
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,039
and came from object storage buckets

256
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,960
even if the storage solution

257
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,000
you use is secure and encrypted it

258
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
wouldn't help if you don't set your

259
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
access controls properly

260
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
this misunderstanding has caused the

261
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
loss of data on 198 million u.s voters

262
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,120
auto tracking company records wireless

263
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640

264
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
over 3 million demographic survey

265
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,800

268
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,519
what is the water line of the iceberg of

269
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,880
your workload

270
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
we hope you found our introduction of

271
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
the shared responsibility model useful

272
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,120
as a tool to assess and classify your

273
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,720
responsibilities for your workloads

274
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
we would love to stay in touch please

275
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,399
find us on linkedin

276
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,279
and enjoy the rest of the conference
