1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
welcome to exit stage left replacing

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,319
theater with chaos

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,160
i'm kelly shortridge i'm the product

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,680
management and product strategy at

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,400
capsley

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,000
just startup based in new york city that

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,840
provides infrastructure monitoring and

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
protection for production systems

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
my spare time and maybe how you know me

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,960
already

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
i researched the intersection of

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
information security and behavioral

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,359
economics

14
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800
so what's the problem we're exploring

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
today well it's that infosec often sees

16
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,039
itself as the underappreciated star of

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,680
the i.t

18
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,840
stage often laments that it feels like

19
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,439
no one else cares about the security of

20
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,239
our data or of our systems

21
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,520
i would certainly agree and probably

22
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
some of you all do too is that infosec

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
is often a prima donna about things

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
doesn't exactly state its concerns

25
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
always calmly or constructively

26
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,200
and it's pretty boisterous in its

27
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
displeasure with developers operators

28
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
and end users

29
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
what i've seen way too many people in

30
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,199
information security consistently miss

31
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,120
is that developers and operators do

32
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,920
actually want to build secure software

33
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,120
the problem is

34
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,879
that they're judged more on the delivery

35
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,520
part rather than the security part

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,799
infosec of course in classic

37
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,560
shakespearean tradition fights its

38
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,200
stomach and

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
response and leaps onto the security

40
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
theater stage

41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
all of our detriments so what can we do

42
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
to remove the drama and the pain from

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
security theater and actually start

44
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,720
delivering safe software and systems

45
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,600
this talk will explore one way to start

46
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720
so in act one

47
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
we will welcome you to the security

48
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
theater and act two we'll explore the

49
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,159
fisticuffs between security theater

50
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,200
and security chaos engineering so

51
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,119
that act one welcome to security theater

52
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,280
to spoof the classic song welcome to the

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,119
theater to the magic to the fun

54
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,799
where snake oil tools and roadblocks

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
grow and blaming rings fortissimo

56
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159
so what do we actually mean by security

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,920
theater similar to the

58
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
origins terms and physical security

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
security theater involves any effort

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
towards producing the perception of

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
improved security

62
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,439
unfortunately creating the perception of

63
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
improved security is often at odds with

64
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,079
actually creating

65
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
meaningful and valuable security

66
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
outcomes the end result is that you

67
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
produce a whole lot of drama

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
you have historic theatrics about enough

69
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,239
for the entire audience to hear

70
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,680
security theater is also particularly

71
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
obsessed with bad apples which are

72
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
referring to humans

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
who do something malicious or

74
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
accidentally careless

75
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
and of course these humans are

76
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
incredibly rare but that doesn't change

77
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
the focus

78
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
and the problem with this is that

79
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
security theater then involves policies

80
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
that apply to everyone because you have

81
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
to be hyper vigilant for those bad

82
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,640
apples so as bogna said there might be

83
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,319
someone who can't be trusted

84
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
the strategy seems to be preventative

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
control on everybody instead of damage

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,720
control

87
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
on those few the philosophy basically

88
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,319
sucks for everyone

89
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,239
but the actors on the security theater

90
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,519
stage

91
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,280
in infosec this is why we often see the

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
department of no they say

93
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
no to all requests just in case someone

94
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
is a bad apple

95
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
and this is in part what fuels the high

96
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
conflict relationship we see often

97
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
between infosec

98
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
and engineering just humble did some

99
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,040
work

100
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,480
on risk management theater and noted

101
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,319
that any sort of theater is a common

102
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,720
encounter control apparatus imposed in a

103
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
top-down way

104
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,599
which makes life painful for the

105
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,840
innocent but can be circumvented by

106
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
guilty

107
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
now if you think about things like shift

108
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
left right

109
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
the goal is really like for a developer

110
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,120
and architect on each team to understand

111
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
things like threat modeling to help

112
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,959
build

113
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,360
systems more securely by design but

114
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
instead what we see with something

115
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
like shifting left is catch the os top

116
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,560
10 or whatever else our tools say is

117
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
important during the build phase rather

118
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,840
than the deployment phase

119
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
there's maybe a kind of benefit to

120
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
shifting that friction earlier but to be

121
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
real it's minimal and it certainly isn't

122
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
fulfilling the stated goal

123
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,319
a lot of tools security tools with pro

124
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,200
roi

125
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,959
are also hurting and punishing the

126
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,280
innocent and you're still bypassed by

127
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
the guilty

128
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
relatedly uh even though i still think

129
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
the buzzword is useless at best

130
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
sec ops kind of marches onto the stage

131
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,519
and says i'm not a regular security

132
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,640
theater i'm a cool security theater

133
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
in an ideal world deficit op should be

134
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,000
about similarly unifying

135
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,599
accountability and responsibility in the

136
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
realm of security just as

137
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
dev and ops was the unification of

138
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,239
responsibility and

139
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
accountability around operations the

140
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,319
real world though deficit ops is

141
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,000
basically just security theater with a

142
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
fresh makeover

143
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
it's deploying code and image scanners

144
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,798
rather than firewalls and antivirus

145
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,000
engines and adding the word

146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,160
automation in as many places as possible

147
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,840
the problem is it can't be just us

148
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
versus them right if security can't

149
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600
trust engineering teams that's a culture

150
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
problem and almost assuredly a process

151
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,080
problem

152
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
but it's not a technology problem as

153
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,000
we'll discuss in the next section

154
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
uh localizing changes is actually a much

155
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
better way to thrive

156
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,080
so when you see devsecops it's like

157
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
devops is like a building then security

158
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
is smashing through the building

159
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
like it's the kool-aid man and why stop

160
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
at devsecops why not devsec test stops

161
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,479
why not devsec tests and dba ops

162
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
right we're actually delivering secure

163
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
software then it's a seamless part of

164
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
devops processes and its insertion into

165
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,600
the buzzword is totally extraneous

166
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
that's the thing there's actually an

167
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
incentive on the security side for it

168
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,160
not to be seamless

169
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,800
and to still treat security is distinct

170
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
but equal

171
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
i actually discussed this in a recent

172
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
blog post about yoga sec versus fomo sec

173
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
i recommend you all checking out

174
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,320
but fomosar can be thought of security

175
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
uh security strategy that's driven by

176
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,080
fear of missing out and all of the

177
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,759
related thought patterns around it

178
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,199
so it gains the spotlight and fomo

179
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,880
seconds escaping the feeling of

180
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,919
inadequacy

181
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,680
you want to regain a sense that security

182
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
is in control and it isn't irrelevant

183
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,919
even if that's at the expense of

184
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
security outcomes

185
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,320
what's interesting is envy is actually

186
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
at the heart of fomo security and for

187
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,039
the context of

188
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,199
this talk the most relevant target of

189
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,880
infosex envy is actually software

190
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
engineers

191
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,160
so devon ops actually possess meaningful

192
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,120
goals and

193
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
that are part of meaningful work all of

194
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
which is measurable

195
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
and allows them to somewhat answer the

196
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,360
question of like did you deliver

197
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
software customers are actually going to

198
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
buy and use

199
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,639
infosec schools are largely nebulous and

200
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,039
its success is often abstractly shaped

201
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
and often bittersweet at best so when

202
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
security wants to cover every last inch

203
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,440
of attack surface when all

204
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
vulnerabilities are treated as mission

205
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,840
critical

206
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,600
when security approvals are demanded on

207
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
every last bit of new code

208
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
well all this is part of fomo sex

209
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
melodrama on stage at the security

210
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
theater

211
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
ironically though infosec's homosexual

212
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,479
and lust for the idea of being

213
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,960
treated equally to devon ops at the big

214
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
kids business table makes it lose sight

215
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
of organizational priorities

216
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
it's so intense on maintaining control

217
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
and feeling important that it actually

218
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
architects sub-optimal strategy that

219
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
keeps it from earning its seat at the

220
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,479
table

221
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
bombos sex histrionics around

222
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,759
desperately desiring feeling control

223
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,360
make infosec quite like someone who's

224
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,680
like

225
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
statically gripping a wheel even the

226
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
wheel isn't attached to anything

227
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
and all that fake steering maybe makes

228
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,319
you feel like you're doing something but

229
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
you're actually staying stagnant

230
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
and if you're staying stagnant there's

231
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,319
no way you're actually promoting safety

232
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,840
or security in your systems

233
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,080
as shown in dr nicole forsgren's state

234
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,199
of devops research

235
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,639
the elite organizations who have the

236
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
fastest deploy frequency and shortest

237
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,919
lead time for changes

238
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
also actually exhibit the lowest change

239
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,039
failure rates and shortest time to

240
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:15,440
restore

241
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,599
service that is speed and stability are

242
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,520
positively correlated

243
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
especially when you consider the typical

244
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
ratio of security engineers to software

245
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,680
engineers

246
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
it's basically impossible to scale any

247
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,400
sort of like heavy approval process

248
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,919
in fact like the organizations that have

249
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,840
the most restrictions in place and which

250
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,680
are in theory like the most careful

251
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
aren't actually the ones that are most

252
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,639
stable because they experience the

253
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,560
highest change failure rates

254
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
so these seemingly you know careful and

255
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,639
cautious organizations actually see

256
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,120
46 to 60 percent of their deployed

257
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
changes result in either

258
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,319
degraded service or something that

259
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
requires subsequent remediation

260
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
ultimately the lesson here is the more

261
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,599
hoops through which you jump

262
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
the more opportunities there are to fall

263
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,400
on your face

264
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,199
for instance if there's a nasty like

265
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,800
remote code execution vulnerability and

266
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
a library that's critical for one of

267
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
your product

268
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,879
production systems you want to fix that

269
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,160
quickly right

270
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,919
so a heavy and inconvenient change

271
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,599
management process will actually make it

272
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,120
harder to deploy a patch

273
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
which means your production systems will

274
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
languish with both security and

275
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
stability at risk

276
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
but if your process is speedy you can

277
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
push out patches and fixes and other

278
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
sorts of enhancements much faster which

279
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
allows for continuous improvement

280
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,759
of your system stability and security

281
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,159
instead

282
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,320
ultimately like a fortress of approvals

283
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
and red tape and

284
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
nebulous policy doesn't help your

285
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
security program as much as ensuring

286
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
that you can adapt your security program

287
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
as your system's environments evolve

288
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,640
you can test and fix things quickly and

289
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,200
easily

290
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,120
you can actually actually bolster

291
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,279
security far more than any sort of like

292
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,720
extra strict okay so we can probably

293
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
agree security theater is like not a

294
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
great time so how do we spot security

295
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,760
theaters red flags

296
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,800
and is there a better way ahead yes

297
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,320
there is

298
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,959
this brings us to act two which is

299
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,160
theater and chaos

300
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
and fisticuffs so there's conflict born

301
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,640
from how we should treat security

302
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,240
failure and where accountability for

303
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
security rests

304
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
on one side we have security theater and

305
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,680
on the other there stands security chaos

306
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
engineering

307
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,160
we're exploring these tensions presently

308
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
the tldr on security cams engineering is

309
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
that it seeks to leverage failure as a

310
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,200
learning opportunity

311
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
and as a chance to build knowledge of

312
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,399
systems level dynamics

313
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,320
towards continuously improving systems

314
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
resilience i'm actually releasing a

315
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
report on this topic with my co-author

316
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,560
aaron reinhardt

317
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
might actually be out by the time this

318
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
airs by o'reilly so check that out if

319
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
you want a deeper dive into the topic

320
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,839
again security uh theaters five isn't

321
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,959
nearly as chill

322
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,720
they would like to feel absolutely harsh

323
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
or mellow so the security team that acts

324
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,560
in the security theater troop

325
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
wants to avoid failure by any means

326
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
necessary and punishes chosen

327
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,279
humans involved when incidents occur

328
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,040
obviously these are odds so this brings

329
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,360
us to scene one and act two

330
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,399
the duel let's do some comparing

331
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,000
teams to adopt security cast engineering

332
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
are very clue about things

333
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
they radically accept that failure is a

334
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
part of any sort of complex system that

335
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,279
continuously changes

336
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
they don't expect to know all the ways

337
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
things can fail so they instead

338
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
pursue and incentivize feedback loops

339
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
and experimentation to uncover

340
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
evidence of how systems behave teams who

341
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
adopt security theater though are pretty

342
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
stubborn they lament that if only

343
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,320
you know humans followed all of the

344
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
infosec laws and the kingdom perfectly

345
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,959
incidents wouldn't happen these are lazy

346
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,800
or stupider the aforementioned bad

347
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,959
apples so they deserve to be ruled with

348
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,399
sort of iron fist

349
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,079
despite the fact that policies are never

350
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,079
going to be globally applied given the

351
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,120
reality of context

352
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
nuance another comparison is security

353
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,240
programs following security chaos

354
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
engineering are designed to minimize the

355
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,160
impact of incidents by making incident

356
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,320
recovery as efficient and graceful as

357
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
possible

358
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
so teams know that know that pointing

359
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
fingers is useless and that conducting

360
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
experiments to power feedback loops

361
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,720
instead

362
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,519
is incredibly valuable security programs

363
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,800
though that are following a security

364
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
theater approach use technology and

365
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
policy to eliminate the possibility of

366
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,560
failure if they can which they can't

367
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
and allow for easier blame when

368
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
incidents happen but no one can

369
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
enumerate all possible failure in any

370
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
sort of complex system

371
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,279
and keep any failure from happening with

372
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,480
control so you know

373
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,920
i guess we'll see teams pursuing

374
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,640
circadian

375
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
engineering want to unify accountability

376
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
responsibility by handing off acceptance

377
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,279
of risk

378
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,800
to the engineering teams that are

379
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
actually performing work

380
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
which we refer to as localized change

381
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,519
approvals

382
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,519
so the security team instead operates as

383
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
an advisor sharing knowledge as widely

384
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,640
as possible

385
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
in the o'reilly report we also talk

386
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,079
about the idea of security champions

387
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
very closely related teams performing

388
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,399
security theater though in contrast

389
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,240
are really thirsty for bottlenecks and

390
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
silos so the security team is generally

391
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,000
in charge of approving or denying

392
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
changes and releases despite the fact

393
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
that they're actually divorced from the

394
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
systems in the work itself

395
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,120
importantly though this bottleneck and

396
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
this requirement for security approvals

397
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,680
is actually seen

398
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,160
as providing security in itself even

399
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,200
though neither of those are actually

400
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,920
security

401
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,200
outcomes as far as culture security cast

402
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,560
engineering is all about a culture of

403
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,440
security uh

404
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
culture curiosity that's always down for

405
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,839
like a healthy retrospective and an open

406
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,120
discussion of oofs

407
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
even big moves and teams feel super safe

408
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
coming forward about security issues

409
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
because they know they won't be

410
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
ridiculed or blamed

411
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,360
and also they know that problems can

412
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
actually be solved collaboratively

413
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,279
security theater of course is the

414
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,600
opposite because of its fear of change

415
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,680
that also means it has a fear of

416
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,519
learning so teams would rather keep

417
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,959
security issues quiet

418
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,959
and hidden in secret so they don't face

419
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,959
retribution or disruption

420
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,800
honestly it's all around a bad vibe

421
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
and finally uh security teams with the

422
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
security cast engineering approach are

423
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:54,720
all about

424
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
providing a guiding light so that

425
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,399
unfamiliar situations can be approached

426
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,560
constructively they welcome audience

427
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
participation and challenging

428
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
assumptions about security strategy

429
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
because it's accepted that security

430
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,600
strategy has to evolve as your systems

431
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,839
and your environmental context involves

432
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
evolves but security teams with a

433
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,920
security theater approach instead are a

434
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,360
stickler for rules and they find the

435
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,200
status quo very comforting

436
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
they would much rather copy-paste

437
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
policies over from the world they're

438
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
familiar with to this new scary world

439
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
which is why you see things like

440
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
container firewalls which

441
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,440
don't make a lot of sense so ultimately

442
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
do you want to thrive

443
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,880
in the real world or do you want to try

444
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,720
to survive in security theater's

445
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
fantasy world but security chaos

446
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
engineering's teams are ultimately

447
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
accepting reality and especially the

448
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,600
reality that security just

449
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,440
isn't the most important priority to

450
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,199
most organizations

451
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,720
it's really about you know building a

452
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
custom base like fueling revenue growth

453
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,600
improving

454
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,079
profitability and so forth with security

455
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,279
theater it's almost like teams are

456
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
method acting so hard that they start to

457
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,959
believe in this fantasyland

458
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,639
and they start to feel that security

459
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,399
actually is the top priority

460
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
and you know there's this elaborate song

461
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
and dance required to fulfill it

462
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,360
it's just not true so those who actually

463
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,800
adopt a security cast engineering

464
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,279
approach

465
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,760
want to produce meaningful outcomes they

466
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,199
don't care about doing something just

467
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,560
for appearances sake

468
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
again going back to that blog post i

469
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,639
mentioned on yolo second fomosec

470
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,480
security chaos engineering also doesn't

471
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,079
encourage uh i

472
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,320
feel like caring about feeling important

473
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
or buying the latest security shiny just

474
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,480
because

475
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
everyone else is doing it that's really

476
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,240
important

477
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
the other thing is that most engineering

478
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,440
teams already understand that

479
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,519
bugs that could disrupt uh performance

480
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,639
are inevitable so they try to

481
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,079
continually test and refine their

482
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,320
systems to get the results they want

483
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
security chaos engineering thinks super

484
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,399
similarly to this which means that

485
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,240
it's actually aligning to how developers

486
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,399
and operators already operate

487
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,079
so security bugs exist this

488
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
configurations are a fact of life keys

489
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,480
are

490
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,760
accidentally going to be pasted into

491
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
code it's quite silly to think that just

492
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
because some security checks passed once

493
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,040
that everything is perfect

494
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
on the flip side joining the security

495
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
theater actually results in a dangerous

496
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,639
and self-fulfilling prophecy

497
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,639
if everyone is treated like a bad apple

498
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,920
they're more likely to hide

499
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
and keep secrets which ironically

500
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,760
actually turns the innocence

501
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,839
into bad apples that's terrible

502
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,040
instead they're going to now start

503
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
covering up mistakes and they're going

504
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
to be too scared or resentful to

505
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,199
actually raise concerns which

506
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,839
totally dismantles your feedback loop

507
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
and honestly it also erodes the security

508
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
team's political capital which

509
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,199
as much as we would like that not to

510
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
exist it's a fact of most

511
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,000
like organizational realities and so

512
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
without this feedback loop how can you

513
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
actually be certain that your security

514
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
program is working

515
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
this brings us to scene two about

516
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,639
judgment

517
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,160
security chaos engineering welcomes

518
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
objective judgment whereas security

519
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
theater would rather bribe the judges

520
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
so classic a red flag of like any sort

521
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,800
of security theater is that it's nearly

522
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
impossible to directly tie costs to

523
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,279
benefits

524
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
there's often a lot of hand waving and

525
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
purposely vague math

526
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,639
at all it's sometimes alarming at least

527
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,079
in my experience to discover

528
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,320
or often rediscover how few infosec

529
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,680
leaders and professionals can actually

530
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,360
articulate the roi

531
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
on the dollar spent in their security

532
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,560
programs

533
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
i think we can all understand that not

534
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
being able to how to uh articulate how

535
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
dollar spent transforming to

536
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,959
organizational benefits is super

537
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,079
problematic

538
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,519
so moving towards security chaos

539
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,959
engineering is actually a movement

540
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,519
towards

541
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,360
creating success criteria so you can

542
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
keep track of the efficacy of your

543
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,160
security program

544
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,120
in a quantifiable way so it's obvious

545
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
but you either want to prove that you've

546
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,320
avoided a monetary loss which is more

547
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
common in infosec

548
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,680
or that you're helping your organization

549
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
make more money

550
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
definitely rare in infosec but i think

551
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,959
we can get there

552
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,560
problem is this calculation also needs

553
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,839
to consider the effects that your

554
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,639
security program

555
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,959
has on other parts of the organization

556
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,639
in economics literature this is what's

557
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
referred to as negative externalities

558
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,639
so drawing on an example in the physical

559
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,199
security domain one study by blalock

560
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,880
and their colleagues suggested that road

561
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,720
fatalities actually increased as a

562
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
result of airport security theater

563
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,399
because more people decided to try

564
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,079
rather than deal with all of that pain

565
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,319
at the airport

566
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,400
so security metrics as a result of all

567
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
this are often way too tone-deaf to what

568
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,400
the rest of the organization is doing

569
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
no one cares about your number of

570
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
phishing link clicks just like no one

571
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
cares about line of code written on the

572
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,599
engineering side

573
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
it's a huge huge mistake not to include

574
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,599
these negative externalities in your

575
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,799
measurement as it keeps you from

576
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,480
measuring security efficacy

577
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
holistically any measurement of infosec

578
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
efficacy needs to look at other teams

579
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
measurements to track whether there's

580
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
increased friction

581
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,840
or some sort of inconvenience that's

582
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
being engendered

583
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,760
so an increase for instance of code

584
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,440
review coverage by the security program

585
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,160
could actually be a great thing but is

586
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
it actually great if critical software

587
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,280
delivery metrics like lead time or

588
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,840
deploy

589
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,799
frequency are being hurt as a result so

590
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,320
it's obviously ridiculous to assume that

591
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
any change in the security program is

592
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,919
like uh or any change in an engineering

593
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,440
metric is the direct result of the

594
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,880
security program right

595
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
the point is that these metrics open up

596
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
the opportunity for investigation

597
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,160
you want to investigate security's

598
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,080
impact on software delivery and ensure

599
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,919
there aren't any negative consequences

600
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,360
to the policies and programs you're

601
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,640
instituting

602
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
because otherwise those might appear

603
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,760
like security improvements

604
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,720
when they're actually not as is likely

605
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
obvious like this is going to require

606
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,360
collaboration both

607
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
between security and software

608
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,799
engineering the mutual

609
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,200
benefits are right for the picking as is

610
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,840
explored

611
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,919
in that ireland report i mentioned on

612
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,240
security cams engineering

613
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,559
so now we reach the grand finale

614
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
so security theater prioritizes

615
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,679
gatekeeping it prefers to

616
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
punish humans for supposedly causing

617
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,880
failures

618
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,640
even if it leads to a fear of learning

619
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
that actually stifles continuous

620
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,440
improvement

621
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,320
and that's what we all want so when

622
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
security teams serve as this kind of

623
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,480
uh you know an authoritarian external

624
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
approval

625
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
approver bottlenecks are inevitable and

626
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
this friction in turns actually leads to

627
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,520
longer deploy times and larger

628
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
deployment sizes both of which seriously

629
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,120
jeopardize stability

630
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,400
and thus security so again continuous

631
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
improvement is our goal for systems

632
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
uh performance and it also should be for

633
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,720
system stability as well

634
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
and security chaos engineering is the

635
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,080
path to get there

636
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
plus i mean we constantly hear about how

637
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,280
attackers are constantly evolving their

638
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
methods and they're so far ahead

639
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
so shouldn't our defenders and our

640
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,679
defense continually be evolving too

641
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,120
makes sense right so security teams

642
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,960
as we discuss in the report can be freed

643
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
from the burden of heavy-handed control

644
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,799
and they can instead become advisors

645
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,559
allowing them to focus on more strategic

646
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,280
work

647
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,559
product and engineering teams are

648
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,000
actually the ones that start to accept

649
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,679
accountability for all these security

650
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,720
changes

651
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
and importantly cleaning up any

652
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
resulting impact of these changes

653
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,919
which makes for healthier security for

654
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,760
everyone

655
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,559
so i hope today all of you are very

656
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
motivated to close the curtain on

657
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,919
security theater and let speed and

658
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,919
stability instead flow in concert

659
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
through the security chaos engineering

660
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,760
approach i always like to close with a

661
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,480
quote

662
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,600
so i'll invoke chuck paul yuck

663
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
classic kind of monologue tradition at

664
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,720
the theater people don't want their

665
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,520
lives fixed

666
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
nobody wants their problem solved their

667
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
dramas their distractions their stories

668
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,240
resolved

669
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,080
their mess is cleaned up because what

670
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
would they have left

671
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,799
just a big scary unknown again

672
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,480
um this was only surface dive in

673
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,000
security gas engineering which we're

674
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,039
really excited about

675
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,200
um so check out the o'reilly report i

676
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
wrote with my co-author aaron reinhart

677
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
it is available for free should be at

678
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,679
the link by the time this airs

679
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,840
so download and dive into it and again

680
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
hopefully close the theater

681
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,640
at close the curtain on security theater

682
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,679
that thank you all very much
