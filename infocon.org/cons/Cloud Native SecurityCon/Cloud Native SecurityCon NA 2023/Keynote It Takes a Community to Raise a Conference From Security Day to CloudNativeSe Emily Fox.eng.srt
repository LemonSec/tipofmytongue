1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
hello everyone I'm Emily Fox for those

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,799
of you that are familiar with me you

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,660
probably see me pop up in a lot of

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,039
different open source communities in

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,540
addition to the cloud native Computing

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,580
Foundation today though I'm going to

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,540
talk to you a little bit about the

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,000
history behind this event for those of

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,199
you that have been in the cloud native

10
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,180
security for a while now you'll know

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,340
this event is very near and dear to me

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,039
it's basically my baby I love this event

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,680
because it was my first big project that

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
I volunteered to assist with when I

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,939
joined the open source community and it

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,980
was also kind of the first time I had

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,320
heard of the security technical Advisory

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,719
Group however at the time they were

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,100
called the special interest group for

20
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,960
security

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,800
it was 2019 I was in Barcelona attending

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,840
kubecon Cloud native Con Europe and it

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,700
was there that I was introduced to Cloud

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,340
native security and this group they were

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,200
evaluating the security posture of

26
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,760
several Cloud native projects I was

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,620
researching at the time for a project

28
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,840
that I was working on it was there that

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,820
I attended to talk from Justin cormack

30
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,460
on Project Security reviews

31
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,040
in addition to kindly answering all of

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,260
my barrage of questions both on camera

33
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,960
and off camera he mentioned to me that I

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,220
should probably check out this group

35
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,080
they were still young in the cloud

36
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,479
native space the foundation was still

37
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,700
kind of growing and ramping up they were

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,680
looking to break new ground and develop

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,340
new practices to allow us to apply

40
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,619
traditional security practices into

41
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,020
Cloud native technology stacks and

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,520
really Drive What mattered in this

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
growing community space and as always

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,659
open source is always looking for

45
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,579
contributors and Technical advisory

46
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,500
groups and special interest groups are

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
no exception so you'll hear me refer to

48
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,640
them as the security tag or sync

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,020
security throughout this talk but

50
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,939
ultimately it's the same group of

51
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,320
fabulous people

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,659
so I started lurking in their meetings

53
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,759
just like dialing into the zoom sessions

54
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,140
trying to understand a little bit more

55
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,820
about what they were talking about what

56
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,020
they're trying to accomplish reading

57
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,000
their docs asking clarifying questions

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,979
to make sure that I understood the

59
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,899
direction that this group was heading in

60
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,100
they had a

61
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,200
ask to fulfill their mission and their

62
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,240
Charter but

63
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,758
enthusiastic encouraging and flexible

64
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,560
and understanding like we're still

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,180
trying to figure a lot of this stuff out

66
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,640
but ultimately what we needed to do was

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
figure out how do we prevent

68
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,120
unauthorized access for cloud native

69
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,860
applications and workloads in a way that

70
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,560
makes sense for all of the adopters in

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,540
addition to the maintainers of these

72
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,940
projects and as long as our work aligned

73
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,680
underneath is the three primary focus

74
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,420
areas of the charter

75
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,459
we were Unstoppable

76
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,920
the charter was set up so that the tag

77
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,620
could fill the Gap in security guidance

78
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,080
instruction and tooling and well just

79
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,819
generally provide information that

80
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,160
wasn't there at the time organizations

81
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,379
were leveraging Heritage and checklist

82
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,300
security requirements completely

83
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,519
ignorant of all the possibilities that

84
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,620
cloud native could provide from a

85
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,440
security perspective so we set out to

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
Define how to protect workloads to

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,220
ensure that they're still usable where

88
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,260
security is not a noticeable hindrance

89
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,800
to the user or the engineer's workflow

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
we also needed to figure out how can we

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
take the existing security control

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,819
bodies and apply those principles to

93
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,920
establish a common understanding and

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,780
corresponding tooling to help developers

95
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,940
really meet those security requirements

96
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,920
but perhaps the hardest and most complex

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,440
yet we're still trying to solve is how

98
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,819
do we break down the complexity in

99
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,159
audits because Auditors really need to

100
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,019
have an understanding of how Cloud

101
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,580
native architectures are supposed to be

102
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,459
developed built and operated in a secure

103
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,420
manner

104
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,180
oh and do that for every single domain

105
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
because kubernetes is just one of the

106
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,739
many faucets of cloud native security

107
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,379
and you can make an argument that due to

108
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,120
the Natural complexity that kubernetes

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,640
has it is its own domain of expertise

110
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,340
the stickers on this slide are just a

111
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,319
couple of the domains that we still need

112
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,420
to do explore at the time and they are

113
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,879
their own domain expertise areas

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,360
oh and we had we couldn't really fit all

115
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,340
of those into the cubecon cloud native

116
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,379
con security track and talk about

117
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,420
kubernetes at the same time there just

118
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,580
wasn't enough space and many of these

119
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,860
domains hadn't been approached from a

120
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,040
security perspective in 2019 we needed

121
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,320
an Avenue and a place to explore and

122
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,139
kind of Drive content along these areas

123
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,600
to inform adopters and maintainers about

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,639
how we should be doing Security in these

125
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,460
specific areas we needed that Avenue to

126
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,020
build up Security in Cloud native

127
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,000
because it is more than just kubernetes

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,880
it is a multi-objective

129
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,680
multi-constrained problem space with a

130
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,600
lot of different domains it spans the

131
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,440
entire sdlc and whatever comes next we

132
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,360
have to be prepared for it

133
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,280
so Michael Ducey one of our community

134
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,259
members at the time who he had

135
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,400
previously been running some local

136
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,860
devops days and was really into the open

137
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,860
space scene he filed issue number 209 in

138
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,680
June of 2019 to propose a one-day event

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,960
that went beyond the current security

140
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,720
track at kubecon there were 14 of us

141
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,060
that jumped on board for that issue when

142
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,860
we started planning we used the GitHub

143
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,960
issue to plan all of our meeting notes

144
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
and a Trello board to figure out how the

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,460
heck do you run a conference and how the

146
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,960
heck do you figure out what an open

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,940
space schedule should look like for a

148
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,560
security conference

149
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,320
we had a lot of amazing submissions and

150
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,419
we were able to gather to pull together

151
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,419
an amazing day of talks as well as a

152
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,460
full open space schedule to really drive

153
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,880
a lot of discussions Ian Coldwater in

154
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,800
Coldwater and Duffy Cooley started our

155
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,020
day off as a throwback to kubernetes

156
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,300
talking about kubernetes defaults and

157
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,060
how do we move forward in that space

158
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,880
if you look back at the first open space

159
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,460
schedule in the first Sig security day

160
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,860
talks you'll find a lot of the same

161
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,740
topics that we talked about in 2019 are

162
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,080
still being talked about here today but

163
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,639
the difference is that now that we know

164
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,560
more we can share a lot of those

165
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,240
learnings with our peers and colleagues

166
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,100
and build on top of each other's

167
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,120
learnings

168
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,820
and you'll also find out we talked about

169
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,860
software supply chain security attacks

170
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,900
before it was cool we talked about

171
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,000
defaults we talked about compliance and

172
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
machine learning and it was a lot to

173
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,500
cover in just a single day event

174
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,539
it was a huge success the program

175
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,039
committee and myself and the other

176
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,900
colleagues were stoked to hold another

177
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,180
one and make it bigger make it better so

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,699
in 2020 we held one for Europe because

179
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,440
we wanted to ensure that the European

180
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,180
audiences security concerns and Care

181
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,160
abouts were similar or at least

182
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,560
addressed within this conference and

183
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,120
then later that year because that one

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,979
was a success we did the same thing for

185
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,680
North America in 20 and 2020.

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,259
what we did though is after that initial

187
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,479
event we performed a retrospective to

188
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,180
really understand going from day one to

189
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,979
the second event and the third event to

190
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,919
get community members feedback we had a

191
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,419
lot of interest from folks so Twitter

192
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,060
chatter was strong excellent uh

193
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,979
discussions by community members and the

194
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,680
open space Arena and then

195
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,900
we we got a little hint that people

196
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,220
wanted something a little bit more

197
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,960
Hands-On they wanted workshops they

198
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,699
wanted tutorials they wanted something

199
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,680
to allow them to take the theory of

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,840
cloud native Security and apply it into

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,060
practice so

202
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,860
that's what we decided to do with that

203
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,240
North America

204
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,419
we held a CTF and it was fabulous if you

205
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,280
were here yesterday you heard Andy and

206
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,039
Andres talk about how we executed those

207
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,139
ctfs and how our community members

208
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,060
responded and that's kind of been the

209
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,699
thing with a lot of this is partnering

210
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,560
with new community members on what we

211
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,419
can do to make this a positive

212
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,880
experience for everyone making sure that

213
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,800
they have those Lessons Learned and that

214
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,199
they can take them back with them to

215
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,360
their companies and organizations with

216
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,520
the correct skills to uplift their

217
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,800
overall security showing how attackers

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
can compromise containers in a fun and

219
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,520
engaging way

220
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,340
and it's not just the attendees that get

221
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,039
a lot of value from this event

222
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,240
individuals that run these events and

223
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,000
participate in the open source community

224
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,340
they're leveling up their skills they're

225
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,199
able to identify gaps and challenges

226
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,300
being experienced by adopters through

227
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,860
discussions with their colleagues and

228
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,780
peers and hallway tracks or in open

229
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,240
space talks they're also able to

230
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
strategically leverage some of that

231
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,720
event content to drive attendees like

232
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,539
you to talk to each other figure out

233
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,240
what's going on in API security how did

234
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,500
you all solve this most recent

235
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,660
vulnerability what are you doing to

236
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,520
improve your software supply chain and

237
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,020
what is the evolution of that look like

238
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,180
for your company over the past four or

239
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,458
five years because ultimately we're all

240
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,500
trying to do the same thing uplift

241
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,360
security

242
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,580
and we've been able to increase

243
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,339
Industries attention to security and

244
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,140
Cloud native over these past four years

245
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,339
because and we're going to continue

246
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,980
doing it because there was and continues

247
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,200
to be a gap and while that Gap is

248
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
significantly smaller we're still

249
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,920
growing this space and learning and

250
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,040
uncovering new areas to explore you can

251
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,200
see from the metrics on this slide we've

252
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,180
doubled the amount of security projects

253
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,740
and products in the cloud native

254
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,500
Computing foundation's landscape we've

255
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,060
increased the amount of Security reviews

256
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,700
on projects that we had we even had a

257
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,860
major review process revision and we're

258
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,660
talking about doing another one to

259
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,820
really drive more value to maintainers

260
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
as well as adopters and it's because of

261
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,800
the First Security day and all the

262
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
security days that came after evolving

263
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,940
into this conference that allowed us to

264
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,959
provide a place for security

265
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,959
practitioners to exchange learn in a way

266
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,640
that was not addressed by the previous

267
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,019
security conferences

268
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,420
this conference is an Avenue to share

269
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,060
your experience and to learn from others

270
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,220
I would like to see it continue to

271
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,620
expand Beyond just Cloud native security

272
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,260
into open source security because both

273
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,720
of these are complementary fields and as

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,519
we see more maturity in Cloud native

275
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,040
security tools projects guides

276
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,200
documentation and resources we're seeing

277
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
them applied outside of cloud native

278
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
architectures

279
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
this event has grown because of

280
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,339
attendees like you and those that came

281
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,800
before you but it was started because of

282
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,779
the cloud native security community and

283
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,640
in particular the volunteers and

284
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,959
passionate members of the security

285
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,240
technical Advisory Group who have driven

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,180
more content from their work into this

287
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,040
conference and this is the work that

288
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
moves Cloud native security forward

289
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,180
connecting members solving problems

290
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,339
establishing best practices and sharing

291
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,500
what we've learned I want you all to

292
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,300
take this opportunity to network with

293
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,040
your peers talk about some of the

294
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
challenges you're experiencing and how

295
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,700
you've solved them as a throwback to the

296
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,560
original open space and collaborative

297
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,420
nature that this conference started from

298
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,090
thank you

299
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,080
[Applause]
