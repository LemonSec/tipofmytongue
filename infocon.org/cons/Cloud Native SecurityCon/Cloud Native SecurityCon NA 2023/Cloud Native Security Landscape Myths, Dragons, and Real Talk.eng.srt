1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,399
well I'll get going then so hi welcome

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,799
to this panel on cloud native security

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,820
landscape myth dragons and real talk and

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,219
the reason I put this panel together was

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,259
I think basically

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,880
as you had seen from this morning the

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,100
Keynotes and so on this is a very active

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,380
developing space and I think even for

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
those of us who are working in it are

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,340
very confusing developing space is to

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,380
know well what is exciting for the next

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,240
five years what is practical now and so

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,640
on and so we'll get into why these

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,859
people lovely people are here

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:32,579
um

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,520
just a few moments of talk so I hi I'm

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,280
Ed I work at systig on open source and

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,860
Falco in particular

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,000
so I asked GPT like everybody you know

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,739
what what do you think of the acronyms

21
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,420
that Gartner uses about security just

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,160
because I wanted to say

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,719
like you I'm swimming in these things

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,360
and I hate them and surely it should be

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,160
more simple to understand sort of

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,300
Gartner

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,640
has got some of these going on

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,379
great well maybe maybe they like

29
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,000
acronyms too much let's let's ask

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Forrester now for us to have their own

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,619
set that they really like in chat GPT

32
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:09,960
thinks of theirs so we have chance to

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,020
reinvent the world in open source we're

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,340
standing on the shoulders of giants

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,040
surely we can see more clearly than

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,540
everyone who's gone before us in the

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,759
industry and not follow the same

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,799
confusing example well I'm sorry but

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
we're inventing our own set of acronyms

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
to go with them uh chat GPT probably

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
trained too late in the day to

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
understand most of the ones we're

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,140
swimming in the thing like guac salsa

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,579
rest Bombs all these things that are

45
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,720
coming out

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,700
all really important or their place in

47
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,920
the world the way do we sit

48
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,259
well one place we don't start is with a

49
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,840
simple architecture this was from the

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,000
slide this morning in the keynote just

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,520
demonstrating some of the complexity of

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,060
the attack surface in Cloud native apps

53
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,140
and and installations

54
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,240
so that's why I gathered for friends who

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,920
know everything there is to know about

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,240
their part of the world to try and

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,820
simplify some of this for us try and

58
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,220
give us some guides as to what is

59
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,080
the best place to pay attention in Cloud

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,400
native security right now

61
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,900
in addition to the technology the other

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,220
thing we want to make sure we cover in

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,599
this panel is kind of all these human

64
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,700
elements we hear a lot about the

65
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,200
software supply chain we know that we

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,300
have to pay attention not to just what

67
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,640
is actually running but the whole life

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,280
cycle deploy distribute develop this is

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,560
from the tag security report on cloud

70
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,700
native security by the way

71
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,099
so as we get going I want to make sure

72
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,200
you do some work as well in the crowd

73
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,940
because I think we'd love to get a

74
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,040
sample of where you're at so I've got

75
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,080
some easy things from easy to hard raise

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,819
your hand if you're using GitHub in

77
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,620
production seriously

78
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,140
okay still not everybody's it's good

79
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,140
kubernetes

80
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,739
okay what about on clouds versus on-prem

81
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,840
in the cloud

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,660
okay your hands down on Prem

83
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,220
thank you

84
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,500
and who was using any open source

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,260
security tools right now

86
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,720
I know you are Polaris

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,700
um could you catch out any of those out

88
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,299
please

89
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,000
Falco thank you crowd

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,080
any others

91
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,839
I think Emily you're cheating

92
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,980
Cuba it's awesome thank you well

93
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,599
hopefully this gives everyone here a

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,019
little uh sample of where we're at

95
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,700
so I'd love to introduce my panelists

96
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm going to get down from this sort of

97
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
god-like overview and come around the

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,860
side now so we can have a chat

99
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,780
uh well

100
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,000
we can introduce in any in any order in

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,959
particular

102
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:52,739
um

103
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,299
but I've asked the panelists to maybe

104
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,140
spend about 90 seconds introducing

105
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,220
themselves where they come from kind of

106
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,540
what they're working on

107
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,700
um Kim should we go from you almost

108
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,040
thank you sure hey everyone Thanks for

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,140
thanks for joining today my name is Kim

110
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,500
Lewandowski I'm currently the head of

111
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,480
product and a co-founder of a new

112
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,580
startup called chain guard we're about a

113
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,918
year old now trying to help with all

114
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,540
this software supply chain security

115
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,899
stuff prior to chain guard I was at

116
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,900
Google for almost a decade working on

117
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,360
some developer tools stuff and Cloud

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,300
products and then security and then

119
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,699
before I was a product manager I was a

120
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,100
developer so I went to the dark side

121
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,979
and so yeah that's me so Kim what are

122
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,180
you working on right now that people

123
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,120
need to know about oh wow so

124
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
um yeah I mean a chain guard we have

125
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,120
some Enterprise Products around security

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,120
space so two of them right now one is a

127
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,680
risk management platform called chain

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,919
Garden Force to help organizations get a

129
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,020
handle on their supply chain security

130
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,199
posture and give them some tools and

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,000
help them get better and then we have

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
another product called chain guard

133
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,139
images which are hardened container

134
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,060
based images with all the software

135
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,820
supply chain goodness baked in they're

136
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,699
reproducible we carry the pagers we

137
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,500
patch them for vulnerabilities they come

138
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,160
with s-bombs produced at build time and

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,900
yeah pretty cool and so those are the

140
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,400
main focus right now and we've been

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
growing our teams a lot of management

142
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,039
and getting everyone rallied

143
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,400
so that life's easy right completely

144
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,900
loris

145
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,720
hi everyone my name is Loris dejani I'm

146
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,120
a CTO and founder at systick

147
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,039
is my second company my first company

148
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,320
was called case Technologies and was the

149
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,039
commercial entity behind in open source

150
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,400
Network analyzer called Wireshark so

151
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,759
I've been involved with open source

152
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,900
pretty much my whole career now one of

153
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,400
the roles that they ever since dig is

154
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,060
leading the open source team for the

155
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,680
first part of my career it was more like

156
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,600
computer networks and network analysis

157
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,419
and then after starting this day in 2014

158
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,199
focusing a lot in Cloud native security

159
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,720
and visibility one of the things that we

160
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,460
do at this day is Falco the open source

161
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,560
runtime detection tool which is part of

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,360
the cncf

163
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,000
for us

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,500
hey so what's up everyone I'm Randall

165
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,740
nice to meet all of you uh so I've been

166
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,780
working in Security in a lot of weird

167
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,819
positions just for my whole life

168
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,380
um I got started doing operating system

169
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,600
security for openbsd a really long time

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,419
ago uh then I wrote and sold video game

171
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,300
hacks for years which was pretty fun

172
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,660
um then I got into the uh the I am space

173
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,400
working on authentication and

174
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,259
authorization for developers and I did

175
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,600
that at a company called storm path and

176
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,280
we later got acquired by OCTA and then

177
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,080
we built the developer platform at OCTA

178
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,479
and now I work at sneak doing devrel

179
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,180
which is super fun and basically we are

180
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,620
just trying to make it easier to find

181
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,539
and fix vulnerabilities in the software

182
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,400
that everyone is writing so yeah that's

183
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,440
me so Randall just before you head on

184
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,660
what does snake do exactly oh yeah so if

185
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,800
you are not familiar with sneak please

186
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,620
raise your hand real fast yeah Okay cool

187
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,960
so we're a developer security tool so

188
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,580
you can plug Us in and we do static

189
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,380
analysis of the software you're writing

190
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,900
to help find vulnerabilities we also

191
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,180
look at dependencies container images we

192
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,039
have a cloud security product Etc but

193
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,960
just everything developer is security

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,460
related

195
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,740
thanks Isaac

196
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,960
hi everyone uh and uh thanks for coming

197
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,479
I'm glad to be here my name is Isaac I'm

198
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,280
a product manager at Google

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,940
um

200
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,880
right now at Google I work in supply

201
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,500
chain security

202
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,360
um two parts of my work number one is I

203
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,160
work closely with the Google open source

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,539
security team

205
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,300
um you know um who behind the

206
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,460
um things are sick store and and salsa

207
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,919
and guac is a new project I saw a slide

208
00:07:58,919 --> 00:07:59,819
earlier

209
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,460
um that I've been working on as well

210
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,199
um and then the other side of my work is

211
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,940
on Google's internal first party supply

212
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,919
chain and so I do a lot of work there

213
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,180
right now

214
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,740
um on Google's first party production of

215
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,360
s-bombs and conformance with the

216
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,740
executive order

217
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,240
um some of you may be familiar with

218
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,800
um my history

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,500
um less 15 or so years been at Google

220
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,979
Microsoft Twitter stripe as a product

221
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,520
manager and then in in pre-history again

222
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,919
like him was a developer so I also

223
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,539
flipped to the dark side a little while

224
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,440
back

225
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,080
glad to be here thank you I think well

226
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,520
thank you so much for being here panel

227
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,140
and hopefully you've got an idea of what

228
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,520
everyone's expert on and what we can

229
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,039
talk about an exercise for you during

230
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,260
the course of the panel I had meant to

231
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,880
sit everybody left to right in terms of

232
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,740
a place in the supply chain if you can

233
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,240
figure this out and tell us what order

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,740
people should be sitting in by the time

235
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,320
we're done then there is a non-specific

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,899
prize of little value for you if some of

237
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,120
us shifting left or shifting right

238
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,300
you must give your answer only in uh

239
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,640
assembly code please uh bit shifts thank

240
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,779
you

241
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,700
awesome well we'll get going by the way

242
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,140
this is intended for you to be able to

243
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,640
ask questions as well I've obviously

244
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,200
prepared some in case you're so full of

245
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,760
lunch you just want to be entertained

246
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,940
but like feel free to stick your hand up

247
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,399
I'll call on you and and challenge folks

248
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,899
ask questions we'd like to keep this

249
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,760
interesting and I think the most

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,800
interesting people here are actually you

251
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,560
no offense panel but we want to hear you

252
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,540
know the broad range of concerns from

253
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,040
the audience

254
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,120
so

255
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm getting kicked off and just um you

256
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,720
can choose your own order to answer

257
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,000
panel but you know you've also you've

258
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
all talked about different places

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,019
different focuses in the supply chain

260
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,700
and we hear a lot of things

261
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,260
that are important coming from your

262
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,019
regions a lot of things that we as as

263
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,300
users and as operators need to pay

264
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,399
attention to so from your part of the

265
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,200
world what do you think is the single

266
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,540
most important thing you're telling

267
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,740
people about or the single most

268
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,920
important issue you feel people should

269
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
be paying attention to right now

270
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,399
I'll go for it

271
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,160
um so I think you know people talk about

272
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,320
the supply chain a lot and the you know

273
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,580
the standard diagram I've seen at least

274
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,500
16 times already today

275
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,360
um and I think you know there are

276
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,160
various projects particularly in open

277
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,200
source addressing um points of weakness

278
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,060
in the supply chain and you know so

279
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,820
salsa focused on build integrity and and

280
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,680
tamper-proofing artifacts and so on and

281
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,480
the uh you know being an anchor your

282
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,580
trust in a build system

283
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,800
um I think more fundamentally or one of

284
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,959
the areas that folks struggle with and

285
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,880
seems to be a very high priority to me

286
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
is really um becoming aware if you're

287
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,980
not already aware I'm accelerating

288
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,079
becoming aware of what your software

289
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,779
dependencies are and so looking I'm you

290
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,339
know Upstream in terms of the software

291
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,320
you're ingesting you know we've seen

292
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
stats around you know 85 to 97 percent

293
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
of commercial software um you know has

294
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,680
some open source as part of its

295
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,019
dependency and I think there's there's a

296
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,060
universal feeling that you know taking

297
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,560
open source dependencies in your

298
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,860
software you know introduces some risk

299
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,940
and I think that there's you know that's

300
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,040
a well understood concept and people get

301
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,920
that um but it's a very uh it's very

302
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,079
unspecific it's rather a feeling or a

303
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,700
vibe that people get that there's not

304
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,459
very difficult to quantify that risk um

305
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,260
it's very difficult to assess it it's a

306
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,839
latent risk essentially and so in order

307
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,019
to you know begin to reason about that

308
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,720
risk um and you know assess it and

309
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,519
manage it and systematically reduce it

310
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,440
over time step one is really

311
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,200
understanding what your dependencies are

312
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
um and it's it's been surprising to me

313
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,300
you know the extent to which you know

314
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,820
folks aren't always aware of what I what

315
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,860
even are all my dependencies and you do

316
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,600
have a good sense of you know the

317
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,880
inventory of the software Upstream of

318
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,279
Wii U which you rely on and it's a big

319
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,779
gap and I think you know closing that

320
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,200
Gap is is step one to you know as I say

321
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,180
beginning to quantify to reason about

322
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,339
and systematically reduce risk over time

323
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,860
you first got to make it visible and

324
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,420
step one in making it visible is really

325
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,279
understanding what your dependencies are

326
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,500
it's a very fundamental thing

327
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,940
um and it's a step that you know many

328
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,279
organizations are just beginning on um

329
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,680
but it seems absolutely vital to me

330
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,140
awesome thank you quick poll here

331
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,000
do you think you have a good grasp on

332
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,620
what your open source dependencies are

333
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,660
I think that validates very well at your

334
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,519
point um are you do you think you should

335
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,380
do

336
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,779
okay good for you and what do the rest

337
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,260
of you think

338
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,300
awesome so I'm gonna jump in here

339
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,620
because I was told controversial

340
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,839
opinions right yeah okay I'm gonna hit

341
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,459
you off so this is a security conference

342
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,920
but my and this is not representative of

343
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,899
sneak by the way I know this is recorded

344
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,600
So everyone forgive me in the future but

345
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,180
um Randall disappears

346
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,720
it's a conspiracy for sure uh but my

347
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,220
opinion so the question is like what is

348
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,420
most important that's going on that

349
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,700
people should be aware of uh I would

350
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,279
actually say maybe in as a security

351
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,899
Community we like

352
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,279
you know

353
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,100
we over Market ourselves sometimes in

354
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,040
the sense that uh myself as a developer

355
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,600
I guess what I'm trying to say is I

356
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
don't actually care about security all

357
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
that much like I like the idea of things

358
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,480
being secure and building Reliable

359
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,279
Software that's safe for people to use I

360
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,279
think that's obviously the goal but I

361
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,899
think the key part in making that happen

362
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,000
is making sure that developers are

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,940
embedded in the security life cycle and

364
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,800
finding issues really quick and fixing

365
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,899
them on their own ideally without a big

366
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,940
security team triaging and managing all

367
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,920
the risk and I think a lot of the times

368
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,100
in the security space we we like run the

369
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,740
risk of trying to convince developers to

370
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,060
care about security or trying to

371
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,519
convince people to you know put a ton of

372
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,839
time and effort into it and learn about

373
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
all these new protocols I mean you saw

374
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,320
the alphabet soup on the screen earlier

375
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,959
I think for developers it's just way too

376
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,200
much and so as a security Community my

377
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,240
thought is let's just do our best to

378
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,639
make it automatic for people let's build

379
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,740
tools that are going to be super

380
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,959
developed focused give them a really

381
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,399
nice experience so that they don't even

382
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,380
need to think about it 99 of the time

383
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,839
only when it's absolutely critical so

384
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,760
that is my controversial opinion for the

385
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,040
for the panel for right now

386
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,320
so lots of nodding hats so good friends

387
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,720
sounds like

388
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,279
is in charge of security I would love

389
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,480
that he's so great

390
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,200
maybe latching a little bit on the

391
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,860
concept of uh we don't it's important to

392
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,320
start to understand what our

393
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,660
dependencies are and what is the

394
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,820
software open source or not that we are

395
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,320
relying on when we are running our

396
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,600
applications one thing that I'm seeing

397
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,420
from my perspective uh since the offers

398
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,639
a platform that essentially covers the

399
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,639
full life cycle of

400
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,620
security for applications in Cloud

401
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,740
native environments but one thing that

402
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,279
we are noticing our users latching a lot

403
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,720
to is the idea of being able

404
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,540
to prioritize so not only to fully

405
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,120
understand what you have but also if

406
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,899
possible reduce the burden and for

407
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,899
example one way that uh we do that is by

408
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,120
leveraging a runtime information so you

409
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
know you have a thousand dependencies

410
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,720
how many of them are they actually

411
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,079
loaded in memory and people are just

412
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,579
resonated to them and they think that

413
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,000
the core reason is people a little bit

414
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,440
overwhelmed you know and uh so I think

415
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,760
as an industry

416
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,959
there must be an effort not only on

417
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,300
accuracy and precision but also in these

418
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,279
ties to the concept of let's make this

419
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,500
easy for the developers you know to

420
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,279
reduce the work reduce the burden and

421
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,560
prioritize uh if possible in a way that

422
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,839
is from one point to be effective and

423
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,040
from the other point of view less

424
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,740
stressful

425
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,899
okay

426
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,459
I don't think I'm going to be very

427
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,320
controversial because I agree with

428
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,600
everyone uh the way I've been looking at

429
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,880
a problem which kind of encompasses what

430
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,339
these other other panelists have said is

431
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,920
so it's a three-stage journey it's no

432
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,959
fix and force and this may sound

433
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,639
familiar to some of the googlers in the

434
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,380
room because it was something I helped

435
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,540
work on while I was at Google but the if

436
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,160
you're clueless on where to start on the

437
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,959
Journey of supply chain security like

438
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,639
the first stage is no you got to know

439
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,720
what you're running you got to know

440
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,220
where it came from you got to know how

441
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,680
risky that software is and then once you

442
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,540
have that information once you sort of

443
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,339
know what the heck's going on in your

444
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,019
production environments the next stage

445
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,060
is obviously you gotta fix it and

446
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,519
ideally fix it and prioritize it in a

447
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,660
way that you're getting the biggest bang

448
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,860
for your buck

449
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,320
so lots of tooling and stuff that's out

450
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,019
there now for for helping fixing things

451
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,699
and then the last stage is you got to

452
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:57,899
enforce it like throughout your

453
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,880
organization so if you've decided to

454
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,860
take a stance that you know everyone

455
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,619
must use 2fa or you must use a certain

456
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,299
technology or do things a certain way

457
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,859
then you got to make sure that that's

458
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,599
what's being complied to throughout the

459
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,660
organization so three stages no fix and

460
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,939
force and that's my where you start on

461
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,020
this journey

462
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,880
well thank you I'm going to provide if

463
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,919
not controversy at least a certain

464
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,319
question because we said well you you

465
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,140
need to be you that who is the you that

466
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,099
I think

467
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,199
Franklin Randall's you as a developer

468
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,700
that you can still talk about it but

469
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,679
like when you say you need to be aware

470
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,240
of these dependencies you need to fix a

471
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,240
force who is that person

472
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,700
it's everyone no I mean this is this is

473
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,500
maybe the where the controversy comes in

474
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,640
because

475
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,260
um yeah I see it I see it every day

476
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,120
where there's a constant tension between

477
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
the security team and the developer

478
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,200
teams and security team wants to do

479
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,760
things a certain way but the developer

480
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,260
team says no get out of our way we're

481
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,760
not using that thing we're not following

482
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
following your policy and it's this

483
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,260
constant conflict that's going on so I

484
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,840
think you know as as to Randall's Point

485
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,700
like these things sort of need to be

486
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,220
done easy and by default so you really

487
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,960
need to win over developers you need to

488
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,220
get out of their way but you need to

489
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,840
give them the tools that they need to do

490
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,120
their jobs and make it so they don't

491
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,520
have to think about these things so it's

492
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,440
it is the chain guard mission to make

493
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,360
solver security supply chain security

494
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,220
secure by default so that's something we

495
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,320
take to heart and we realize like we're

496
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,820
going to be done as a company as a

497
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,620
startup if we don't do these things that

498
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,480
are easy for developers and people to

499
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,760
adopt so I want to add one thing to what

500
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,460
Kim was just saying which is like okay

501
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,860
so what is the real key you know to like

502
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,600
getting a developer to actually like fix

503
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,640
some stuff which is really hard to do

504
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,100
like I know a lot of you everyone in

505
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,480
this room obviously cares about security

506
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,580
because you're here but one of the most

507
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,140
difficult things is getting developers

508
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,580
to care enough to actually go in and fix

509
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,020
stuff even if you have like a backlog

510
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,940
and prioritizations and all that stuff

511
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,340
right it takes time and that's usually

512
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,500
not someone's first Focus

513
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,260
so my personal opinion there's like

514
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,660
three escalating ways to like achieve

515
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,000
this like the first thing is providing

516
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,280
enough education for people so they can

517
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
Google something and like learn about it

518
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,460
and like solve the problem that's like

519
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,380
step one right and thankfully there's

520
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,820
like amazing blog posts and YouTube

521
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,740
channels and stuff that cover a majority

522
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,020
of that stuff then you have I think

523
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,460
escalating from there or like getting

524
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,100
better would be uh like gamifying the

525
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,860
experience so how do you incentivize

526
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,980
developers to make security fun and I

527
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,120
think there's a lot of ways to do that

528
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,620
maybe it's giving them points or giving

529
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,960
them prizes for fixing things

530
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,820
um this is a Shameless self-plug but we

531
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,200
actually run an event called the Big Fix

532
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,299
every year where that's basically what

533
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,039
we do we try to get developers to just

534
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,840
fix as many open source vulnerabilities

535
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,820
as possible and compete against one

536
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,980
another for prizes so that's like the

537
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,539
second thing you can do and the third

538
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,120
thing you can do is what all of us in

539
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,500
the vendor Community are always working

540
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,940
towards which is having that like

541
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,000
seamless experience of tooling that just

542
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,039
like eradicates the issue to even think

543
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,600
about in the first place which is super

544
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,220
powerful you know

545
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,919
in general I think that if there is

546
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,700
something that the modern shift left

547
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,620
security is drastically changed is the

548
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,960
relationship between the security team

549
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,580
and the developer the developers and the

550
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,100
giant increase in engagement that uh

551
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,720
that the Developers

552
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,179
have you know they are much more part of

553
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,580
the process now the question is do

554
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,820
developers like this or not

555
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,340
that's a great question though Isaac I'm

556
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,200
hoping you can also talk about customers

557
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,140
and what works well there as well and we

558
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,820
have an audience question great

559
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,679
job right and a lot of our Focus is

560
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,840
yeah it's really been sort of like just

561
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,980
just take care of the problem so

562
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,900
security doesn't have a deal

563
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,179
but security really likes visibility

564
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,640
into these processes

565
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,679
and one of the problems that Securities

566
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,840
have for a long time is a mishmash of

567
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,160
all these different tools that made

568
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,260
their lives impossible with millions and

569
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,240
millions of findings right and they came

570
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,740
up with two big Solutions one is

571
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,260
of everything

572
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,840
and the other was Baseline right we

573
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,880
can't fix everything let's focus on

574
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,799
where we're at now and getting better

575
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,480
while not making it worse

576
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,679
worse so

577
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,080
how do you think that we work better

578
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,260
with security teams in their terms and

579
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,120
not just tell them don't worry we're

580
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,460
safe I'll just repeat the question

581
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,440
because they're recording you saying

582
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,700
basically we've talked a lot about Dev

583
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,679
and Ops left security out of the

584
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,780
equation and they have two ways how can

585
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,700
we bring them more into this pattern

586
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,140
that we're talking about

587
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,640
when they're not going to look at any

588
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,280
alert right when they right they want

589
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,720
their own world the things they're used

590
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,600
to how can we plug them with them Isaac

591
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,580
so I think I mean

592
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,460
partly it's about providing

593
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,320
um a common view of a common set of

594
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,340
problems

595
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,320
um and you know one of the things I'm

596
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,059
working on at the moment you know around

597
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,919
the topic of s-bombs and so you know

598
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,140
there was an executive order 18 months

599
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,419
or so ago and what do you know um if you

600
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,440
supply software to the federal

601
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,600
government then you know starting real

602
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,059
soon in fact June um if you're on a

603
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,080
certain list

604
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,360
um you'll be required to produce s-bombs

605
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,860
to provide alongside your software to

606
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,600
federal government and so there's

607
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,640
thousands perhaps tens of thousands of

608
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,500
organizations around the country right

609
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,679
now in the US I'm getting good at you

610
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,780
know producing s-bombs and getting ready

611
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,580
to shipment to federal government and on

612
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,080
June 15th the federal government is

613
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,940
going to wake up to a quarter of a

614
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,799
million s-bombs in their inbox wondering

615
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,059
what are we going to do with these

616
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,919
things and what they're going to do with

617
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,200
them I hope um is start using tools like

618
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,299
guac and I'm really excited about guac

619
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,360
as a product being an aggregator of this

620
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,340
metadata and so if you imagine you know

621
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,740
we're going to be um you know thanks to

622
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,240
the US federal government to start

623
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,120
swimming in a sea of security metadata

624
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,700
about our dependencies and we're going

625
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,520
to be overwhelmed by data and guac as a

626
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,900
product is about how do we turn that

627
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,659
data into information and I think

628
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,340
there's a secondary question then is how

629
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,159
do you turn that information into value

630
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,780
and that's that second process is

631
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,700
audience specific there are certain

632
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,260
things that developers are going to want

633
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,900
to do with a c of s bombs like when I

634
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,539
import new dependency into my IDE I'm

635
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,799
going to want to see it pop up and

636
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,179
inform you about the risk of that

637
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,799
dependency transitively down its

638
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,860
dependency graph and so on if I'm a risk

639
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,900
assessor or a compliance expert at an

640
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,400
organization I'm going to want to take

641
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,140
that data and have tools to convert that

642
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,780
that information into value for me if

643
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,280
I'm a security professional I'm going to

644
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,440
want to look at the same view of the

645
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,720
same data but customized to me to have

646
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,580
given me value but I think it starts

647
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,340
with everybody looking at the same set

648
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,679
of data and I'm encouraged by things

649
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,440
like the executive order to um you know

650
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,659
start to force the issue to have the

651
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,000
industry and open source and you know

652
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,039
Enterprise produce more security

653
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,559
metadata about their software there are

654
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,120
these missing pieces that what do you do

655
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,580
with it then but Gathering it all in the

656
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,400
same place and so various audiences can

657
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,900
share a common view of it seems

658
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,179
absolutely key to me so can I just ask

659
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,799
Isaac before you give them the mic yeah

660
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,059
you know as you're touring around and

661
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,020
listening to people and we're talking

662
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,700
about security folks in the executive

663
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,039
order and s-bombs do you get the sense

664
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,380
that Security Professionals

665
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,980
are ready to access this bombs and this

666
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,659
new reality or it's just like another

667
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,419
thing coming their way like and we talk

668
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:37,980
a lot about it but like when it's going

669
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,360
to hit the security professional's desk

670
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,220
what are they are they ready what are

671
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,140
they going to do absolutely not

672
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,059
um and I mean I think it's it's a good

673
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,860
point and there's a lot of Focus right

674
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,600
now when people talk about s-bombs in

675
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,340
the executive order and you hear it at

676
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,140
this conference as well there's a lot of

677
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,120
focus on how do we generate s forms what

678
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,039
are the tools we use to generate s-bombs

679
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,080
that's only a part of the problem what

680
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,520
do you do when you do wake up to a

681
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,260
quarter of a million s-bombs I think

682
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,880
something that's interesting about the

683
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,159
the s-bomb Journey of the industry is on

684
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,520
at the moment is it's the very beginning

685
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,320
s-bomb is the beginning of end-to-end

686
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
instrumentation of a supply chain once

687
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,760
you've built the bus to transport

688
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,100
s-bombs from here to there there's all

689
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,419
kinds of things you're going to want to

690
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:19,799
put on that bus as well you're going to

691
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,360
want to put salsa Providence on that bus

692
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,340
you want to put open ssf scorecard

693
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,960
information on that bus you want to put

694
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,179
open source you know Project Life Cycle

695
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,760
events on that bus but as bombs is

696
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,100
forcing the creation of a metadata

697
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,779
transport layer throughout the supply

698
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,360
chain and it is absolutely the very very

699
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,460
beginning and I think add to your point

700
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,980
there is a massive tools Gap around at

701
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,900
the moment around how do we process and

702
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,720
reason about this supply chain metadata

703
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,360
we're about to drown in it um I don't

704
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,860
have a great answer apart from pointing

705
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,940
to

706
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,640
your point there is an enormous tooling

707
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
Gap at the moment

708
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,480
um and I think it's it's an opportunity

709
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,299
um as well as a challenge thanks I'd

710
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,860
like to keep keep on this question of

711
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,419
like the security professional where

712
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,700
they mesh in with the the operator and

713
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,900
the dev

714
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,480
and kind of what you see work already so

715
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,980
I don't know if anyone that panel can

716
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,539
talk from customers and what they see in

717
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,580
the world uh okay I'll add one other

718
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,220
thing sorry uh I love this topic because

719
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,500
like whenever people talk about a lot of

720
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,120
tools and Security Professionals wanting

721
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,380
that visibility and measuring everything

722
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,059
differently like what a success is it

723
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,740
Baseline here this or that or

724
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,120
reachability or whatever the discussion

725
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,520
is like my instinct always is like we

726
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,779
should just build another tool to

727
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,640
centralize all the tools and then like

728
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,020
you know that's that's always the

729
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,760
solution but then it's always just like

730
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,919
another thing you know

731
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,080
and there's the way I like to think

732
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,460
about it is there's like States you know

733
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,500
there's like the perfect state

734
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,299
and then there's like the current state

735
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,100
which might be terrible some places are

736
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,539
really good at other places then there's

737
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,700
like the in-between which in my mind is

738
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,679
like the sweet spot like it you don't

739
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,559
necessarily have to be perfect and have

740
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,659
a single you know security operations

741
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,580
center that Aggregates everything and

742
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,260
perfectly classifies and prioritizes

743
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,260
everything all the time you know one day

744
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm sure that's going to be the the

745
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,620
standard for everyone but today like

746
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,299
it's just not really feasible there's

747
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,580
just too much going on so

748
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,860
and again this is not the sneak official

749
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,200
opinion but my personal opinion is

750
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,120
what you want to do is just like build a

751
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,059
culture of like action you know so

752
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,799
whatever your security team is doing if

753
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,840
they're measuring via just how many net

754
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,960
vulnerabilities do we have uh or

755
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,760
whatever whatever thing they're looking

756
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,799
at that's totally fine you just want to

757
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,440
build a culture where the security team

758
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,840
is assisting and empowering the

759
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,279
developers and operations people and

760
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,140
everyone else to just go in and fix

761
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,179
stuff without a lot of process and the

762
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,740
less process you have the easier it's

763
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,940
going to be for people to like get

764
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,440
excited about it to actually do

765
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,940
something to make a difference so just

766
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,740
basically like just Nike like just do it

767
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,600
and then other than that like it'll sort

768
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,779
of sort itself out in the long run

769
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,419
it's a social problem you're saying

770
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,760
well is that a social problem as much as

771
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,980
a tools problem it's yeah like an

772
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,179
everything problem

773
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,200
S no and that's why in my opinion uh

774
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,059
especially you know going back to the

775
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,520
question how do we make the different

776
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,480
personas talk better and that would

777
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,740
generate the right data that can be

778
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,220
consumed by by multiple teams

779
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,799
um I think it starts from standards

780
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,860
rather than writing more software and

781
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,600
that's why for example this conferences

782
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,419
is really important you know and the

783
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,580
word that the cncf is doing in you know

784
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,220
in a way that is biased toward building

785
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,640
tools you know and uh having these

786
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,980
stores becoming like a way for people to

787
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,559
interoperate stuff like oppa style stuff

788
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:47,039
like you know Common formats for s-bombs

789
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,980
stuff like the Falco language

790
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,500
these These are the only way in the

791
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,200
future that that we have to sort of

792
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,320
agree on a common language that then we

793
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,779
can all use and I think that visibility

794
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,880
comes from there I think that the

795
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,940
communication and in the correct sharing

796
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,679
information then comes from that and uh

797
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,360
that's why I believe and since they

798
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,340
believe that the future of security is

799
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,100
open exactly for this reason

800
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,080
I agree too and that was kind of my

801
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,880
answer to your question like all these

802
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,320
tools and stuff they need to be rooted

803
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,480
in open source standards and all the

804
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,980
solutions and I hope you know most

805
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,600
vendors are looking that way too like

806
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,399
that's what's gonna kind of connect us

807
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,140
all together and all this security stuff

808
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,940
it's an open source problem like we're

809
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,919
not going to get away from not using

810
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,480
open source code so I think the

811
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,720
solutions need to be rooted there too

812
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,279
so in some ways security is one of those

813
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,260
fields where standardization is coming a

814
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,399
little late too you know a lot of

815
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,799
computing we've had that wave already so

816
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,260
you're seeing that as a powerful force

817
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,059
security and JavaScript are the two

818
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,740
lagging communities basically that's

819
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,299
what we're hearing

820
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,620
webassembly will solve everything

821
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,020
Randall it's a question Paul let me take

822
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,460
the mic can I borrow your microphone too

823
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,340
we've got time for one question I think

824
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,020
hi

825
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,960
um this is a quick follow-up to Laurie's

826
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Point regarding

827
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,740
enforcing standards and

828
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,720
potential security and the developer

829
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,480
like is that an example like how how

830
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,340
would you enforce that through some kind

831
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,679
of technical products or some kind of

832
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,820
process

833
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,580
uh to ensure that standards is being

834
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,460
applied like uniformly across the the

835
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,899
Enterprise for example

836
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,360
yeah I mean going back to the Oppa

837
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,399
example for example oppa is you know

838
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,340
like a CNC project in in so it's it's

839
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,100
very relevant here but I think that you

840
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,760
know

841
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,700
as a concept uh oppa the open open

842
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,279
policy language is pretty simple you

843
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,740
know let's just Define a domain-specific

844
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,039
language to Define policies but it it

845
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,960
had and it's having a profound impact on

846
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,640
the community because for the first time

847
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,220
this is sort of a lingua Franca that can

848
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,840
be used interchangeably uh by different

849
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,940
teams inside the single organization but

850
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,460
also across organizations to Define

851
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,620
anything that is a policy and that

852
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,899
includes security but it goes actually

853
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,240
Beyond security so

854
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,539
um there are other examples but I think

855
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,460
that there's a huge difference between

856
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,200
approaching things like that and

857
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,039
throwing the data in the custom format

858
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,159
of a Sim vendor you know then of course

859
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,320
the data is locked in there and you

860
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,000
cannot really do a lot out of it even if

861
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,460
you have apis and so on so something

862
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,559
that is driven by the community agreed

863
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,000
uh

864
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
upon by different groups of people and

865
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,559
then use as a standard to do multiple

866
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,539
things then just enables you know this

867
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,120
kind this kind of cooperation in

868
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,460
collaboration

869
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,039
I mean I would Echo that and I think you

870
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,720
know one of the interesting things I've

871
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,240
seen from where I'm sitting at Google is

872
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,760
there are really three flavors of supply

873
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,140
chain security at Google there's the

874
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,179
same set of problems across three what

875
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,860
I've been calling delivery domains and

876
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,659
delivery then domain number one is is

877
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,399
open source how do we make open source

878
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,140
more secure by default how do we look at

879
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,820
you know supply chain concerns and open

880
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,159
source flavor number two at Google is

881
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,080
Google's first party supply chain our

882
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,640
internal build system Source control

883
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,140
policies

884
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,260
um you know binary provenance and you

885
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,240
know inventory and so on how do we think

886
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,919
about Google's first party supply chain

887
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,320
and then the third flavor is products

888
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,820
that Google is building to help its

889
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,320
customers with their supply chains and

890
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,840
so products shipping through gcp and

891
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,940
looking at these three different domains

892
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,340
what's really interesting is that the

893
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,200
problems that are the same the supply

894
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,360
chain security Primitives and problems

895
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,399
are essentially similar but what's very

896
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,440
different is the economics in each space

897
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,200
and the set of incentives and the actors

898
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,200
and the way that you know value Flows In

899
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,539
These spaces and that means that the way

900
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,940
that we need to solve these problems is

901
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,620
characteristically different across

902
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,880
these three different domains things

903
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,260
which are going to work for Google in

904
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,720
terms of its first party policy things

905
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,059
like executive mandates exist barely at

906
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,320
Google but they do

907
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,520
um you know where you have top down

908
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,899
control and say we're going to do things

909
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,120
this way that's not an approach you can

910
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,159
use in open source and so different

911
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,559
techniques are needed to solve these

912
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,179
these same set of problems in these

913
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,519
different domains but what's common is

914
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,919
Open Standards open Frameworks open

915
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,980
tools and you know a common vocabulary

916
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,799
which can be shared and so I just Echo

917
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,360
Laurie's point though actually there's a

918
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,679
lot of power because this

919
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,320
standardization can cross these domains

920
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,120
which are characteristically different

921
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,279
in rather interesting ways

922
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,559
thank you so it's great to end on this

923
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,419
note of how important basically the

924
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,940
topic of the conference is here today I

925
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,620
asked the panel to quickly finish off

926
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,320
I'm going to ask them to tell us what

927
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,919
the most overhyped uh technology acronym

928
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,620
thing and their their field is and what

929
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,940
they think is receiving too less of

930
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,340
attention so deliver just again on the

931
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,740
top of the panel what to look at what to

932
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,200
be a little suspect of Kim are you ready

933
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,839
to go oh man this is going to be quite a

934
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,760
hot take because I live and breed this

935
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,619
but I honestly think software supply

936
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,639
chain security that word is so over

937
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,879
hyped right now and it's really hard to

938
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,859
um to weed through the noise and

939
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,199
understand what's going on I think to

940
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,780
round all this out together I think you

941
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,080
know the the the people that are

942
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,820
claiming to do stuff in the space and

943
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,159
everyone like a lot of it is again

944
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,020
rooted back to open source so I would

945
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,500
make sure that you know whoever whoever

946
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,080
it is is investing in open source as

947
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,580
they should because this is a open

948
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,219
source problem above anything else

949
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,020
um and kind of understand like what's

950
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,520
what's actually happening under the

951
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,199
covers there but it could be because

952
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,580
I've been living and breathing the term

953
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,379
for several years now that it's like

954
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,320
everywhere it's insane

955
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,380
awesome thank you larvis

956
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,040
um

957
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,859
I operate quite a bit especially in the

958
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,960
open source community in the area of

959
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,599
runtime security and my controversial

960
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,700
take on something that is overhyped is

961
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,260
ebpf

962
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,480
uh

963
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,200
[Music]

964
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,660
[Laughter]

965
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,960
I think that uh

966
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,880
I mean I find it personally

967
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,400
controversial because I personally have

968
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,660
invested a lot of time on this

969
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,540
technology and my company as well but it

970
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,720
feels like now everybody's just jumping

971
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,000
on the acronym bandwagon without even

972
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,359
fully understanding what dppf is you

973
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,380
know how many people have heard the BPF

974
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,540
how many people

975
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,000
think they understand exactly what eppf

976
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,200
does

977
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,200
exceed if I was going to pick on you who

978
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,020
would still keep their hand up right so

979
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,660
uh and and that is detrimental to the

980
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,099
whole Community because then it feels

981
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,960
like you know a vendor that uses ebpf

982
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,000
they just have a great solution you know

983
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,040
while in practice it's a platform you

984
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,900
know it's sort of a mini Computing

985
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,520
platform in the kernel of the operating

986
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,780
system and you can use it to do

987
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,760
magnificence and stuff and stuff that is

988
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,400
completely useless so that's my that's

989
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,460
my one thanks Randall so everyone's just

990
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,760
saying their own company is over

991
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,380
pretty much yeah yeah like everyone's

992
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,000
just calling themselves I was going to

993
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,920
say cves but I didn't want us to get in

994
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,140
a fight

995
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,060
you know whatever all right so I was

996
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,920
gonna actually crowdsourced mine I asked

997
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,119
a bunch of colleagues and friends like

998
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,260
what they thought about this question

999
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,400
because I thought was really interesting

1000
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,220
and the one that I resonated with the

1001
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,380
most is a very particular type of supply

1002
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,780
chain Attack Just typo squatted packages

1003
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,359
because typo squatting is something you

1004
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,220
see a lot in the like Tech press like in

1005
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,839
security news like you know someone

1006
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,880
created a version of a popular library

1007
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,400
with one letter difference and there's a

1008
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,780
lot of like

1009
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,579
PR that goes into that however in

1010
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,619
reality those things rarely get used by

1011
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,599
developers like single digit numbers

1012
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,660
across the board and the the things that

1013
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,700
are under hyped are that there's a ton

1014
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,680
of Open Source projects that have a lot

1015
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,020
of utilization and usage that have a ton

1016
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,119
of known CVS in them and like known

1017
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,680
problems that are just like not

1018
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,680
remediated yet and so I think that's a

1019
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,640
really big opportunity for like

1020
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,440
literally all of us in this room maybe

1021
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,180
after we all just like whip out our

1022
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,220
laptops and just go fix send one pull

1023
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,260
request to fix one of those and that

1024
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,000
would make a bigger impact than like all

1025
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
the type of squatted stuff since the

1026
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,180
beginning of time times like a thousand

1027
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,780
you know awesome thank you hi sir

1028
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,599
um so as someone who spends um a lot of

1029
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,380
time at the moment thinking about

1030
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,660
s-bombs I think s-bombs are over hyped

1031
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,300
um that's not because I don't love s

1032
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,099
bombs I do love s-bombs I think they're

1033
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,660
awesome and at the same time I think

1034
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,820
they're over hyped I think what's

1035
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,260
there's a there's a misunderstanding I

1036
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,880
think that you know I think uh you know

1037
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,920
you came and a colleague of hers had

1038
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,599
coined us you know the sbns bomb doesn't

1039
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,220
stand for silver bullets which I really

1040
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,320
love um but there's you know there is

1041
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,000
this perception that gosh s-bombs are

1042
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,680
going to get us there this is finally

1043
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,060
going to do it for the uh for the

1044
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,920
security of everything and they're truly

1045
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,380
not um but I think that you know if you

1046
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,119
are required to live the s-bomb

1047
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,339
lifestyle you will be forced to adopt a

1048
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,720
whole number of different practices

1049
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,540
which themselves will increase and and

1050
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,820
better your security posture and if you

1051
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,160
look at the executive order the policy

1052
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,440
goal of the executive order is not a c

1053
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,720
of s bombs it's not even s-bombs the

1054
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,359
policy goal of the executive order is

1055
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,920
better security and they're pushing

1056
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,079
s-bombs because it's a vehicle to begin

1057
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,300
this journey with and so I think looking

1058
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,520
at them in in that way I think there's

1059
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,900
there's a ton of value there that's

1060
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,400
super important I'm really excited the

1061
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,380
industry is working on it at the same

1062
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,420
time if there's an expectation that gosh

1063
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,480
if we just do s-bombs we'll all be okay

1064
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,260
absolutely not

1065
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,400
awesome

1066
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,560
well thank you so much panel for being

1067
