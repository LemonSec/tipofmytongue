1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
hi everyone good morning Welcome to our

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,700
talk on standardization and security my

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,799
name is Vinnie Carpenter and I am the

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,599
vice president of engineering at a

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,519
company called Northwestern Mutual I

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,559
lead the cloud and devops organization

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,139
at Northwestern Mutual I'm honored to be

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,359
joined by my colleague Ravi davidini who

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,560
is the senior director of engineering

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,260
and it leads our devops Engineering

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,140
Group and by the way I totally feel over

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,100
addressed I should have listened to

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,099
Robbie but you know I didn't and but I'm

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,920
going to persevere through so

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,020
so Jenny we're going to tell you this

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,660
story uh of the journey we're on of

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,340
standardization simplification and how

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,140
that Journey has led to improvements in

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,540
our overall security posture but before

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,980
we dive into the meat of the topic I

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,480
just wanted to spend 30 seconds to tell

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,680
you a little bit about our company just

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,420
to sort of do some context and level

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,460
setting so we're a fortune 90 company

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,280
that strives to be at the center of our

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,539
customers Financial life we do

27
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,059
investment Insurance advisory Services

28
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,739
planning

29
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,399
um

30
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,020
our goal is to provide Financial

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,539
Security for our clients we have about 5

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,540
million clients and a revenue of about

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,939
34 million dollars annually we're a

34
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,580
privately held 165 year old company

35
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,260
right so that's the key part 100 we've

36
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,180
been around for 165 years as you can

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,460
imagine that means a lot so just putting

38
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,920
that out there but we're lucky to be

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
privately held with great financial

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,939
strength I think we're the only two

41
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,640
companies that have a AAA credit rating

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
from Moody's and these rating agencies I

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,939
believe Microsoft may be the other one

44
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,579
so uh on the agenda today we're going to

45
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,259
start by talking about and discussing

46
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,640
sort of the what I think is a seminal

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
work of uh Barry Schwartz who is an

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,100
American psychologist author

49
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,479
um I was going to talk about it a little

50
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,560
bit

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
um and uh Barry talks about this notion

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,299
of paradox of choice

53
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,579
so then we'll dig into our experiences

54
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,439
with sort of unlimited Choice unlimited

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,200
flexibility uh and then sort of pivot

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,840
into how standardization has helped us

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,180
simplify and more importantly secure our

58
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,399
environment

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,380
as part of this we'll talk about the the

60
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,360
cultural implications of standardization

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,599
and what that means for us and share

62
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,860
some of the outcomes and the lessons

63
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,540
we've learned as we embarked on this

64
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,379
journey

65
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,500
so without further Ado Robbie take it

66
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,620
away

67
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,340
thanks Winnie

68
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,260
um hey guys I'd like to introduce this

69
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,360
concept called Paradox of choice right

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,640
as Vinnie mentioned there's a lot of

71
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,140
these ideas are borrowed from this book

72
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,120
by Barry Schwartz we highly recommend

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,879
this book

74
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,160
so the first and the most common example

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
of paradox of choice is found at a

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,060
grocery store right there's a there's a

77
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,580
Target nearby I think it's this way try

78
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,379
walking into any aisle right you will

79
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,959
see 14 varieties of Cheerios 23

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,780
varieties of olive oil 40 varieties of

81
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,239
toothpaste 15 varieties of bottled water

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,900
right 55 varieties of shampoo if all of

83
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,519
this is giving you a headache don't

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,379
worry there is 80 different varieties of

85
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,180
pain relievers in the over-the-counter

86
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,019
medicinal with Aspirin acetaminophen

87
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,280
ibuprofen in the form of capsules

88
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,540
liquids tablets you name it that's a lot

89
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,300
next example is TV right because in

90
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,640
America we spend most of our time doing

91
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,580
two things watching TV and shopping

92
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,800
number of TV channels you get from cable

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
TV is 1761.

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,599
and let's look at some of the streaming

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,780
services right Netflix has over 4 000

96
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,819
titles available Prime Video has even

97
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,000
more millions of hours of content just

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,220
just scratching the surface right and

99
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,620
many choices in the providers uh way too

100
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,000
many shows and way too many movies

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,640
available this is practically true for

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,260
everything we see in real life right

103
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,180
choice is a luxury

104
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,640
more than more number of choices is

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
considered as a symbol of privilege too

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,659
much choice is essentially the current

107
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,060
reality of our society

108
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,280
but wait isn't that a good thing having

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,860
a number of options will help us choose

110
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,019
what's good for us right not really

111
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,480
according to the research uh look at the

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,900
graph here right like you will see

113
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,360
as the number of choices

114
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
are small the satisfaction is low right

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,339
but as the choices increase the

116
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,320
satisfaction increases but

117
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,600
more the number of choices as the

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,820
choices keep increasing people tend to

119
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,220
feel more pressure confusion and

120
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,900
potentially dissatisfaction with your

121
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
choice this can then lead to anxiety in

122
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,060
decision analysis paralysis and

123
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,520
dissatisfaction right there are several

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,139
names for this same phenomena it's

125
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,600
called fear of missing out fomo right

126
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,880
and law of diminishing returns whatever

127
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,220
you want to call it this is a quite this

128
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,680
is quite real

129
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,139
there's another more scientific angle to

130
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,479
this too right there is this research by

131
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,880
American Psychological Association it's

132
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,580
very official it says that the more

133
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,100
decisions an individual makes in a short

134
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,620
period of time the more each decision

135
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,320
decreases in quality it creates what is

136
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,840
called a decision fatigue right because

137
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,820
we have a finite amount of energy to

138
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,360
exert the more energy we use for trivial

139
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,520
everyday decisions the less energy we

140
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,460
have for critical ones Steve Jobs right

141
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,620
he used to wear the same kind of dress

142
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,540
every day every single day black

143
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,820
turtleneck and jeans and that's all you

144
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,860
ever saw him in and everywhere he went

145
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,500
he was like that President Obama used to

146
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,039
wear wears blue and blue or gray suits

147
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,240
and that's the statement he made in an

148
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,220
interview with Vanity Fair he talks

149
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,840
about pairing down trivial decisions

150
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,340
because he has a lot of other decisions

151
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,620
to make there are many people who eat

152
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,960
the same kind of breakfast every single

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
day including Obama five eggs and a

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,580
toast every single day right now the

155
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,740
paper talks about multiple ways in which

156
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,960
we can fight decision fatigue right but

157
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,400
we don't need to go into that this is

158
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,100
not a psychology conference instead we

159
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,320
will talk about how this idea applies to

160
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,560
us in the cloud native world

161
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,539
so this is a quick look at the tool

162
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,759
landscape right this is just a small

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,740
sampling of a plethora of tools

164
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,139
available in the market we've tried to

165
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,940
organize this into logical categories

166
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,740
right all of these logical categories

167
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,139
are high level steps in the software

168
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,759
development life cycle

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,580
at each of these stages you will see how

170
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,560
many options we have that provide a

171
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,360
similar capability right for example

172
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,620
source code we have GitHub gitlab

173
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,139
bitbucket code commit from AWS all of

174
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,819
these tools provide a way of Version

175
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:33,960
Control

176
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,819
similarly with coding right there are

177
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,380
hundreds of programming languages

178
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,240
available and I only listed a few here

179
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,580
I'm not talking about all of the options

180
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,199
available in the market right I'm

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,780
talking about how companies typically

182
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,600
end up with multiple tools that they

183
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,220
actually use for the same capability

184
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,580
right for example a company may have

185
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,800
gitlab possibly some GitHub an older

186
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,380
version of SVN

187
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,940
and maybe an maybe a Version Control for

188
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,680
Mainframe as well that's like four

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,780
different tools for the same capability

190
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,859
called Version Control

191
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,819
um but the question is why do we end up

192
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,800
with so many tools right there are two

193
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,360
main reasons for this

194
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,060
technology Evolution a company like ours

195
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,220
Northwestern Mutual we have been doing

196
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,039
technology since the 1960s Winnie

197
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,660
um and we're big on experimentation too

198
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,880
and we have experimented quite a lot

199
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,979
with technologies that were invoke at

200
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,780
the time and that footprint of the

201
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,060
technology never actually goes away and

202
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,160
then you try something new and and some

203
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,780
of the some of the teams adopt it so it

204
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,139
creates a tools for all basically next

205
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,060
is what I call as technology Islands

206
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,740
right this is basically also called The

207
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,539
Shadow I.T if a company is sufficiently

208
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,979
big

209
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,259
there's a lot of Technology teams that

210
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,479
are spread over several departments

211
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,860
right and these teams tend to create

212
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,860
their own set of tools and hence these

213
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,539
islands are created with very little

214
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,240
communication between these islands so

215
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,400
Shadow ID is also created sometimes when

216
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
when a team decides that they're going

217
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,520
to do something of their own because

218
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,259
just to work efficiently right because

219
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,639
everything else is slow we want to do

220
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,960
our own thing

221
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,300
um so what happens right when if we have

222
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,580
so many options in the tooling

223
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,460
first is high cost of Maintenance you're

224
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,979
probably paying multiple licenses for

225
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,900
the same capability right or you

226
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,900
probably logged in with multiple vendors

227
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,180
the automation that you create is

228
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,340
reusable only within your technology

229
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,919
Island and not broadly so your

230
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,440
technology islands are creating these

231
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,479
islands of automation right

232
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,520
too many tools and hence the complexity

233
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,880
is high and you're creating standards if

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
you want to create standards that apply

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,120
to the whole Enterprise that becomes a

236
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,140
challenge

237
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,600
tools for all leads to data sprawl to

238
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
your data is all over the place hence

239
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,260
capturing metrics that measure your

240
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,459
success that becomes a challenge

241
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,800
security is a challenge obviously this

242
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,019
is a security conference and with so

243
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,760
many Tools in our supply chain our

244
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,459
attack surface is really high supply

245
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,680
chain attacks are one of the most common

246
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,480
ways in which attacks are happening

247
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,100
these days it has if you look at the

248
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,860
stats two years ago to now it's like it

249
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,920
has risen by 430 percent

250
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,180
um and you need to be constantly

251
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,279
patching all of these tools too right

252
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,899
this adds to the cost as well and

253
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,480
obviously the results in a lot of loss

254
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,800
productivity

255
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,380
all of these tools mean that your skills

256
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,959
are siled your team members can change

257
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,640
from one team to another team very

258
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,080
easily and when he's going to touch upon

259
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
that concept a little bit more later on

260
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,540
so what do we do

261
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,640
so what I've described so far is is like

262
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,860
a buffet right what we say with the

263
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,200
buffet is here's all the things that you

264
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,540
want to eat and go make your own plate

265
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,120
right when we do that every plate is

266
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
different from every other plate right

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,980
very few people think about nourishment

268
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,260
and health when there's a buffet like

269
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,120
people want to eat I would load up on

270
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,100
dessert and and then there's a lot of

271
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,260
wastage too with too many tools that's

272
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,240
exactly what we're doing right we're

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,519
seeing here's all the tools and go

274
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,920
create your own applications what we

275
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,560
want to say instead is we will provide a

276
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,440
set menu limited options but good

277
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,399
options

278
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,339
we think about health and nourishment we

279
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,620
vet and select these tools very

280
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,839
carefully very intentionally and we want

281
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,519
to streamline our process we want to

282
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,860
streamline our tools we say that we want

283
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,839
to improve efficiency and free up

284
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,720
resources uh to invest in things that

285
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,279
are actually differentiators for our

286
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,899
business right because

287
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,899
four tools for for Source control is not

288
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,600
going to add business value right

289
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
basically a purposeful evolution of

290
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,779
technology is what I'm talking about we

291
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,660
say we want to create a golden path a

292
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,180
paved Road a standard approach for

293
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,579
creating applications right with all the

294
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,860
standards and all the guardrails built

295
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,019
into this paved Road and all you have to

296
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,060
do as an application developer is to

297
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,800
drive on that paved road so an

298
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,180
application development team basically

299
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,220
doesn't think about

300
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,920
how to actually

301
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,779
deploy their application or or what

302
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,000
Supply chains supply chain tools to use

303
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
or what CI CD security guardrails they

304
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,140
should use all they do is develop and

305
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,600
deploy their application

306
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,160
this is an example of what a

307
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,899
standardized platform might look like

308
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,760
right you can see this is very different

309
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
from the other diagram very limited

310
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,540
number of tools right and these are

311
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,519
standardized across the Enterprise this

312
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
is our set menu if you need to write

313
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,920
code you use GitHub and maybe a small

314
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,779
number of approved programming languages

315
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,959
that's it one tool to do your builds one

316
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,300
place to store artifacts and one tool to

317
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,640
orchestrate your deployments one tool

318
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
for infrastructure as code maybe a

319
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
couple of monitoring tools right

320
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,760
intentionally standardizing your tools

321
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,160
landscape now compare that with this

322
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,260
right this is the buffet

323
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,420
this is definitely much cleaner

324
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,339
now once we standardize on the tools

325
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,920
right we want to create a single way in

326
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,260
which application can be deployed all

327
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,640
the way to production

328
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,180
all the steps for example that a change

329
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,459
needs to go through from commit all the

330
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,279
way to production that's your pipeline

331
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,200
right like we want to standardize that

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,779
pipeline one pipeline to rule it all

333
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,820
right this basically provides a

334
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,560
standardized build

335
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,220
scanning testing artifact storage and

336
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,779
signature and all the way to the

337
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,399
deployment as well if you do this right

338
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,500
a lot of different development standards

339
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,079
can be enforced things such as code

340
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,060
reviews

341
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,980
artifact security if you if you're an

342
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,600
application developer you don't need to

343
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,100
think about how to deploy your

344
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,959
application right or what security steps

345
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,820
you need to take you just write code you

346
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,740
just write your unit tests and

347
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,120
everything else is ready to go that's

348
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,060
your paved Road you're just driving I

349
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,279
often think of developers as Cooks right

350
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,220
they're good at making a meal not

351
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,839
necessarily good at taking that meal to

352
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,339
the customer's table that needs to be

353
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,260
somebody else's job

354
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,720
so if one of the examples we talked

355
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,500
about

356
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,579
we said we want to use only a few

357
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,620
programming languages right so what

358
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,120
happens if someone just ignores this

359
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,339
mandate and chooses to use a programming

360
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,220
language that's more modern and more fun

361
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,740
right what can we really do so what I've

362
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,480
showed you before is a carrot carrot

363
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,519
approach right what we're saying is if

364
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,260
you want to deploy faster

365
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,660
and in a more secure way right use our

366
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,820
standardized pipeline that's a carrot

367
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,920
you you want to start off this process

368
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,440
by offering carrots right but only

369
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,480
carrots and no sticks it's not going to

370
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,000
work we we need both we need to enforce

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
certain standards standards such as code

372
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,380
reviews or or the fact that you need to

373
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,820
create a change ticket for every

374
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,459
production change or security scanning

375
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,440
in your pipeline even things such as

376
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,420
setting limits on how much Cloud spend

377
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,040
you want to have your you want to have

378
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,380
in your organization or how much CPU

379
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,880
limits you want your applications to use

380
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,680
right pretty much anything your

381
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,079
organization wants we need to be able to

382
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,820
enforce it and this is the key to

383
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,980
success sticks are as important as

384
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,399
carrots

385
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,380
I can see some of you are frowning

386
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,760
um this sounds like way too much

387
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,480
policing and less freedom and stopping

388
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
everything cutting down everything

389
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,500
there's obviously a lot of cultural and

390
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,120
organizational implications to this

391
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,920
whole idea when he's going to touch upon

392
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,779
a few of those

393
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,740
thanks Ravi

394
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,139
so I think Ravi essentially laid out the

395
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,420
case where unlimited choice and

396
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,160
unlimited flexibility isn't really what

397
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,959
it's cracked up to be I think having

398
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,519
unlimited choice at least it's been our

399
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,220
observation leads to cognitive load

400
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,740
anxiety and I think really thinking

401
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,940
about like the broader picture of the

402
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,820
Enterprise it leads to variability and a

403
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,260
complexity in the environment right

404
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,360
decision fatigue as Robbie described as

405
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,920
a real thing I worked at organizations

406
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,079
where developers had unlimited Freedom

407
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,120
right so you could you could write and

408
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,820
go or rust or Java or JavaScript or

409
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,040
python you could pick uh you know the

410
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
you know spring or spring boot if you

411
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,060
wanted to or you could make your own I

412
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,000
mean unlimited choice you know led to

413
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,260
you know when new Engineers would start

414
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,820
on the team essentially decision fatigue

415
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,380
they're like how do I get started like

416
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,720
what's the standard way that I can do it

417
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,519
what's the majority of developers in

418
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,860
this organization doing so that if I

419
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,760
need help

420
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,459
there's somebody I could go to and so I

421
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,320
think the decision fatigue is a real

422
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,940
thing and so

423
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,480
um

424
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,420
in fact briefly about sort of um the

425
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,800
process we followed on choosing the

426
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,940
right tool and I'm going to start with

427
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,040
this quote from Alan Kate if you're not

428
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,500
familiar with Alan K Allen was a

429
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,199
um computer scientist at Xerox Park in

430
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,880
the early day where I think literally

431
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,860
everything that we use today in

432
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,899
computers came from Xerox

433
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,459
um including the mouse and graphical

434
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,019
user interface and all of that right and

435
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,339
he's a Pioneer in the world of

436
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,260
object-oriented programming and at this

437
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,079
I just love this quote as quotas uh is

438
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,699
very famously quoted saying simple

439
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,139
things should be simple and complex

440
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,820
things should be possible

441
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,579
and I think that idea sort of enforces

442
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,339
our approach when we're picking tools

443
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:03,839
um you know Robbie talked about you know

444
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,940
we don't want to pick a tool because

445
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,800
it's new it's shiny and it has all these

446
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,360
things so it when you're going through

447
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
this tool selection process you know

448
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,260
think about the end goal at mine have

449
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,940
you you know looked at the pros and cons

450
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,620
of this tool have you thought about how

451
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,899
this is going to integrate uh into your

452
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,180
environment Ravi described earlier the

453
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,399
sort of perfect world we have this

454
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,380
notion we internally call our ideal

455
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,660
Pipeline and so what we give our

456
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,760
developers is the ability to write code

457
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,339
in a prescribed number of languages and

458
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,139
Frameworks all they have to do is they

459
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,120
commit their code to gitlab and then

460
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,339
magic happens the pipeline kicks in so

461
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,500
whether it's container scanning so we

462
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,940
use systic for container scanning right

463
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,380
all of that's done for you vulnerability

464
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,579
checking

465
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,199
um you know coding standards checking

466
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,540
automated testing automatic artifact

467
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,579
checking automate automated deployments

468
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,440
to production automated Canadian like

469
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,240
all of that is built into the pipelines

470
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,579
and so it simplifies the role of the

471
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,320
develop developer so that he or she is

472
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,660
just focused on writing code and doesn't

473
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,220
have to worry about

474
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,600
how is this going to code get to

475
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,699
production you know he described the the

476
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,079
chef making the meal and then somebody

477
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,059
else taking it to the table the

478
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,679
engineers are focused on just writing

479
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,079
code and not having to worry about all

480
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,179
of the things that go around making this

481
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,599
you know building it testing it securely

482
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,119
you know checking it into an artifact

483
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,439
Repository

484
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,880
making sure it goes through the right

485
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,619
kubernetes environment making sure it

486
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,720
has the right scaling parameters making

487
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,520
sure cost is managed all of that stuff

488
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,220
is done for you so that you know you can

489
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,380
end up in a world where you're just

490
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,200
focused on code

491
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,059
you know one of the things Robbie and I

492
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,799
were talking about as we're kind of

493
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,419
discussing this presentation in this

494
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,059
slide specifically I I

495
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,220
um I recall going to a presentation I

496
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,780
think it was 2015 the CTO of etsy uh

497
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,120
presented I think it was in 2015

498
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,400
um and uh this the title of the topic

499
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,140
was very provocative he said the title

500
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,360
of the talk was use boring technology

501
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,419
and it's a phenomenal it really is a

502
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,620
phenomenal talk if you get a chance

503
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,020
Google used boring Technologies and

504
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,580
please do it after the stock don't do it

505
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,400
now but uh but really the premise of his

506
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,559
thing was you know sometimes we're all

507
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,480
attracted to try the new and shiny

508
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,860
things and we want to do that right we

509
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,299
want to experiment we want to allow

510
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,160
people opportunities to try new things

511
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,980
build new things but you know the the

512
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,020
premise that he's making is if you're

513
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,299
using Java and spring boot for example

514
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,120
if you're using JavaScript and node you

515
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,940
know or react or Python and flask like

516
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,280
these Tech Stacks are being used by

517
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,620
millions of organizations across the

518
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,840
globe tens of millions of developers

519
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,700
have sort of battle tested these Tech

520
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,100
Stacks in every single scenario that you

521
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,840
can think about so there's not a use

522
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,860
case that you're going to come up with

523
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,720
that somebody hasn't already

524
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,000
gone to production with and so all of

525
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,460
the issues all of the potential known

526
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,620
issues are known either result or

527
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,299
documented so that you're literally

528
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,740
standing on the shoulder of giants

529
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,539
because they've done the validation for

530
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,179
you you know maybe you start with the

531
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,400
rust and this is a bad example Russ is

532
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,600
an awesome programming language but I'm

533
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,919
just going to say rust is a relatively

534
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,780
newer languages so all of the issues

535
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,240
maybe not known right so if you're going

536
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,799
to production with a rust application

537
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,720
you might be discovering things that

538
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,039
maybe somebody else hasn't discovered

539
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,140
yet right so this notion is

540
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,020
you know focus on business outcomes and

541
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,700
not really on undifferentiated

542
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,380
technology choices right technology

543
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,179
schools we're all engineers and I think

544
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,520
you know technology is is

545
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,419
um is critical but you know focusing on

546
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,919
undifferentiated technology like you

547
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,000
know if you already have a source

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,620
control management system you don't need

549
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,419
another one unless it does magic for you

550
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,940
right unless it has chat GPT built into

551
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,200
it it just writes your code for you

552
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,760
right maybe that is worth migrating to

553
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,360
so

554
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,080
so

555
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,700
um talk a little bit about this notion

556
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,740
of tools consolidation

557
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,539
um you know as we pivot to kind of focus

558
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,299
on business outcomes rather than

559
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,380
undifferentiated technology choices I

560
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,700
think the path becomes clear right

561
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,039
because you have a vision in mind of how

562
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,720
we want to get there and as you embark

563
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,280
on this journey

564
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,200
um you know we went on a journey we used

565
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
to have GitHub Enterprise as our source

566
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,280
control management system it did

567
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
everything all of our pipelines ran in

568
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
there and we migrated to gitlab and you

569
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
know it's you just have to know it's a

570
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,299
multi-year journey

571
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:19,679
um and

572
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,280
um

573
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,960
you know as you're doing this migration

574
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,640
it can't be a big Bank thing right you

575
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,960
have to figure out a way to do this

576
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,700
where you're offering incremental value

577
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,740
so that you don't have this we're going

578
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,179
to go do this we'll see you two years

579
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,440
later and there'll be this new shiny

580
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,419
thing in two years because technology

581
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,100
will change the business will change the

582
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,780
organization will change the needs will

583
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,460
change and so

584
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,740
um you know these things have

585
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,039
um a long life but you have to provide

586
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,480
incremental value

587
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,820
um as you go on this journey

588
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,020
um

589
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,880
the other thing obviously you know

590
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,200
pretty obvious like you want to do it in

591
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,340
a way that you're not disrupting the

592
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,840
business because obviously that's the

593
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,820
most critical thing data migration is is

594
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,740
pretty critical right like

595
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,720
um again I'm gonna beat to death this

596
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
example of moving from GitHub to gitlab

597
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,679
as an example right like the commit

598
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,240
history is merge requests or pull

599
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,340
requests and comments and like all of

600
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,200
that stuff issues like have to come

601
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,940
along so that the new system essentially

602
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,400
has all of the data that the old system

603
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,100
has so you could safely go and say I'm

604
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,679
on system B I can cleanly turn off

605
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,559
system a retire the hardware that was

606
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,299
running on and not have to pay for

607
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,100
licenses right because what we've

608
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,159
observed being 164 year old company is

609
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,299
you know I think we bought our first

610
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,580
Mainframe in 1950

611
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,340
um in the late 50s I believe and like a

612
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,460
lot of the technology like unless you

613
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,120
aggressively investing in

614
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,580
decommissioning all technology there'll

615
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,740
be a facet where you migrate 80 of it

616
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,140
and there's 20 just stays around and

617
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,520
then now you're responsible for care and

618
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,320
feeding of it securing it make making

619
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,559
sure it's not vulnerable so

620
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,220
the last note is as you pick new tools

621
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,100
you know training on engineers and

622
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,940
training Engineers on the new

623
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,480
capabilities uh becomes critical so

624
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,080
um

625
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
one of the things that comes up often

626
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,919
when we talk about standardization right

627
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,780
we talk about standardization governance

628
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,460
like they all sound like developers

629
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,799
instantly revolt and go oh what do you

630
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,120
mean like you know you hired me because

631
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,679
I'm an awesome developer and I just want

632
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,780
to write code and so this question

633
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,480
always comes up is is standardization

634
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,480
detrimental to Innovation right

635
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,000
I think the answer is no right

636
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,460
you can innovate

637
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,200
um

638
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
and live in an environment where you

639
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,220
have standards right like you think

640
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,299
about technology distance I've been

641
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,679
doing this for almost 30 years and think

642
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,120
about every single technology decision

643
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,980
as a set of trade-offs right you start

644
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,919
you on a path forward you typically want

645
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,360
to have a bias of action you don't want

646
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,940
to spend weeks months and years spending

647
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,940
uh time just doing analysis paralysis So

648
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,140
based on the information that you have

649
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,000
you've got to move forward but you need

650
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,320
to be able to Pivot as more information

651
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,940
becomes available you sort of change

652
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,000
your path

653
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,840
historically you know a lot of the

654
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,539
organizations I worked at we've given

655
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,760
our teams a lot of decision making at

656
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,940
the local level and I'm a describe

657
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,380
myself as a recovering software engineer

658
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,480
I did I wrote software for 20 years and

659
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,000
as a geek like software Engineers love

660
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,919
building stuff right and I I know I've

661
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,600
done this in my career where you know

662
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,039
you're building a new application and

663
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,200
there's like this is great five like

664
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,179
five to six great caching libraries that

665
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,500
are in open source that are used

666
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,720
everywhere and you're like yeah but I

667
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,159
could just write my own and so you do

668
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,480
because

669
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,340
you know that's what developers do right

670
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,480
and so

671
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,200
um

672
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,840
I think it's crucial to know what's

673
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,340
worth building and what just as a

674
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,620
commodity right this is not to suggest

675
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,299
that we shouldn't let people experiment

676
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,039
we want to encourage people to

677
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,360
experiment we want people to try new

678
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,340
things we want people to build like we

679
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,799
encourage people to write software at

680
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,240
Northwestern Mutual we encourage people

681
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,740
to open source stuff and build

682
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,900
communities uh participate in open

683
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,700
source project you know give back to

684
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,679
that right not to suggest all of that

685
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,260
but like Focus those energies on things

686
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,059
that differentiate your business right

687
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,280
Focus don't focus on commodity like

688
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,140
building another casting framework

689
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,059
you're not going to make anything better

690
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,400
than redis or memcache or the the sort

691
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,559
of leaders that exist in that space is

692
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,080
it a good thought exercise great do that

693
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,179
you know you know in your 20 time if you

694
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,000
want to just to learn and grow but think

695
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,860
about like building things that are

696
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,480
differentiating and not sort of

697
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
Commodities and the last thing that I

698
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,780
think is really important and every

699
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,940
organization has organization has to

700
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,440
arrive at it

701
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
um based on how they work but it's the

702
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,940
incentive model what is the incentive

703
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,700
model at your organization I worked at

704
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,860
places where if you open source

705
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,080
something and you got a bunch of you

706
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,960
know stars on GitHub like that was

707
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,340
celebrated because it's like hey you've

708
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,140
done a phenomenal thing and it is a good

709
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,299
thing right like we want more of that

710
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,760
again I I keep repeating myself because

711
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,740
I'm not you know I want to make sure we

712
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,600
should encourage people to contribute to

713
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,120
open source we want to keep doing that

714
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,780
um

715
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,340
but if that's the only thing you

716
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,080
celebrate that's the incentive model

717
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,280
you're studying for the organization

718
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,860
that hey if you do something cool you'll

719
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,900
get accolades if you do your job and do

720
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,240
an awesome uh delivery on a project and

721
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,740
have phenomenal business outcomes well

722
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,760
that's great but like we want to

723
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,080
celebrate that publicly right so you

724
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,940
have to have this in central model where

725
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,860
you celebrate both things you celebrate

726
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,480
people doing really cool and Innovative

727
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,000
things but you better also celebrate

728
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,919
phenomenal business outcomes because

729
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,500
that's really why we're here right to

730
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,260
build and deploy and secure our

731
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,820
businesses so

732
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,020
um

733
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,539
uh talk briefly about outcomes um I know

734
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,559
we're a little over time I'm going to

735
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,700
speed through some of these things so

736
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,919
just uh a couple of quick items

737
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,659
centralized governance I think we talked

738
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,500
about

739
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,179
um is possible I think Ravi described

740
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,980
the you know I think we call it the one

741
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,220
pipeline to rule them all is like we

742
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,140
encourage our application teams to use

743
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,480
uh kind of the centralized pipeline so

744
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,520
all of the things that need to happen

745
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,580
whether it's built in a certain way code

746
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,580
quality scanning you know check marks

747
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,260
for vulnerability scanning you know

748
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,279
systic for container scanning x-ray for

749
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,539
you know open source vulnerabilities

750
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,679
like

751
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,260
um you know Bill material like being

752
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,940
building a builder material like all of

753
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,559
the things that you can think about and

754
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,039
future needs as our security team you

755
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,480
know thinks about more things to do to

756
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,220
secure our environment could be built

757
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,020
into that Pipeline and the developers

758
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,220
don't need to change anything because

759
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,600
they're just Levering a standardized

760
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,220
Pipeline and they're getting the

761
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,740
benefits of all of that

762
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,960
I think one of the other benefits that I

763
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,940
briefly want to touch on uh before I

764
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,340
turn it back over to Ravi is this notion

765
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,880
of standardization right if

766
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,640
if all of the engineers on your team are

767
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,740
working in a similar way using similar

768
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,659
programming languages and tools using

769
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,940
similar Frameworks and and processes

770
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,900
it's easy to essentially

771
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,760
swarm Engineers through the biggest

772
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,679
opportunity right at Northwestern

773
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,820
Michigan we talk about this notion of

774
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,799
fungibility right like

775
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,520
um

776
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,400
like if we have 50 engineers and you

777
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,080
know they're in like they're across

778
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,460
let's say six or eight different teams

779
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,080
and they all work differently and use

780
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,520
different programming languages and use

781
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,960
different ways to sort of get code into

782
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,820
production if we had a new business

783
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,960
initiative that was going to be

784
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,640
transformational and we wanted to put

785
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,500
all those Engineers on it there's a lot

786
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,840
of ramp up time to say like okay what

787
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,159
are we doing like are we building in

788
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,380
rust or go or JavaScript or python or

789
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,440
Java okay let's pick one or maybe we

790
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,760
just build apis and it doesn't matter

791
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,320
what we build in but there's a lot of

792
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,120
sort of organizational structure and

793
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,919
friction that comes into play but if

794
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,419
you're all sort of building in a similar

795
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,100
way leveraging the standard pipelines

796
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,419
the standard tool deploying in a

797
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,679
standard way with the standard set of

798
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,960
security controls it's a lot easier for

799
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,059
us to come together and make that next

800
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,220
business initiative successful

801
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,500
so Robbie I'm going to turn it over to

802
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,880
you talk about some lessons learned

803
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
thanks honey

804
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
um so in all of these there were a few

805
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,080
key lessons that we have learned I'm

806
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,360
going to try to sum it up quickly

807
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
um first single Source control is an

808
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,559
absolute must right if you have multiple

809
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,320
SCM systems your code is fragmented some

810
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,120
source code is living in one place

811
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,039
another source code is living in another

812
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,080
place your developer permissions are

813
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,580
fragmented as a result right like some

814
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,340
developers have access to some repos and

815
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,840
other developers have access to other

816
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,940
repos that affects your developer

817
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,220
collaboration if for example a developer

818
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,679
creates a common library that could be

819
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,380
reused across all of your software

820
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,779
which of the four tools would you put

821
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,159
that in right like how would you make

822
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,500
sure that is not being duplicated not to

823
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,940
mention the high cost of Maintenance

824
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,520
double licensing cost quadruple

825
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
licensing cost probably it's a nightmare

826
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,779
so you if you don't have a single SCM

827
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,179
system please fix that first like one

828
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,340
sem for your entire organization is a

829
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,720
must

830
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,480
now we talk about devops as a culture

831
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,640
and not a role right but every

832
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,440
application team is a devops if you

833
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,960
think about the idea of devops team

834
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,120
a devops team is an application team

835
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,220
that is cross-functional right which

836
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,260
means that team does everything that an

837
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,419
application needs and every skill that

838
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,820
the application needs to be deployed to

839
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,980
production is within the team but we

840
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,299
don't want to end up with a set with

841
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,640
several applications optimizing their

842
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,799
application teams optimizing their

843
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,960
process locally right because more often

844
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,120
than not local optimization leads to

845
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,240
Global degradation a team that takes a

846
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,220
global view of things right of the

847
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,220
entire process of all the automation of

848
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,740
the common libraries right creating an

849
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,659
overall vision for your company and

850
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,399
centralized metrics and centralized

851
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,500
governance all of this is essential

852
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,000
right like you can call it a centralized

853
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,279
devops team you can call it a tools team

854
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,720
call it a platform engineering team

855
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,700
whatever the name is right but such a

856
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,659
team is essential

857
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,620
um next we need to talk about this idea

858
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,380
of picking the tools with end in mind

859
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,299
right and we have we have to understand

860
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,679
that

861
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,200
When selecting a tool we don't need the

862
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,140
best tool in the market we need a tool

863
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,299
that fits the business needs right if a

864
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,940
tool is pretty good that's and it fits

865
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,559
all your requirements that's all you

866
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,080
need right and choosing one tool that is

867
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,940
pretty good is much better than having

868
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,399
multiple amazing tools that do the same

869
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,659
thing in your environment right

870
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,539
consistency in the environment is that

871
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,340
it leads to far better outcomes than

872
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,159
having multiple custom Solutions and

873
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,500
finally we talk about standardization

874
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,659
and governance and security it could be

875
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,460
considered as boring and too much

876
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,799
policing but it doesn't have to be right

877
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,440
it can be made fun when we can Implement

878
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,440
a lot of gamification techniques and and

879
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,360
build excitement and make it fun right

880
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,640
this idea of gamification exists

881
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,380
everywhere in the real world loyalty

882
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,320
programs and badges of achievement and

883
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,779
reward points and all the big companies

884
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,820
do this like a leaderboard for example

885
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,200
right if you're if you want if you if

886
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,179
you want your teams to reduce security

887
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:52,500
vulnerabilities

888
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,600
create a leaderboard that ranks the

889
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,039
teams that reduce the most

890
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,899
vulnerabilities and reward them every

891
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,399
quarter or if you want to evangelize

892
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,740
certain devops practices right measure

893
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,020
those and and create incentives that

894
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,360
reward people for such behaviors goes

895
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,559
back to the point that Winnie was making

896
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,899
about incentives aligning to your

897
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,059
business outcomes and this is a great

898
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,980
way of making standardization and

899
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,980
security super fun

900
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,380
that's all we have thank you folks for

901
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,840
coming and I want to thank cncf also for

902
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,399
giving us an opportunity to come here

903
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,380
and present some of our ideas

904
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,260
you can see the QR code I can scan it if

905
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,120
you want to send us any feedback but

906
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,139
please let's have some questions

907
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,940
right

908
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,320
to take time

909
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,480
process that you allow them

910
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,140
yeah

911
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,240
yeah so the question was we couldn't

912
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,700
hear it is uh let's see your Enterprise

913
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,500
standard is C plus plus and a developer

914
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,059
comes up and says hey I've been learning

915
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,620
rust and it's a phenomenal language and

916
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,179
I'd love to sort of start doing work in

917
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,279
that and incorporate that maybe into our

918
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,260
standards so great question so we

919
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,820
actually have a formal process right

920
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,340
because as I said every technology

921
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,080
decision that you make even standards

922
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
that you make are based on the stuff the

923
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,440
information that you have at hand the

924
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,539
needs at that time needs evolved things

925
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,220
change technology changes right so we

926
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,200
actually have a process so all of our

927
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,220
standards were considered them

928
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,320
essentially living document so we have a

929
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,700
process we have a centralized

930
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,679
architecture team where you can come in

931
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,140
and say like hey here's why I think rust

932
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,000
should be an approved standard language

933
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,120
and walk through the pros and cons of it

934
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,919
um and and

935
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,840
um essentially the formalized process

936
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,279
we'll we'll take that into account

937
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,320
figure out the value proposition and if

938
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,760
it makes sense actually make it a

939
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,220
standard so we absolutely have that kind

940
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,140
of process where our standards evolve

941
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,659
and we you know very into essentially

942
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:06,779
want people essentially to submit uh you

943
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,340
know emerge requests essentially is what

944
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,500
we say to our standards because

945
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,659
standards can't live you know in a

946
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,279
vacuum they have to be kind of living

947
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,899
breathing documents so we absolutely do

948
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:16,620
that

949
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,600
just to add to that for every business

950
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,460
process right if there's a rule there

951
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,380
needs to be an exception and in this

952
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,940
climate where your technology is

953
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,279
evolving constantly you cannot be

954
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,320
married to a rigid process and say that

955
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,700
everything is fine right your process

956
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,100
needs to be flexible as needed yeah so

957
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,600
we all we definitely love and exception

958
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,860
process yeah

959
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,479
there's a question in the back yeah

960
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,299
yeah

961
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,799
um so do you want to talk about Dora

962
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,720
okay dude yeah um if you look at the

963
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,940
Dora metrics right there is lead time to

964
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,039
change and number of change deployments

965
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,200
per you know whatever quarter and we

966
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,960
need to restore all of these four

967
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,960
metrics are defined basically looking at

968
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,120
speed and stability right and there's a

969
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,440
lot of if you look at the book on

970
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,659
accelerate Nicole forskin and Jess

971
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,359
humble right they talk about several

972
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,379
behaviors that actually lead to uh such

973
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,520
outcomes right these are business

974
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,899
outcomes but a lot of different

975
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,879
behaviors actually contribute to that

976
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,560
behavior there's like 24 behaviors that

977
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,300
are listed in that book and

978
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,980
collaboration is definitely one of them

979
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,918
how your people collaborate how closely

980
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,899
interactive they are

981
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,760
um reducing the silos and being able to

982
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,918
release if I want to do a release to

983
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,960
production I don't need to talk to a

984
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,399
separate team right I don't need to ask

985
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,960
their permission my team needs to be

986
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,379
flexible enough um you know or have we

987
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:44,879
need to have the right set of tools that

988
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,980
so we can release the application

989
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,560
production so definitely if you look at

990
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,899
Dora metrics they they provide a lot of

991
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,339
business outcomes and you're actually

992
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,739
measuring business value also along with

993
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:59,779
a variety of other behaviors

994
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,700
thank you great question any other

995
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,000
questions

996
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,540
all right well thank you so much

997
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,060
appreciate you spending the last half an

998
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,500
hour with us thank you again if you get

999
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,740
a chance please send us some feedback

1000
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,520
thank you
