what's up everybody my name is Michaela

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,620
flateau unicorn collector with defense

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,500
unicorns hi and I'm calling andreaki I'm

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,019
a cyber defense uh Mission manager at

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,360
defense unicorns thanks for choosing to

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,480
spend this time with us and also for the

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,800
five of you that connected to our

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,359
pineapple Wi-Fi

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,300
no I'm just kidding she was a joke just

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,220
make it your world it's right before

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,080
lunch so we really do appreciate you all

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,519
coming in

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,140
um and hopefully you're here to learn

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,660
about cyber security education if not

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,159
we're going to be closing the door soon

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
so we're sorry you're stuck with us

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
until we're going to be locked and

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,480
they're getting out now

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,640
but uh we're gonna go ahead and start

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,879
with a quick video on a growing attack

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,360
trend

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,479
all right so this new trend uh

23
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,600
my corgis uh definitely try to to fish

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,880
me out of my chewy credential logins

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,360
chat GPT is uh changing the game it's

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,220
lowering the barriers for cyber attacks

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,200
to the point that my Corey almost

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,040
succeeded I almost fell for it

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,399
but uh I uh I'm curious uh when you

30
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,560
think about some of the strategies that

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,720
you all use when you go to look to see

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,939
if you're getting fished

33
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,520
um think about some of those strategies

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,459
for me personally some of the quick got

35
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,580
checks that I do right is there are

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,560
things felt wrong or is there bad

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,739
grammar uh you know capitalization and

38
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,080
weird spots right those are like the

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,080
quick go-to's typicals right

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
um as you can see in in this email right

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,620
that was sent to me uh those don't work

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
and it took a little bit more effort for

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,660
me to realize like this may not be a

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,319
legitimate email so with that in mind it

45
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,720
got me kind of thinking like dang if

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,599
they can do that with chat GPT what can

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,940
they do with fishing and schmiching

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,739
right like when I get that phone call

49
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,080
are they going to have a better script

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,680
than they used to with text messages

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,060
sometimes those can be harder if they

52
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,319
get more advanced with their text

53
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,360
messages am I going to be able to tell

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
if it's actually like my bank talking to

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,780
me or is it right it's going to get a

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,239
little bit harder and finally is the

57
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,060
social engineering aspect uh

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,360
they get you where it hurts they do and

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,940
so with Technologies like chat gbt and

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,500
things like that it gets a little bit

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,379
harder to think all right uh I love my

62
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,239
Corgi he got me where it hurt right

63
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,159
taking care of him giving him his treats

64
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,220
uh but Michaela they're going to begin

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,900
calling you about things other than your

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,780
extended car warranty so things that I

67
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,280
actually care about it's that social

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,099
engineering and adding that emotional

69
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,560
portion to it to hit you where you know

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,060
you start to think maybe I should click

71
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,680
on this because

72
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,299
so

73
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,519
all of this example really to just kind

74
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,680
of hit home Technologies are lowering

75
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,360
the barriers for cyber attacks it's

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,819
changing very rapidly it's really quick

77
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,700
on how these things are changing and

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,700
it's expensive to keep up right so it

79
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,440
kind of leads us to the first part of

80
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,159
our title the pretty penny right cyber

81
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,920
security or just cyber in general is its

82
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,760
own economy in its of itself

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,360
you have a Cyber attack and you've read

84
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,819
the headlines right yeah it can cost in

85
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,680
the millions more and more expensive it

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,720
is getting more and more expensive to

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,579
the point that a research group felt

88
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,160
that they had enough evidence to write a

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,960
report going ahead and saying that if

90
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
you take all the cyber security damages

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,460
and you put them together that that

92
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,680
amount is actually comparable to Global

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,500
economies and it would rank third uh

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,919
that's crazy this talk luckily is not to

95
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,500
nitpick the validity of how they came up

96
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,360
with their numbers or things of that but

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,160
just taking the quick acknowledgment

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,020
that somebody felt that they had enough

99
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,419
evidence to make that claim is kind of

100
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,699
scary in and of itself

101
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,680
um normally when you get attacked and

102
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,660
things like that you kind of think what

103
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,220
about insurance right there are

104
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,380
insurances for cyber security attacks

105
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,540
that is becoming an area where some

106
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,180
insurance companies are thinking I don't

107
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,220
know if I'm I'm crunching the numbers

108
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,259
and they're not in my favor it's very

109
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,660
unstable I'm not sure that there's going

110
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,400
to continue to be insurance for cyber

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,720
attacks

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,540
um that's kind of scary on the flip side

113
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,520
of the economy where there maybe isn't

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
as much reporting as kind of the idea

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,720
and the drive of well why are these

116
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,000
cyber attacks still happening there is a

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
whole nother side of the market on you

118
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,259
know like a black market if you will of

119
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,160
selling of malware zero days access

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,479
stolen credentials are really hot right

121
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,560
now

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,220
um

123
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,900
and so they're selling these things

124
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,259
actually on my way here Michaela you

125
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,960
said you're a recruiter I'm sorry uh

126
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
they're cutting into your talent pool I

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,180
saw an article I didn't go in and

128
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,919
reading it as much as I should have but

129
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,780
it was stating that cyber criminals are

130
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,440
recruiting six-figure jobs PTO

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
oh oh you know so I didn't read it so I

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
don't know if there's like health

133
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,460
benefits or you know 401K Investments

134
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,820
but uh the point is the pretty Penny's

135
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,800
not going anywhere cyber attacks aren't

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,479
going anywhere

137
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,979
um and it's kind of scary if the

138
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,960
insurance is begin pulling away from

139
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,660
that area well then the ownership really

140
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,479
becomes on all of us and on our

141
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,940
companies uh to how are you going to

142
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,100
prevent cyber attacks and that's why we

143
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,440
continue to cease cyber education to be

144
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,419
such an important part and an important

145
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,000
topic to share like what we're seeing

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,280
works and what doesn't work

147
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,460
um and then as you the challenge is kind

148
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,860
of daunting right the scope of how

149
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,780
quickly it's changing how much

150
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,780
technology there is how many topics

151
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,259
there are that's a lot uh so what we

152
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,520
would really like to spend most of our

153
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,520
talk staying uh with you all today is to

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,100
kind of talk about what we truly believe

155
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,919
was going to help you manage cyber uh

156
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,479
security education and that's

157
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,880
integrating it into your workplace

158
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,220
culture

159
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,600
so

160
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,699
how do you integrate cyber security into

161
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,440
your culture I feel like that's easier

162
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
said than done a lot of people think

163
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,319
that culture is kind of like a fluffy

164
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,699
thing but it actually takes a lot of

165
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,680
work

166
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,180
one of the biggest things the most

167
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,220
important thing in my opinion is making

168
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,199
your culture a safe place to admit

169
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,900
mistakes I know I don't know about y'all

170
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,080
but I know that if I thought my job was

171
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,720
on the line AKA you know the way I make

172
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,819
money aka the way I put food on the

173
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,340
table I'm not going to go forward and

174
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,759
say oh I clicked on that link or yeah I

175
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,099
I sent I sent gift cards to that text

176
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,319
message and I shared my password here

177
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,639
there I'm not going to do it because I'm

178
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,259
like I'm not going to put myself at risk

179
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,300
and ruin this opportunity for myself so

180
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,520
I'm gonna zip it

181
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
what would make me more comfortable with

182
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,099
admitting to that mistake is having

183
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,680
psychological safety are you guys all

184
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,240
familiar with that term I'm not going to

185
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,039
do the whole like raise your hands if

186
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
you feel familiar with that term if

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,400
you're not familiar with that term

188
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
though

189
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
basically it means that you are

190
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,340
providing an environment that makes

191
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,080
people feel safe

192
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,740
and they're not going to be humiliated

193
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,440
and they're not going to be punished for

194
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,539
sharing ideas admitting mistakes

195
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,000
bringing up concerns or anything of that

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,680
nature so

197
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
there is there is something that's very

198
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,940
important to distinguish though is that

199
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,740
are people genuinely making mistakes

200
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,000
versus

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,419
you know there's a genuine their lack of

202
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,520
understanding they're not following

203
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,559
policies and procedures and it is truly

204
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
on them so

205
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,420
before we show you some good examples

206
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,100
that Colin and I put together of

207
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,380
strategies on how to integrate cyber

208
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,480
security into your culture I do want to

209
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,140
touch on what I consider a bad example

210
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,440
Okay so

211
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,580
cyber security should matter to everyone

212
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,500
it does not matter if you are a

213
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,779
secretary or a cyber analyst or the CEO

214
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,180
if you're touching Tech then it matters

215
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,880
to you and I believe that this training

216
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,519
didn't really do a good job of making

217
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,100
people care enough to you know really

218
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,720
invest time and energy into

219
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,220
understanding it

220
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,800
uh I don't know how many of you have

221
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,660
been integrated in the Department of

222
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,519
Defense in any way but if you have then

223
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,459
you have been subject to this god-awful

224
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,380
training called Department of Defense

225
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,779
cyber awareness challenge it was so bad

226
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,360
that PewDiePie made a video of it and if

227
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,560
you want to subject yourself to that

228
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,480
torture you can go on YouTube and look

229
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,959
it up and myself and all the comments on

230
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,779
that video agree that some of the ways

231
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,959
that this training went wrong was that

232
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,480
it wasn't it was a yearly requirement

233
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,279
meaning that people were not thinking

234
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,320
about this until they the dreaded

235
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
training came up and they you know

236
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
clicked through it as fast as they

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
possibly could because they didn't care

238
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,080
they just wanted to get it done and get

239
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,580
it out of the way

240
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,240
um

241
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,300
I know since then the dod has updated

242
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,480
their training but for years for years

243
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,360
the training was always the same even

244
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,700
though cyber and these types of attacks

245
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,860
were evolving they were still teaching

246
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,140
us like hey if Tina comes to you with

247
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,760
this floppy disk and says put it into

248
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
your computer and you're supposed to say

249
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,200
no that's a bad idea you're like okay

250
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
that's a little bit outdated

251
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,880
um

252
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,459
the point I want to touch on with this

253
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,800
slide is the things that went wrong were

254
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,320
that it was not frequent

255
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,600
it wasn't ingrained in Daily habits it

256
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
was turned into this you know I don't

257
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,860
want to say torture device but people

258
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,600
just hated doing it

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,740
they weren't thinking about it

260
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,980
frequently and something was that when

261
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,720
you got that email saying you're due for

262
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,579
your training there's a punishment

263
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,860
attached if you don't do this training

264
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,019
you are going to lose your access and

265
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,100
you're not going to be able to do your

266
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,820
job

267
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,140
because we're cutting your access to

268
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,480
your computer done

269
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,360
when you associate a punishment with the

270
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,339
training you're automatically making it

271
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,860
not a safe environment and you're not

272
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,940
making it fun or easily digestible or

273
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,779
anything like that

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,279
and obviously I mean I feel bad saying

275
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,899
this because clearly we're using a

276
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,480
PowerPoint here but any trainings that

277
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,820
are Death by PowerPoint

278
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
just don't hit the mark they just don't

279
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,740
so I do want to transition to a strategy

280
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,680
that we believe works

281
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,640
um

282
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,940
man what am I saying here

283
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,459
strategy one

284
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,560
encourage open sharing so something we

285
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,980
do at defense unicorns is that most of

286
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,240
our communication is in slack so let's

287
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,519
integrate incident reporting into slack

288
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,560
that's where everyone is anyways it's

289
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,339
easy to access it's open and when people

290
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,680
report incidents

291
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,100
it's openly shared to all of us this

292
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,600
example right here

293
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,279
might be our record holder for the

294
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,160
quickest Audrey has only been here for

295
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,320
two weeks she's a new employee she

296
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,800
barely started and she already received

297
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,360
the text message from our CEO Rob saying

298
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
Audrey available

299
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,839
and this happens so frequently to us

300
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,360
that we consider it kind of a rite of

301
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,920
passage once you get the text message

302
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,959
you're you are now an official employee

303
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,779
of Defense unicorns but

304
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,500
we we are consistently updating that

305
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,800
thread every day of hey I got this text

306
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,980
message I received this email so Audrey

307
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,940
was able to identify that and

308
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,639
obviously avoid it because she knew that

309
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,500
it was not legitimate

310
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,620
now imagine you have a new employee who

311
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,320
doesn't have access to this information

312
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,940
and they get that text message and

313
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,839
they're sitting there thinking

314
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,820
themselves oh crap

315
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,040
the CEO is reaching out to me like I I

316
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,420
just started I don't want to mess up

317
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,880
this opportunity I should respond

318
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,459
and then bam of course we joke about it

319
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,800
because it typically follows up with a

320
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,560
I'm stuck in a conference room and I

321
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,240
need you to go to the store and buy me a

322
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,220
bunch of gift cards because that makes

323
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,899
sense right because it totally makes

324
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,500
sense but clearly you can see that open

325
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,959
sharing putting it in a forum where we

326
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,120
all regularly access it and kind of

327
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,820
turning it into a humorous situation

328
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,880
everybody feels comfortable posting in

329
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,139
there everybody feels comfortable

330
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,880
reporting and honestly there have been

331
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,100
times where people have posted and said

332
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,040
hey is this suspect and people will look

333
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,360
at it and be like actually no that's

334
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,519
that's legitimate you can click on it

335
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,839
all good

336
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,880
so good and bad examples are both in

337
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,139
there

338
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,339
now

339
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,260
we like to joke and have a lot of fun

340
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,680
but in some scenarios

341
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,779
it calls for a more serious tone

342
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,760
especially when there's been a bigger

343
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,860
breach so

344
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,320
next slide

345
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,100
um

346
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,279
leadership setting the tone and leading

347
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,540
by example

348
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,720
is huge in creating this culture and if

349
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,339
leadership is not bought into this and

350
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,440
they don't follow it it's the culture is

351
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,060
not going to survive that integrating

352
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,740
that cyber security into the culture is

353
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,600
not going to work

354
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,420
so leadership setting the tone I have

355
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,040
two examples

356
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,220
from back in the day previous workplaces

357
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,959
I won't name but

358
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,899
one bad example and one good example bad

359
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,959
example being there was a breach

360
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,019
handled behind closed doors swept under

361
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,779
the rug leadership was not transparent

362
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,720
about it and then when employees finally

363
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,240
did find out about it they were like

364
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,260
well

365
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,540
nobody told me how can I trust my

366
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,040
leadership when they're keeping these

367
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,420
things from us especially when it's

368
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,680
leaking

369
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,380
our personal data

370
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,100
so so wait you're saying that you found

371
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,199
out and it wasn't even anyone in your

372
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,600
company that told you all it was in the

373
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,760
news it was in the News That's How

374
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,639
employees found out about it

375
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,079
that's not a good feeling when you

376
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,160
figure out something about your company

377
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,279
through the news whereas a good example

378
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,639
from prior work experiences is

379
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,980
same scenario breach happened and

380
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,320
Leadership was upfront about it they

381
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,000
immediately came forward they owned it

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,880
they said we made a mistake here

383
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,240
we are owning it and here is what we're

384
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,420
doing to fix this problem and here are

385
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,320
paid paid resources to help you mitigate

386
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,560
any risk associated with what happened

387
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,540
another important part of the good

388
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,000
example is is that there's a two-way

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
street on communication meaning

390
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
leadership didn't just go up there and

391
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,860
say we made a mistake okay now nobody

392
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,420
asked any questions about it like we're

393
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,040
not going to

394
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,920
um you know respond there was

395
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,079
employees could ask whatever they needed

396
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,519
to to feel comfortable with the

397
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,199
situation that happened

398
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,120
now I I thought that was an amazing

399
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,980
response they were transparent they were

400
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,440
upfront they provided Solutions there

401
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,440
was no scapegoat like oh unnamed

402
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
employee did it I mean we're solving it

403
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
but pointing fingers no no pointing

404
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,820
fingers let's just get to solutioning

405
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,440
because that's what's most important

406
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,740
right

407
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,699
um so wrapping it up going to takeaways

408
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,800
these are the biggest things that we

409
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,040
hope that you learn from our session is

410
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,980
that number one cyber security should

411
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,380
matter to everybody and what is really

412
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,079
important about that is making sure that

413
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,000
you're putting it into a format that

414
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,579
everybody can understand

415
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:02,820
easy easy access to reporting easy

416
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,339
access to show what has been reported so

417
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,099
people know what examples to look for so

418
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,140
that if it happens to them

419
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,699
they already know

420
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,740
and um

421
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,900
you know that yearly requirement that

422
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,959
yearly reminder no it just doesn't work

423
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,179
we want cyber security to be so

424
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,160
ingrained in your culture that it's it's

425
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,660
not a second thought it's like looking

426
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,880
both ways to cross the street people

427
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,400
automatically know when I get that text

428
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
message or when I get an email

429
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,940
I'm going to screenshot it I'm gonna go

430
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,559
drop it in the slack Channel and then

431
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,380
within 10 minutes unicorns are going to

432
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,900
answer my question and say yeah that

433
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,720
that don't answer that or they're going

434
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,700
to say no that's a legitimate one and

435
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,039
you're good to go proceed

436
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,000
um

437
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,280
keeping it simple too if you put too

438
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,600
many barriers in that procedure to

439
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,220
report it makes people not want to do it

440
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,120
because they're like God I don't have

441
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,000
time for that I don't have time to do

442
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
all those steps so I'm just going to let

443
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
this simmer and then a week later

444
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,220
they're gonna forget and then

445
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,380
you know it goes from there

446
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,440
second step I feel like it just honestly

447
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,400
just

448
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,500
incorporated into what I was just saying

449
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,940
I feel like I didn't do a good job of

450
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,340
like separating those two that open

451
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,220
sharing is so important and everybody

452
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,100
needs to be on the same page whether

453
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,320
whatever role you play in the company if

454
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,940
you're touching Tech it matters to you

455
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,080
too

456
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,059
and then the last one

457
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,740
and honestly one of the most important

458
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,960
ones is that leadership needs needs

459
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,700
needs needs to

460
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,520
be there and it applies to them too they

461
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,880
admit mistakes they own it they report

462
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,280
and that provides a safe environment for

463
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,900
employees to do the same because they

464
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,880
realize they're not going to be

465
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,240
humiliated or you know something

466
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,059
happened to their job because of it

467
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,640
yeah and it's important to to know

468
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
because some of these things you may be

469
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,640
sitting and thinking like if I were

470
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,440
sitting there I'd be like well I'm not a

471
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
leader so I guess like you know I'm not

472
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,220
the CEO or I'm not the CTO right you

473
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,000
know fancy C and then letters right uh

474
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,919
so like some of these don't apply to me

475
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,799
but that's that's not the case

476
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,880
um

477
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,740
right that it should matter to everybody

478
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,600
because we're all touching things but

479
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,039
you have a personal investment right

480
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,679
because if they're going through you uh

481
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,900
you know your own personal dad is

482
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,580
important as well right some of the

483
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,140
breaches that Michaela talked about

484
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,960
right that's your data identity theft

485
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,780
does affect us all

486
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,480
um and so right we're all touching uh

487
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,580
technology but the encouraging open

488
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,480
sharing can be as simple as even if you

489
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
don't have a slack Channel or you're

490
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,660
you're a much larger organization it

491
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,580
could be as simple as asking your your

492
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,240
teammate hey uh I got this message did

493
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,160
did you get one too or do you know if

494
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,480
this is something like is this

495
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,580
legitimate or not it can be as simple as

496
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,860
having those conversations like Michaela

497
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,140
said we want it to be second nature the

498
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,059
reflux of crossing the street you don't

499
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,100
even think about it it's just a simple

500
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,200
double check that you do right you can

501
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,400
do that today uh you know no extra

502
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,799
effort really when you do things like

503
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,740
that but by doing that it spreads right

504
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,840
that idea that it spreads and you can

505
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,700
begin talking about it well if you're

506
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,620
talking about it chances are then other

507
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,120
people are going to be feeling okay that

508
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,679
they can come and they can begin asking

509
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,080
those questions it's like well you know

510
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,059
uh Michaela's super smart on these

511
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,280
things and if Michaela's asking it like

512
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,460
shoot I can ask it right like but that's

513
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,900
how it starts it's just little simple

514
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,480
things like that that anybody can do

515
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,820
um and then the setting the tone when we

516
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,799
think leaderships there's a vast

517
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,299
difference and there's been a lot of

518
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,700
Articles gosh linkedin's full of them

519
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,940
right leadership isn't a title right it

520
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,559
also goes down to the role you're

521
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,539
playing on your team it doesn't require

522
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,940
a title right there are those

523
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,580
influential people that I'm sure

524
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,080
everybody's worked with that you're like

525
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,419
dang this person really leads the team

526
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,100
and they make a difference and they do

527
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,900
these things and people just naturally

528
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,240
kind of Follow that person

529
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,640
um you may be one of those people

530
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,039
um and so everybody can set that tone

531
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,780
where there can be leadership in

532
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,700
different areas as well maybe you're

533
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,440
going to be the leader in making the

534
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,660
environment feel safe right you're

535
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,660
openly mitting hey I made this mistake I

536
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,700
want to learn for it from it and making

537
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,679
that environment okay to do the things

538
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,020
those are other things where you can

539
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,960
today be a leader without that title so

540
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,880
these are things that should that can

541
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,400
apply to everybody that you can begin

542
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,320
doing to slowly and Grading it into your

543
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,659
culture doing a little bit is much

544
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,700
better than doing nothing yeah and

545
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,919
that's one of the big things and the

546
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,679
idea of the hit home of integrating it

547
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,020
into your culture do a little bit at a

548
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,200
time versus it being something that

549
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,179
Giants you do think that you're eating

550
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,940
all at once taking a bite by bite

551
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,140
I

552
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,260
we realize that there are going to be

553
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,880
people in your organization that are

554
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,340
going to click on every link just

555
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,260
because just because this one might be

556
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,080
the one that's real and creating that

557
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,640
environment where they can come to and

558
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,340
admit those mistakes is so important

559
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,980
back to our title the pretty penny we

560
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,780
understand that the first thing that

561
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,220
people think about in cyber security

562
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,260
attacks is that's going to cost our

563
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,000
company a lot of money but here's the

564
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,620
deal and I'm just going to read it

565
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,419
straight off of here because the query

566
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,340
is saying it and I want it to solidify

567
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,679
with all of you cyber security is more

568
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,020
than just the pretty penny providing

569
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,179
your employees the knowledge to identify

570
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,100
cyber threats are going to save you

571
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,260
Millions on the back end and that's a

572
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,100
fact

573
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,020
all right

574
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,740
we are done so we purposely kept a

575
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,120
little bit shorter we are right before

576
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
lunch we wanted to be aware and

577
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,159
empathetic to that but um we'd love to

578
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,780
hear if you guys have any questions or

579
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,700
anybody has strategies that you guys

580
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,100
have been seeing that do or don't work

581
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,620
in the environments that I'm sure we all

582
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,100
can think of good and bad examples but

583
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,900
we're here to talk

584
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,080
um the QR code is legit to our website

585
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,140
it's legit we should have Rick Rolled

586
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,580
you with it but

587
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,919
we decided to just it links to the

588
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,539
defense unicorn's website if you want to

589
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,039
know more about like where we're from

590
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,919
but yep that's it y'all have any

591
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,059
questions

592
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,790
okay you can clap Josh

593
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:34,589
[Applause]

594
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,480
where are you guys going to go to lunch

595
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,820
yeah that's probably okay

596
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,720
yeah no please

597
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,080
oh no

598
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,960
not just the fear of getting fired but

599
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,080
the fear that the internet out to get me

600
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,600
oh wow

601
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,439
I'm

602
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,620
aware of doing more

603
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,360
hearty with

604
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,900
me our training is not set up for that

605
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,559
no that's that's really sad and I have

606
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,059
seen that as a common tactic

607
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,760
unfortunately of the to the point that

608
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,799
you get so paranoid that you don't want

609
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,700
to even uh there there's a joke that

610
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,620
with some of my colleagues that the more

611
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,419
and more I learned about cyber security

612
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,700
and breaches and attacks the less and

613
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,380
less I want to be on my technology like

614
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,380
that that is that is 100 real

615
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,100
um

616
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,159
but it's so in ingrained in everything

617
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,020
that you do today

618
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,780
um the successes that I've seen in that

619
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,960
area and if others have uh seen other

620
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,360
strategies please feel free to share and

621
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,220
I'll open it up in a second but it does

622
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,320
go with that safety of the idea of that

623
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,080
you're going to make a mistake it's not

624
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,820
a matter of if you're going to get

625
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,740
reached if there's going to be a cyber

626
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,140
compromise it's a matter of when and

627
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,700
then understanding and feeling

628
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,460
comfortable that you have resources you

629
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,020
know what to do afterwards you know that

630
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,760
you have a support network and that's

631
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,500
very hard when the culture unfortunately

632
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,679
has been set into a fear mentality but

633
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
that's where I've seen successes of you

634
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,960
take care of your fellow co-workers

635
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,640
right and you started on a very small

636
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,340
scale of let's talk about it making it

637
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,779
regular

638
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,720
um you know and just because that's the

639
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,220
message coming up there can be a lot of

640
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,659
goodness that's happening at the lower

641
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,679
levels of just being a good teammate for

642
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,059
each other and having those

643
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,760
conversations openly and that slowly

644
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,860
starts to make it feel safer and then it

645
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,140
slowly makes it and it gets contagious

646
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,140
and it kind of grows so they're they're

647
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,480
no matter what like one of the biggest

648
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
risks in cyber security is going to be

649
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,100
humans and if your leadership does not

650
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,740
understand that and prepare for that

651
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,600
then they're failing their employees and

652
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,279
they're failing their culture that's

653
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,140
like

654
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,480
why we put this together and why we feel

655
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,700
so passionate about this topic is

656
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,720
because

657
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,059
it doesn't it doesn't matter how much

658
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,220
training how much money you soak into

659
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,320
training if you're coming at it from a

660
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,120
fear perspective and like I said if I

661
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,860
think my job is on the line or I'm going

662
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,559
to be humiliated or feel stupid I'm not

663
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,659
going to say anything

664
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,880
um I'm not sure what your role is at the

665
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,679
company of you have influence on that I

666
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,799
do believe that leadership has a huge

667
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,360
part to play in that and if you can have

668
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,580
any influence on leadership or providing

669
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,559
that feedback like hey

670
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,720
this needs to be different whether it be

671
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,460
this annual training needs to be broken

672
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,539
out or we need to start this forum where

673
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,159
we can all come together even if it's if

674
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,840
it's physical and it's on a bulletin

675
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,340
board if that's where you know your

676
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,840
office is and you're posting things like

677
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,419
hey this is the most recent one this is

678
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,980
what the text message looks like this is

679
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,620
what the email looks like make sure but

680
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,299
having having that information in

681
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,460
heavily trafficked areas is extremely

682
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,200
important

683
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,299
and being able to share that I mean it

684
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,860
should if people are having to share it

685
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,039
anonymously to feel safe whatever but so

686
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,419
long as it's being shared and the

687
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,279
information is out there for others to

688
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,340
you know identify and say okay if that

689
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,299
happens to me now I know

690
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,419
yep

691
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,980
has anyone else seen successful thought

692
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,460
I mean

693
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,080
yes

694
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,000
I love it absolutely absolutely

695
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,840
I then those credentials are exposed for

696
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,860
longer for one but two then

697
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,340
yeah and that treat treating it as a

698
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,440
learning opportunity as well not only

699
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,299
for the person who made the mistake but

700
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,299
for everybody in a non-humiliating way

701
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,100
you know it's not like everybody look at

702
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
Michaela she made the mistake learn from

703
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,940
her because clearly she's not doing it

704
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,120
right

705
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,240
