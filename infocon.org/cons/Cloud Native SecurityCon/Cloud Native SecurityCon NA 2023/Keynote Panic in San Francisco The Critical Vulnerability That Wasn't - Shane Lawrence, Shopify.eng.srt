1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,979
it's Halloween

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,980
the maintainers of openssl one of the

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,660
most widely used software libraries on

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,700
the internet have just announced a

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,679
critical vulnerability

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,679
there's rumors and information about

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,079
this on security blogs

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,000
everybody in security Circle seems to be

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,760
talking about it but we don't have any

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,060
hard facts yet and in my mind I'm trying

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,320
to figure out what's going to happen

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,220
next it's pretty uncommon for openssl to

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,019
have an issue like this it's an example

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,719
of why we encourage you not to roll your

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,000
own crypto they're just less likely to

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,520
make mistakes than most of us are and as

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,840
I'm trying to figure out what's going to

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,180
happen next it's bringing me back to the

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,520
last time I dealt with a serious openssl

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,219
vulnerability

21
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,600
Heartbleed was one of the most iconic

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,879
vulnerabilities of my career and at the

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,379
time that this happened years and years

24
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,539
ago I was building intrusion detection

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,559
systems in a windowless sock in a second

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,800
station back home and I remember the

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,080
gravity of finding out that millions of

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
servers could have their private Keys

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,979
leaked their secrets decoded and their

30
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,900
identity is stolen

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,280
and as I'm going over the information

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,260
that I'm seeing in these rumors I'm

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,000
trying to think is this one going to be

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,560
like that one

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,900
so at work we've got a team ready I'm

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,939
checking slack I've got other stuff that

37
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,500
I'm supposed to be doing but I can't

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,060
help myself I'm just looking at thread

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,220
Intel and these news feeds and I've got

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,140
what I assure you is a very reasonable

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,780
number of tabs open and I'm just

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,520
refreshing the site over and over and

43
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,439
over again and then the site goes down

44
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,540
it just couldn't deal with the hordes of

45
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,040
traffic from so many people trying to

46
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,500
find out what's going to happen next

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,780
I switched to another tab

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,840
finally the announcement comes

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,700
I'm thinking to myself as I read the

50
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,040
description what's vulnerable how can an

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,200
attacker control this what could even

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,299
fit in an instruction that size

53
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,399
I'm starting to realize after all of

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,960
this work and all of this worry that

55
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,939
it's a dud

56
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,839
so how was your Halloween

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,740
how many people here were involved in

58
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,920
this

59
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,959
oh when we started looking at this we're

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,220
in the dark but we can shed some light

61
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
on it now it actually started way back

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,620
in September of 2021 when a new major

63
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,959
version of openssl came out a great

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,940
presenter once told me never to show

65
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,819
code during a talk so I'm sorry for this

66
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,700
it's C that's probably a capital crime

67
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,280
um just bear with me so this is a bug in

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,319
a puny code decoder now punicode is a

69
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,060
way of taking stuff that's not in the

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,099
Latin character set or not English and

71
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,680
making it sort of english-ish it made it

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,239
more familiar and easier to deal with

73
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,440
for the people who developed this

74
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,080
software it decodes text it moves it to

75
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,879
a new place in memory and on the

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,220
highlighted line we can see that if it's

77
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,200
written more than the maximum it was

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,300
supposed to then stop otherwise keep

79
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,760
going this is a pretty common type of

80
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,500
bug called an off by one error and in

81
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,900
other words it says don't stop until

82
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,819
we've moved one more chunk of memory

83
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,440
than we should have oops

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,420
so more than a year passes it's now

85
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,599
October of 2022 and the vulnerability is

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,879
first discovered my team and the public

87
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,440
don't know anything about it at this

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,420
time but our omniscient narrator does so

89
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,400
we can go take a look at it

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,220
this is taking a chunk of memory and in

91
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,220
this case one chunk too much four byte

92
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,379
unsigned integer and it's moving it into

93
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,840
another place now it's supposed to fit

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
in that decoded buffer but it's taking

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,099
up just a little bit too much space this

96
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,099
is called a buffer overflow so if the

97
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,200
buffer overflows into instructions that

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,420
the processor will later dutifully

99
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,580
execute then we have what's called a

100
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,099
remote code execution or an rce on the

101
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,580
other hand if the Overflow is used by

102
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,620
something else later but it just reads

103
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,120
that memory it's probably just going to

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,920
cause it to crash and we call this a

105
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,140
denial of service or dos

106
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,180
there's an additional failure mode for

107
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,379
dos that they found out a little bit

108
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,819
after this where you can actually fill

109
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,440
that payload with a whole bunch of dots

110
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,060
and that makes it way more likely that

111
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,340
you can exploit this but well you're

112
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,200
only overflowing it with dots so there's

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,959
no risk of rce you only have a higher

114
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,700
likelihood of Dos

115
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,560
and again we didn't know any of this at

116
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,659
the time the very first that anyone

117
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,478
heard of it was on October 25th the

118
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,639
openssl project team announces a new

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,440
update they say it's a security update

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,600
it's the highest severity level which is

121
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,000
critical and right from the start we had

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
some issues there were some confounding

123
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,540
factors that made this harder to deal

124
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,440
with

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
for when they announced it without

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,180
telling any cve numbers or a name there

127
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,040
was a sort of unofficial nickname but

128
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,199
people were reluctant to use it and so

129
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,639
everyone that I was coordinating with

130
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,800
was just calling it The open SSL update

131
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,080
which made it difficult to communicate

132
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,540
because as it turns out on the exact

133
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,040
same day they were releasing another

134
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,560
open SSL update for a different version

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,540
but it was totally unrelated there was

136
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,740
nothing whatsoever to do with this

137
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,240
vulnerability

138
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,220
a few days after the announcement things

139
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,780
really started to pick up steam we'd

140
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,340
kicked off incident response queued up

141
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,680
work teams started asset inventory and

142
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,240
dependency checks

143
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,520
we got our first notifications from Paid

144
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,220
vendors and this activity and this work

145
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,600
and this effort that's going into it

146
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,639
keeps increasing and increasing and

147
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,100
increasing until we finally see the peak

148
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,860
anxiety the morning after Halloween

149
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,960
at this time there were conversations on

150
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,580
social media I'm seeing a lot about it

151
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,100
on Twitter and well Mastodon was mostly

152
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,139
silent as was the custom at the time but

153
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,660
people were panicked elsewhere and I

154
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,520
think this comment on a security blog

155
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,280
actually captured the Zeitgeist this

156
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,300
person described it as nasty nasty nasty

157
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,440
of course this is before we have any

158
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,060
information about what it is or what it

159
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,699
does so November 1st comes around

160
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,919
finally we get the details it's

161
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,900
downgraded to a lower severity and we're

162
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,460
getting a good look for the very first

163
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,680
time we can start to map it out and

164
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,139
figure out the defense now most of our

165
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,360
defense actually happens to the left or

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
to the right of this but we want to move

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
as much as possible to the left for next

168
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,638
time

169
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,699
after the details are out in the open we

170
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,440
can take a look at what it's going to do

171
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,840
we can map it out and see how this works

172
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,820
this is a simplification but it gets the

173
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,979
gist of it an attacker can take a poison

174
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,560
certificate it gets decoded it overflows

175
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,419
if it puts a nasty instruction on the

176
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,880
stack we have our C if it puts a little

177
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,440
chunk or a whole bunch of dots somewhere

178
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,380
else when we maybe have DOS

179
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,060
so we've got a road map for our

180
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,440
vulnerability but we still need to know

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,940
what's vulnerable and I think this is

182
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,620
one of the most important parts for us

183
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,280
at Shopify we had thousands of images

184
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,259
hundreds of thousands of PODS and

185
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,240
thousands of people and we have to find

186
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,940
out you know who owns these what's in

187
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,340
them we need an asset inventory and we

188
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,720
need to know what those assets are made

189
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
of

190
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,300
so has anyone heard anything about

191
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,240
s-bombs lately or just just me okay is

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,860
anyone sick of hearing about s-bombs

193
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,639
lately

194
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
yeah you're in the wrong room uh so I

195
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,660
think the reason that there's this sort

196
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,419
of uh fatigue around s-bombs is that you

197
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,520
put all this effort into creating this

198
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,460
registry of what your artifacts contain

199
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,380
and you want to know what these s-bombs

200
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,940
can do for you

201
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,979
so s-bombs aren't new they popped up

202
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,960
eons ago originally I think mostly for

203
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,620
tracking licensing but uh here is what

204
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,960
s-bombs have done for me lately before

205
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
the vulnerability was even described we

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,819
had this query shared by my colleague

207
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,919
that was able to tell us exactly what

208
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,199
was affected and exactly where it was

209
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,940
running and this is as you can see on

210
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,400
October 31st before we really know the

211
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,740
details of the vulnerability so this is

212
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,560
what s-bombs have done for me lately

213
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,900
we saw the scary Red map of Badness and

214
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,699
now that we know what we have running

215
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,319
this we can try to figure out our

216
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,960
mitigations as it turns out uh you need

217
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,880
to be running openssl and there are a

218
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,319
lot of other Alternatives now like

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,240
boring SSL you need to be running

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,819
version three and there were still lower

221
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,880
major versions being maintained and very

222
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,580
commonly used and so those weren't

223
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,440
affected at all you need to convince

224
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,539
something to decode it which as it turns

225
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,580
out for servers comes after chain

226
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,440
validation so you'd have to already

227
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,780
trust a poison certificate before you

228
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,120
even start processing this you also only

229
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,099
get that four byte overflow into used

230
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,259
memory in most cases which depending on

231
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,879
how the compiler lays it out it's

232
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,379
possible that something bad could happen

233
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,180
but it's very unlikely I haven't seen

234
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,639
this exploited in the wild at all and

235
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,500
even if you've got those dots it just

236
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,960
crashes the program it's still a heavy

237
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
cost for the attacker to get it to

238
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,979
process this and so we can just add more

239
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,719
compute power temporarily until we can

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,458
block it

241
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,979
so I I saw that some of you said you

242
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,659
worked on this how many people at your

243
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,399
company you were working on this for

244
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,920
anyone here was it more than 10

245
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,019
more than 20.

246
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,120
more than 40.

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
yeah the impact of this misalignment is

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,220
in the time and effort spent on it does

249
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,200
anyone have a truly unlimited budget or

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,899
unlimited head count unlimited time

251
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,120
even if you're not constrained by your

252
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,339
policies there are intrinsic limits you

253
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,920
can only interview and select and hire

254
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,260
an onboard so fast and I think we can

255
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,820
all agree that the fiscal outlook for

256
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,220
Tech and 2023 doesn't look like it did a

257
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,260
couple of years ago more companies are

258
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,120
expecting us to be more deliberate we

259
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
need to justify our expenditures more

260
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,959
and more and I think that's what matters

261
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,700
most to corporations and investors but

262
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,380
this is actually what I care more about

263
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,200
there's a more significant risk and that

264
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,940
is the time and effort spent on that

265
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,980
could have been spent on automating

266
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,860
things that are likely to be mistaken by

267
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,240
developers and leading to security

268
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,279
misconfigurations we could be building

269
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,899
out detection for a more severe

270
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,580
vulnerability or we could be working on

271
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,660
Outreach

272
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,279
when we see these things we need to use

273
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,500
the available info we need to weigh the

274
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,480
opportunity costs against the risk of

275
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,760
compromise what's the business impact

276
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,339
what's the user impact in our case

277
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,080
that's millions of merchants who depend

278
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,880
on us for their livelihood and of course

279
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,640
there's user privacy to consider so this

280
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,620
is why we had dozens of people working

281
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,300
on this when it was first announced and

282
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,580
this is why I would urge you instead of

283
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,200
just saying this is a waste of time and

284
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,779
try to YOLO it next time try to prepare

285
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,060
ahead of time so that the effort comes

286
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,980
before rather than after

287
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,140
and just to be very clear I don't hate

288
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,120
openssl at all I think they actually did

289
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,519
a really good job on this they announced

290
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,200
the patch very quickly after it was

291
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,779
reported on its own at first it seemed

292
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,000
like it could cause an rce and they

293
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,800
responded to new information by dropping

294
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,660
the severity to high if you were

295
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,880
frustrated by the way that this was

296
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,920
handled I would urge you to consider

297
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,200
what's happened in the past when other

298
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,779
vendors have minimized the impact of a

299
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,700
vulnerability after it was discovered or

300
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,500
reported and how disastrous the

301
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,019
consequences from those were

302
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,120
the most important thing if we want to

303
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,440
reduce the effort after these things

304
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,839
come out is to have an upgrade ritual at

305
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,579
a regular Cadence I like automation

306
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,560
something like dependabot is great here

307
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
you need to have exception lists because

308
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,399
there are going to be things that you

309
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,079
aren't able to upgrade review those

310
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,660
often and include the stakeholders in

311
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,279
that process so that they are

312
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,260
continually justifying the existence of

313
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,660
this out-of-date software track the time

314
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,700
since the last update for all of your

315
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,440
assets if you can do that you can look

316
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,000
for the outliers and you know exactly

317
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,380
where the pain points are going to be

318
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,240
next time then map those special

319
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,399
mitigations for the exceptions

320
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,220
I really like old software at home I do

321
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,860
not like old software at work in a

322
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,839
previous role I was Consulting for a

323
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,459
company that had an electron microscope

324
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,399
and it only had drivers for Windows NT I

325
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,380
hated that machine but there was no way

326
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,760
I was going to convince this client to

327
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,980
get rid of it it had proprietary drivers

328
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,540
the company that made them was out of

329
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,740
business and they're not going to throw

330
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,000
away a perfectly good electron

331
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,980
microscope because Shane told them to

332
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,440
you might have a different example maybe

333
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
your boss insists on reliving their

334
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,459
Glory Days on the slopes of ski free or

335
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,320
playing chips challenge maybe they

336
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,579
insist that Windows entertainment

337
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,260
package just isn't the same unless it's

338
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,500
running on a 486 with Windows 3. as

339
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,540
security practitioners we should try our

340
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,100
very best to get people to do the best

341
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,440
thing sometimes we can only convince

342
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,660
them to do something like hey maybe get

343
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,360
that machine off of the company Network

344
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,180
track what they're doing and why

345
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,820
and usually I would encourage you to do

346
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,100
detection for any vulnerability that

347
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,660
comes out I still think that's a good

348
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,180
idea and my go-to is usually Falco in

349
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,100
this case Falco is great but it's only

350
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,899
going to read the first 80 bytes of a

351
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,820
buffer by default you can modify the

352
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,260
snap length with an option to change

353
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,240
that but it's probably not worth the

354
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,279
additional overhead in this case instead

355
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,899
let Falco look for other suspicious

356
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,660
activity from as yet undiscovered or

357
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,760
existing vulnerabilities just not this

358
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,040
one if you've got some sensitive system

359
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,660
that you can't upgrade and you really

360
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,459
need to mitigate this threat or you're

361
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,139
getting hammered with a DDOS from those

362
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,300
dots we talked about earlier and set up

363
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,820
a circata IPS it can use another ebpf

364
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,220
detection tool that's geared towards

365
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,320
Network traffic sniffing or just use

366
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,639
fluent D or something like it to

367
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,800
aggregate logs from affected systems and

368
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,480
then alert on that poison payload when

369
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,339
it's detected

370
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,260
we saw this timeline

371
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,660
and we can replace the dates on here

372
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,760
with different ones for just about any

373
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,920
vulnerability and we're going to over

374
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,019
and over and over again there are

375
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,399
definitely things that we'll need to do

376
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,220
again on the right side of our timeline

377
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,440
but if we consider the Inglorious work

378
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,660
on the left side it is much more

379
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,519
impactful in addressing these

380
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,380
vulnerabilities and it has the greatest

381
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,600
impact on security

382
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,459
so if we want to be prepared for the

383
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,980
next threat whether it's nasty nasty

384
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,720
nasty as one commenter said or another

385
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,240
dud we can't blame maintainers for not

386
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,740
predicting the impact on our

387
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,720
environments right from the start we

388
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,339
can't presume to be some sacred group

389
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,380
that just issues edicts to developers

390
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,480
telling them what to do and we certainly

391
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,160
can't treat every new risk as a

392
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
sensational surprise what we can do

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,180
though is we can map and threat model

394
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,399
our environment we can build Bridges

395
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,500
with Builders and encourage developers

396
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,660
to follow best practices by working with

397
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,120
them to do so we can start preparing

398
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
right now

399
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
if we do that we can uphold our

400
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
responsibility to our employers to our

401
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,839
stakeholders our customers and the

402
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,820
community we can protect their privacy

403
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,740
we can earn their trust and we can be

404
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,600
responsible with their resources and

405
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,700
maybe just maybe we can even preserve

406
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,110
our conference budgets

407
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,360
