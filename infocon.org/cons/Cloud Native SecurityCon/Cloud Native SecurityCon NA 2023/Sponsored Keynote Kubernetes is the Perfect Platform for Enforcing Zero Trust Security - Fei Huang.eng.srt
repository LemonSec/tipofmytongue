1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,899
hi everyone nice to meet you today my

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,540
name is FEI Huang I came from a social

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,919
security

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,300
so today my topic is about kubernetes is

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,940
a perfect platform for enforcing zero

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,320
trust security

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,359
let's get started

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,240
so let's use the famous log4j

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,180
vulnerability as an example I think

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,300
everybody and urban knows that first a

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,359
lot for gcpe was discovered on November

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,640
2021 only one week after that right

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
there's a real world exploit attempt was

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,320
reported

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,780
and then of course the patch was

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,180
released a few weeks later in the next

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,420
few weeks and months we keep seeing new

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,480
patches uh published but at the same

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,739
time new related cve are also reported

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,500
so for the companies I mean we have a

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,719
lot of clients customers they have to

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,059
keep patching their applications keep

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,600
waiting for the new patches right

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,420
so this whole process takes a few weeks

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,880
or months or even more I think yesterday

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,299
Brian mentioned there's a cve not being

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,479
patched after 15 years that's kind of

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,659
crazy so they all obviously we all

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,540
understand this is a chasing game we

30
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,600
call this reactive security model

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,299
so we have to scan monitor detect

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,720
respond based on real incidents we have

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,299
to keep waiting for the new patches this

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,700
is working but I don't think it's

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,259
efficient I don't think it's enough

36
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,380
right

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,320
so how about the CVS that without

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
effects how about you know can we

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,020
prevent log 4G like critical security

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,079
issues even before it's been discovered

41
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,200
the answer is yes please think about

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,799
this how about we can detect attack

43
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,140
at the network entry point even before

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,000
it hits the real application

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,098
how about we can block the command

46
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,500
control Links at real time

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,739
and we can block any suspicious process

48
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,920
of file system access no because this is

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,860
a never-thinking process before it could

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,080
be a remote code execution it could be a

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,640
crypto Miner

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,340
and the idea is we should minimize the

53
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,280
attacking surface right at runtime and

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,980
we should lock down the behavior of

55
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,660
every Running part

56
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,020
so we call all those good functions

57
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,120
proactive security model or zero trust

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,819
the security controls

59
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,519
so why kubernetes is the perfect

60
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,640
platform for this new security model

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,220
let's use a real workflow think about

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,300
that see a developer could Define the

63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,660
security manifest into a yaml file it

64
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,599
can even Define the application runtime

65
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,360
forward policy into the Yama file as

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,819
well because developers is the only

67
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,459
person know how this container is going

68
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,019
to talk couldn't communicate in the

69
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,080
runtime so those information can be

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,900
checked into the git repository same as

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,300
their source code right and then the

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,980
build pipeline going to carry it over

73
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,980
all the way to the writing clusters

74
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,200
choose a new vector-like Solutions we

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,879
will be able to pick up those security

76
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,060
Manifesto also the policies directly

77
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,640
from kubernetes at runtime then

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,340
Federated the policy out enforce it

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,040
right away the beauty is this whole

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,980
process can be fully automated you know

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,959
oh I mean you can see that the

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,239
kubernetes does make a security solution

83
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,540
much smoother much stronger and much

84
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,780
better that's that's why

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,420
so I would like to use two real customer

86
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,260
profiles to emphasize runtime zero trust

87
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,019
security control is very important

88
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,200
a customer which is a fortune 200 in the

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,080
price another one is a fully SAS based

90
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,700
Financial Service online bank right

91
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,900
interestingly they all run their

92
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,019
containers in multiple complicated Cloud

93
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,220
environment they have you know Cloud

94
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,220
hybrid Cloud multiple cloud on-prem or

95
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,639
even on Airgas environment so it does

96
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040
require security to be managed scaled

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,660
the same way

98
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,199
so the multi-cluster Federation and also

99
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,960
the security management is is needs to

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,340
be supported

101
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,880
another strong requirements is you know

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,820
those applications in production are

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,320
mission critical

104
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,600
basically you know that company's most

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,660
important assets it does require you

106
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,240
know they have a strong runtime

107
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,699
protection in place so they use zero

108
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,979
trust runtime protection with security

109
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,380
Automation in place to make sure it's

110
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,440
not slowing down the devops process

111
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,900
and

112
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,120
there's also compliance requirements in

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,600
in the play right uh for the uh those

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,580
Mission critical you know workloads

115
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,800
there are all kinds of compliance

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,120
requirements in different countries

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,419
different Industries so to satisfy that

118
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,419
they use the layer 7 container follow

119
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,600
with buff and DRP enabled which does

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,360
help them to pass auditing from for

121
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,020
example stock 2 PCI DSS or HIPAA

122
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,259
so due to the time limitation today I

123
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,180
mean I can only highlight a few things

124
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,080
about zero trust for kubernetes for more

125
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,300
details please feel free to stop by our

126
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,180
booth at the solution showcase we also

127
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,139
have a free ebook from this QR code you

128
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,600
can download so that's my presentation

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,940
today and thanks everyone

130
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,419
okay
