00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
welcome to kubecon oh wait this is not a

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,839
Colo anymore

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,780
Welcome to Cloud native security con the

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,360
first of its kind in Seattle North

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,660
America

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,960
it is so great to be here with you all

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,580
today

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,640
we have gathered here because security

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
the topic of this conference is the most

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
important and pressing issue we face as

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,840
an industry and as an open source Cloud

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,239
native community

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,480
much has been said on the topic in many

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,920
forums

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,379
but this conference is different

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,460
cios and csos they worry about security

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,199
in the shift left phenomenon

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,420
necessitated by containers and

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,239
microservices which are our Jam here in

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,059
Cloud native developers mitigate those

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,440
worries

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,180
this conference is for those Developers

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,479
you are at the first open source vendor

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,640
neutral practitioner driven conference

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
for security

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,158
great choice

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,159
this is where you can learn how to build

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,500
and deploy software securely and teach

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,240
others what you know

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,700
this is after all a collective sport

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,320
that goes across organizations

32
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,500
from what I'm hearing Cloud native is

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
the now and the Future Would you folks

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,780
agree

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,799
I want to hear that louder because this

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,680
is not convincing

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,860
all right

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,119
yes I agree with you everyone is

39
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,280
becoming a cloud native developer

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,140
according to Independent research by

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,320
slash data there are over 7.1 million

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,439
Cloud native devs and Counting

43
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,840
given the changes that our Paradigm

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,419
brings it's going to need a paradigm

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,580
shift to level up the cloud native

46
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,220
security posture

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,940
and level up we really must

48
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,040
security within the cloud native

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,440
ecosystem is deeply complex you know

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,940
this better than anyone that's why you

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,379
showed up here

52
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,480
all of us to be focused on rapid

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,819
development and deployment and that is

54
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,680
why Cloud native is fast becoming

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,599
ubiquitous we're essential to

56
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,780
organizations and businesses everywhere

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,980
but that also means more exposed edges

58
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,860
and nodes greater attack surfaces and

59
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,500
ultimately less control

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,200
I mean who here lost countless evenings

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,940
and weekends fixing the log for J

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,680
vulnerabilities over the past year

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,599
anyone

64
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,519
and when involved in lock 4J raise your

65
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,080
hand

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,500
yep yep exactly

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,300
some of us are still dealing with that

68
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,220
today

69
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,620
The Experience we're having with we've

70
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,400
had

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
should remind us

72
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,760
that security is not a one and done task

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,180
and no person is an island when it comes

74
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,780
to Security in modern times

75
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,500
at cncf the focus on security is beyond

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,340
directives reports this community

77
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,900
realizes that it's an ongoing

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,760
conversation

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,480
and a conversation is a must because

80
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,000
things are looking pretty dire right now

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
the cost of us not doing anything is

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,799
very high

83
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,560
the 2022 cost of a data breach report

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,220
from IBM security and ponemon Institute

85
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,739
revealed that 83 percent of

86
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,200
organizations had experienced more than

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,659
one breach

88
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,340
and the impact was that the customer

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,060
suffered because sixty percent of

90
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,159
organizations breaches led to increased

91
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,459
prices being passed on to customers

92
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,099
and then talking about how this is

93
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,760
across organizational team sport

94
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,699
79 of organizations are not deploying a

95
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,680
zero trust environment

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,199
that is really not good

97
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,820
because ultimately what that's leading

98
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,040
to if you see here is almost 20 percent

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,960
of breaches are occurring because the

100
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,300
compromise at a business partner

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,419
and keep in mind by the way that almost

102
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,520
half the breaches that occur are

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,979
cloud-based that's our world in Cloud

104
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,340
native

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,220
the same study uh broke out the costs

106
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,560
for breaches when you look at hybrid

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,080
Cloud environment the average cost of a

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,479
breach on an organization is 3.8 million

109
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,800
dollars

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,419
when you look into the private Cloud

111
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,240
world that number goes up to 4.2 million

112
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,620
dollars

113
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,699
and when it's public clouds it's over 5

114
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,320
million dollars

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,199
and this is just the average cost not a

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,759
not a good thing especially in the times

117
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,479
we face today

118
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,280
that doesn't mean no one's doing

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,000
anything our cios and csos they're doing

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,320
their part

121
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,199
ner predicts that organizations will

122
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,960
spend over

123
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,000
188.3 billion dollars on infosec and

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,419
risk management in 2023.

125
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,759
they also flag Cloud security as the

126
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,240
fastest growing with 27 increase this

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,280
year

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,300
so that's wonderful but the problem is

129
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,360
that top-down Solutions will not fix

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,300
what truly needs to be a Bottoms Up

131
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,740
community-led movement

132
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,320
proof is when you in the state of the

133
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,660
cloud security 2002 entity report from

134
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,680
sneak 77 of organizations said that poor

135
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
trainings and lack of collaboration were

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,320
their major challenges there are Silo

137
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,880
teams often working in separate

138
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,160
countries time zones using different

139
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,680
tools policy Frameworks and this is just

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
within one organization in the cloud

141
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,580
native environment we are interacting

142
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,699
with so many other entities throw in a

143
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,740
lack security policy and there's the

144
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,360
recipe for your security breach right

145
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,539
there

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,840
at cncf in the cloud native ecosystem

147
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,120
we have a perspective

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,400
we believe that security is

149
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,900
people-powered

150
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,120
we all benefit when we collaborate

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
together as a knowledgeable vendor

152
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,919
neutral Community to develop the tools

153
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,319
and processes that are going to up level

154
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,819
our posture

155
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,039
whether it's creating use cases defining

156
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,500
security scenarios developing best

157
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,380
practices and anti-patterns

158
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,139
a key point to remember is that the

159
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,300
conversations we have and the assets we

160
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,280
create together are publicly accessible

161
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,520
and they endure between roles jobs and

162
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,900
life changes

163
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,240
so the lessons in Cloud native security

164
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,440
have staying power

165
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
that is why I believe that cloud native

166
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,060
presents the best best place in in for

167
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,520
industry collaboration on security

168
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,919
practitioners and developers folks like

169
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,139
you gather here and share their

170
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,479
development and deployment expertise and

171
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,759
that's why we're in a position to teach

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,139
each other

173
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,599
we're all a global team of doers and

174
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,880
when we work together we cover far more

175
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,860
ground than any single organization

176
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,780
alone

177
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,880
going back to the conversations that we

178
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
need to continually have

179
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,240
they cannot happen without each and

180
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,440
every one of you

181
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,900
the humans behind Cloud native

182
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,359
who here has heard of tag security

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,620
yep most of many of you

184
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,419
raise your hand higher I like can't see

185
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,220
it I have these lights this is really

186
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,639
hard okay awesome most of you do this

187
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,699
wonderful 165 person strong group of

188
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,340
contributors develops and evolves This

189
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,199
Cloud native security through education

190
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,720
partnership and engaging projects and

191
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,060
communities I have directly heard from

192
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,460
projects the game changing impact

193
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,259
they've had on their security project

194
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,940
posture with the

195
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,099
super useful feedback given

196
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,259
an example of that is their security

197
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,960
Pals program where someone from tax

198
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,240
Security will work hand in hand with the

199
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
cncf project to integrate security from

200
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,020
the get-go

201
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,479
keep in mind for any project applying to

202
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,240
be an incubated cncf project they have

203
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,479
to go through a tag security audit

204
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,520
this organization this group is also

205
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,560
famous for their numerous well

206
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
researched pieces of content such as the

207
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,459
cloud native security white paper that I

208
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,600
quote over here

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,180
I suggested as a must read

210
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,580
as they say in this paper the cloud

211
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,339
native Paradigm dictates the need for

212
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,320
new security mechanisms

213
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,080
our belief is that the answer is an

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
industry collaboration

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,940
a wonderful example of this multi-vendor

216
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,580
open source open source industry

217
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,860
collaboration is the project Sig store

218
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,580
which kubernetes adopted last May

219
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,339
this helps users easily verify the

220
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,320
distribution that they are using and is

221
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,899
it is exactly what it claims to be

222
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,760
six store has been a collaboration

223
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,519
between multiple organizations starting

224
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,620
with red hat and Google open source

225
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,500
security and it has now developed with

226
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,399
the open ssf other organizations such as

227
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,640
um Academia

228
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,560
for-profit entities Etc

229
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,240
as one of the founders of the project

230
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,940
says security truly is a

231
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,000
multi-dimensional problem today and six

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,580
stores success is a direct result of

233
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,580
open multi-vendor collaboration because

234
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,480
ultimately today you need modular

235
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,860
interoperable Solutions that's only

236
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,480
possible when you bring in diverse

237
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,899
perspectives

238
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,580
the cncf itself is supporting the

239
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,839
community efforts and Industry

240
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,700
collaboration by maintaining a very

241
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,440
careful security posture for our

242
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,779
projects we've partnered up with the

243
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,240
open source technology Improvement fund

244
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,700
ostiff

245
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,980
to conduct audits a security audits for

246
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,320
our projects we also do fuzzing Audits

247
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,940
and ultimately that's resulted in

248
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,399
hundreds of bugs being found

249
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,620
we're also adopting s-bombs or software

250
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,100
bill of materials all over if you want

251
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,080
to learn more about how we did it I

252
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,640
highly recommend catching up with our

253
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
CTO Chris anischeck at this conference

254
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,360
whose Mantra is s-bombs everywhere

255
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,079
foreign

256
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,110
's really passionate about them

257
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,880
[Applause]

258
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,399
so coming back to this conference

259
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,100
we are here at Cloud native security con

260
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,560
its first ever of its kind

261
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,660
and we're a global community of

262
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,360
developers and Security Experts

263
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,880
we will tackle issues of security

264
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,760
together here and further on

265
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,240
we'll share our experiences successes

266
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,399
perhaps more importantly failures and

267
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,720
help with the collecting of

268
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,160
understanding

269
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,459
will create Solutions that's right the

270
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,560
practitioners are leading the way

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
having conversations that you need to

272
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
have that's all of you

tomorrow at 9 25 a.m which talks which

290
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,600
is it takes the community to raise a

291
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,519
conference it'll tell you more about how

292
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,680
Cloud native security con this place

293
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,620
your act came to be

294
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,260

engineer at Google and a co-chair of our

304
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,940
beloved cncf tag security and he works

305
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,260
to improve the security of the open

306
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,579
source ecosystem day in Day Out

307
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,399
they have selected some amazing talks

308
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,339
which go into depth and share people's

309
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,040
perspectives and experiences as I looked

310
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,540
through the agenda it was really hard to

311
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,920
pick my favorites

312
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
two things stood out

313
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,480
first was an end user journey by Yahoo

314
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,240
about how to secure your supply chain at

315
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
scale that's happening today 11 to 11

316
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,639
35. and then the other going back to

317
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,920
that stat we looked at about how over 70

318
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,019
percent organizations are not deploying

319
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,079
a zero trust architecture is a talk by

320
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,060
Frederick cots on establishing a

321
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,620
production zero trust architecture

322
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,139
highly recommend you attended because we

323
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,760
got to fix that stat

324
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,980
that's also happening today at 11 50 and

325
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,899
room is listed on the slides

326
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,120
learning and developing our security

327
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,040
posture is

328
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,160
it's a multi-track activity there are so

329
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,040
many things we can do and if you want to

330
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,220
get your hands dirty I highly recommend

331
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,779
joining the capture the flag experience

332
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,500
today it's about tomorrow you go to room

333
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,139
615 R16 or you can also send a message

334
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,120
on slack to the channel that's listed on

335
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,740
the slides I'm going to let you take a

336
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,620
picture if you want it

337
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,720
participants can play three increasingly

338
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,060
treacherous and demanding scenarios to

339
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,160
bushwhack their way through the dense

340
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,100
Jungle of cloud native security
