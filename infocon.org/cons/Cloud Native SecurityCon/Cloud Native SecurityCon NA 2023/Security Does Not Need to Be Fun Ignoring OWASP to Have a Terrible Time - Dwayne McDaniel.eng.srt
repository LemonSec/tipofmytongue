1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,620
hey everybody Welcome to the last

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,440
session of the first day

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,440
of cloud native security con

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,000
I expected a round of applause for that

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,940
yeah you got the right idea uh yeah I

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,320
know it's the last session of the day

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,360
thank you all for coming

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,199
um

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,660
there's just too many of it it was like

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,100
three less people I just go around and

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,020
we just have a conversation instead of

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,340
doing this talk but there's just enough

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,660
do the talk

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,699
um I do have stickers up here so if you

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,460
want this logo sticker the shiny one or

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,080
one that says get guardian come up and

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,340
get them afterward

18
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,260
take as many as you want because I got

19
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,760
to haul them back with me if I don't get

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,140
rid of them

21
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,280
um but

22
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,260
let's jump in

23
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,420
so I'm doing I live in Chicago I flew

24
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,280
out here for this I've been a developer

25
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,840
Advocate this is about 2016. I used to

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,399
work for a company called Pantheon that

27
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,620
guy over there did as well uh this guy's

28
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,879
just walking in

29
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,000
um hit me up on Twitter or Mastodon and

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,039

you look at my Twitter directs you to

32
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Mastodon social

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,379
um have you talk about anything Tech but

34
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,820
I'll also like talk about improv and

35
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,938
punk rock rock and roll in general

36
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,439
karaoke everybody wants to do karaoke

37
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,700
later let me know

38
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,140
I work for a company called get Guardian

39
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,000
anybody here no get Guardian

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
awesome we are secret management our

41
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,820
secret detection and Remediation

42
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,680
primarily so if people hard-coded their

43
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,939
secrets that's what we're home people

44
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,380
with but we're also a platform helping

45
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,240
people do other things like I see

46
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,460
vulnerability later this year you'll see

47
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,900
more and more stuff from our platform

48
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,799
around

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
static code analysis but I'm not here to

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,820
talk about any of that I'm here to talk

51
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,860
to you about something actually I'm

52
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,920
passionate about uh I'm not that deep

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,659
into security like you've seen heard

54
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,759
from a lot of experts here today

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,259
a lot of people have been doing security

56
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,460
for 20 plus years that's not me

57
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,860
instead I got a crash course in this

58
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,060
stuff over the last six months of my

59
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,880
life and uh

60
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,240
that's what inspired this talk so what

61
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,220
does good security actually look like

62
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,659
I think it looks like this yeah

63
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,920
absolutely

64
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,659
um

65
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,340
this is I'm not worried the alarms are

66
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,960
going to go off at three in the morning

67
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not worried my perimeter has been

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,919
breached

69
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,860
good security means I can go camping and

70
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,780
not worry about the house burning down

71
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,400
because I go to my favorite concerts and

72
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
not have to leave before the main act or

73
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,300
The Encore because an alarm bell went

74
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,580
off and ultimately I get to spend time

75
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,620
with people I love doing something that

76
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,879
I want to do

77
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,739
look a look on those kids faces they are

78
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,540
so happy to have their parents home

79
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,980
that's what good security looks like to

80
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,180
me

81
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,980
because all technology has a human cost

82
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,620
Associated whether we admit it or not

83
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,020
we can talk about s-bombs till the cows

84
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,239
come home we talk about automation by

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,620
the end of the day it is human beings

86
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,720
doing this stuff

87
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,640
so what does bad security look like if

88
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,220
good security looks like that

89
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,680
well I'll invoke Tolstoy here

90
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,300
all happy families are alike but each

91
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,340
unhappy family is unhappy in its own way

92
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,220
but there are some commonalities

93
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,500
uh we've all lived through Apache Vlog

94
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,440
for Shell I won't beat this up anymore

95
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,260
uh it's very old at this point 2021.

96
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,560
um but Uber from last year who remembers

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,840
this is a 19 year old kid in the lapsis

98
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,780
group pwned Uber just because he could

99
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,340
he got another slack Channel even

100
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,140
bragged hey I own this thing now because

101
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,940
I you left your

102
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,159
passwords and Powershell scripts they

103
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,840
didn't believe them so we went to the

104
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
New York Times and that's how we found

105
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,540
out about it

106
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,760
just Kidd causing trouble

107
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,980
and then who fell victim to this who has

108
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,480
circled CI in their infrastructure

109
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,680
somewhere

110
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,540
probably not anymore

111
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,140
um

112
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,340
waking up on January 12th to be have all

113
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,319
your tokens just revoked

114
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,879
I don't know fourth was when the revoke

115
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,220
happened like that affected my company

116
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,260
like all of a sudden the system just

117
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,540
wasn't there anymore because there

118
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,580
wasn't able to access it because hey we

119
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,140
got compromised we just had to rotate

120
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,459
this stuff

121
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,620
still ongoing investigation the full

122
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,659
scope of this still isn't known

123
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,239
who all has affected what customers with

124
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,280
circles yeah have been affected still a

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,420
mystery

126
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,920
but we can all agree these are pretty

127
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,200
unhappy people overall because they're

128
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,640
dealing with this

129
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,620
and these are 24-hour shifts of like

130
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,299
figuring out what to do and dealing with

131
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,639
really really unhappy customers

132
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,540
and security teams are really

133
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,418
outnumbered out there Alex rice said it

134
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,460
very succinctly in the best of

135
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,620
organizations developers outnumber

136
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,680
security teams 100 to 1.

137
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,960
that has 100 developers to one little

138
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,940
security alarm over there just putting

139
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,960
that perspective of what that actually

140
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
looks like again this is the best

141
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,220
organizations

142
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,479
so what do we do we just shift left

143
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,919
let's make everyone wear the security

144
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,000
hat

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,240
uh that's I think the fear of Shifting

146
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,740
left like what's shifting left is

147
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,479
supposed to mean

148
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,040
is a little bit different than how I

149
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
think a lot of people interpret it

150
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
especially from the gut reaction of

151
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,320
developers who are like okay it's one

152
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,120
more thing on my plate

153
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,979
okay like I've done one more thing to

154
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,419
implement one more API to worry about

155
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,520
one more dashboard one more

156
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,620
and I'm already fighting kubernetes full

157
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,460
time

158
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,340
because man everybody loves kubernetes

159
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,440
um it's only so many hours in the day

160
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,840
so from the depth perspective like I

161
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,400
can't just focus on that and from the

162
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,960
business perspective who's paying for

163
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,180
this stuff this is perspective I think

164
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,860
looks like this to security I think it's

165
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,199
getting better as more

166
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,380
um Executives and more boards know what

167
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,180
like us bombs are thanks to a

168
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,580
presidential executive order but it

169
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,560
security simply looks like that hey we

170
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
got breached let's focus on security hey

171
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
everything else slowed down let's speed

172
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,060
it back up

173
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,979
and this go through that vicious cycle

174
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,680
until well that's where we're at

175
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,000
and sure there's a tool for that

176
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,000
somewhere one of these does something

177
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,759
we're on there somewhere I think

178
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,220
uh and this is what I think it feels

179
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,740
like insecurity overall especially if

180
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,940
you're a developer at a smaller shop

181
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,520
especially if you are feeling by

182
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,660
yourself you're isolated especially if

183
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,919
you're remote

184
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,560
uh who here has ever read through the

185
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,060
Looking Glass

186
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,160
if you haven't read Alice in Wonderland

187
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,199
and Through the Looking Glass read them

188
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,180
they're tremendously good books it's a

189
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,160
brain cleanser they're just nonsense

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,720
it's wonderful wonderful mathematic

191
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,300
nonsense but it's true we have to run as

192
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,740
fast as we can just to stay where we're

193
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,900
at and get anywhere else we gotta run

194
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,780
twice that fast that's exhausting and

195
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,280
that's why I think the industry has such

196
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,380
crazy high turnover that's why everyone

197
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,300
is like 90 of people in America are

198
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,759
looking for another job right now

199
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,380
this is why

200
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,100
I think in part

201
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,259
and I think everyone that just saw all

202
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,180
of that is processing it is thinking in

203
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,220
their head well what would it be nice if

204
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,419
they're just a group of really nice

205
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,280
people that just would help me with all

206
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,660
of this

207
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,000
well there is it's called a wasp who

208
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,220
here is a member of wasp

209
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,900
yay you probably didn't need to come to

210
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,639
this talk uh

211
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,180
who here is familiar with a wasp

212
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,639
Yeah the more hands who here could

213
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
explain owas to an audience

214
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
well that's what I'm doing literally so

215
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,720
that I hope I can do it

216
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,580
um

217
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,960
oasp stands for the open web application

218
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,460
security project started over 20 years

219
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,139
ago in fact this is the 20th year

220
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,539
uh 21st year depend on money count dates

221
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,520
and how that all that but anyway there

222
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,460
are vanilla vanilla uh

223
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,199
they're a nice group of people that do

224
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,340
nice things

225
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,199
um they have a mission no more insecure

226
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,020
software but as we saw from one of the

227
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,599
Keynotes there's no such thing as secure

228
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,139
software all software isn't secure

229
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,880
but if you start out with the mission of

230
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,380
like hey we got to stop and secure

231
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,720
software that's a good mission

232
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,539
because that is a Non-Stop mission

233
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,759
and why not get there it's a journey not

234
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,419
a hey we'll one day reach the peak

235
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,800
if you go read their mission statement

236
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
it's really well thought out they argued

237
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,580
a lot in meetings over this I'm sure for

238
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,800
years but they got to this I'm not going

239
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,120
to read it out loud it's pretty long

240
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,319
but you read this you go to the website

241
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,139
you find this and then I think everyone

242
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,819
I've talked to that has hit their

243
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,620
website says this

244
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,740
uh yeah but what do I do with this

245
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,660
there's a great website and all how do I

246
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,620
navigate this thing even Mark uh Julie

247
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,740
Charlie give me just a second

248
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,220
Mark chirpery chirpees Mark trophies

249
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,400
sorry about that uh said in a interview

250
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,319
last year he was one of the founders of

251
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,279
owasp said um

252
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,740
uh the organization has become a

253
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,779
Byzantine Labyrinth

254
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,880
that new people cannot navigate that's

255
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,820
one of the reasons he stepped away

256
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,320
uh I don't think it's that bad I think

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
it breaks down to like hey they do these

258
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
five things

259
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
and all these five things are really

260
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,740
really deep and that's like why I think

261
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,899
when people get confused so I'm gonna

262
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,300
break these down and then talk about how

263
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,580
to get started from where you're sitting

264
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,800
so first is projects this is the thing

265
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,660
they're known for the big one they're

266
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,640
known for is their top ten

267
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,040
we'll get to that in a bit but

268
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,480
basically a project is just an open

269
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,640
source repo you can contribute to or go

270
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,640
pull code from or go look at go examine

271
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,440
volunteers built it

272
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
some of those people are experts been

273
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,459
doing this for 20 some years

274
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,620
new stuff comes in all the time I just

275
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,540
updated this and I'm not 100 sure these

276
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,399
numbers are great but I just updated

277
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
this yesterday or Monday

278
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,700
um

279
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,399
250 total projects in any conceivable

280
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,220
State 157 in a usable State and what I

281
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,899
mean by usable they're in one of these

282
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:37,680
states

283
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,819
Flagship projects

284
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,620
production projects uh there's no

285
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,300
production projects right now but that's

286
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,220
something they invented in October of

287
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,640
2021 or no in October 2022 say nobody

288
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,740
knows what Flagship means so we're going

289
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,240
to make a whole new category called

290
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,120
production ready projects production

291
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
projects and we'll move Flagship

292
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,140
projects over there once they qualify in

293
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,200
we're in January of 2023 so far

294
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,300
nothing's qualified in because it's the

295
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,399
crazy giant list of things you have to

296
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,560
check off and even the top 10 doesn't

297
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,360
qualify at the moment

298
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,399
a zap doesn't qualify because of all the

299
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
bugs but we'll get to that later

300
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,380
um lab projects

301
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,240
and then uh incubator projects then

302
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,380
there's a whole bunch of others that

303
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,000
don't quaff fall in anything like that

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,040
so there's 18 Flagship projects

305
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,140
currently

306
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,420
these have some kind of serious

307
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,399
strategic value

308
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,440
if you're going to start anywhere start

309
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,000
with these Flagship projects just roll

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
through them and say hey could I use

311
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,820
this

312
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,800
but that's still putting a lot of weight

313
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,540
on you we'll get we'll get we'll get to

314
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,140
that later uh 34 lab projects Labs

315
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,940
aren't quite flagships but they're being

316
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,079
worked on

317
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,600
they have a website they got

318
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,720
a bunch of stuff in their repos

319
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
but they're not quite ready to be like

320
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,880
this is what owasp is known for

321
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,740
but they still have a lot of value but

322
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,920
some of these are very specific to

323
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,600
languages like Python and whatnot

324
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,220
then you have incubators these are on

325
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,519
the way to be in lab a lot more of them

326
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,500
if you're going to go make an impact in

327
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,540
an open source organization those are

328
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,459
where I would direct you first all of

329
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,779
these have pull requests that are

330
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,519
waiting to happen all these have

331
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,320
beginner friendly they need

332
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,959
documentation like crazy

333
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,880
it's almost underway and then there's a

334
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,440
whole bunch that just don't fit in there

335
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,060
so that's the first way that they

336
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,980
organize them is by

337
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,760
projects

338
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,800
are categories I should say categories

339
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
then they also organize them by types so

340
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
you can go and say Hey I want to work on

341
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,100
a tool or I need a tool or I don't look

342
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,420
at documentation

343
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,640
and a laundry list it this way as well

344
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,100
without much explanation and you might

345
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,320
notice fun fact

346
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,380
these numbers add up to more than 157. I

347
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,060
remember I said earlier there's 157 in

348
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,220
the usable state

349
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,560
why is that I don't know I wish someone

350
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,420
could explain that to me if you know the

351
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,440
answer to that please have a

352
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,779
conversation with me afterward but this

353
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,820
is the state of oasp right now

354
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,620
um

355
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,060
but

356
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,000
but they said hey I recognize this is a

357
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,700
problem we need to make it more usable

358
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,459
for everyone at home so this is the

359
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,779
software development life cycle in their

360
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:22,920
opinion

361
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,899
if you go look at it it's a nice map

362
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,880
interactive you can say all right I am

363
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,339
at the design phase those

364
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,800
four projects might help me out I'll go

365
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,839
investigate there first this is on their

366
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
website you can go play around with it

367
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,760
along the way of building this they

368
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,320
invented the cre

369
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,959
the common requirement enumeration

370
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,139
cre became a project into itself like

371
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,160
everything else uh opencre.org if you

372
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,100
don't visit any other website after this

373
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,620
put this like third on your list

374
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,220
um

375
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,980
but it's a way to very quickly see hey I

376
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,779
have a high level

377
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,180
um concern a high level

378
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,880
topic I need to drill into quick way to

379
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,940
see inst and cwes and all the other

380
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,620
acronyms they strung it together and one

381
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,540
nice resource for you

382
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,339
so that's the first way

383
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,959
I think you can start thinking about a

384
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,480
lot of projects it's a lot of them

385
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,300
there's a lot there but it's a good way

386
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,920
in

387
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,019
maybe the better way in is get involved

388
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,100
in the community

389
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,680
and don't worry about the global

390
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,200
the history 20-year history of projects

391
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,839
and just go talk to people chapters all

392
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,920
over the world

393
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,100
and just like we're here in Seattle you

394
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,139
can just go hang out with people this is

395
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,339
what it looks like in Paris back in

396
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,079
October this is in the get Guardian

397
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,060
offices you get Guardians based in Paris

398
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,459
but this is the oauth meet up in in

399
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,600
Paris uh who here lives in Seattle

400
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,700
one person yeah you got a luncheon

401
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,519
learns coming up on this uh this coming

402
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,820
Wednesday it's online so you can

403
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,700
everyone in the room can join join in

404
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,399
in fact a lot of the community meetups

405
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,480
are online

406
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,060
or some of them are I should say it used

407
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,220
to be a lot more but then they've slowly

408
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,720
been transitioning I was going to like

409
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,779
the Visa or the Ottawa chapters for a

410
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,100
while but then they stopped doing them

411
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,839
online

412
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,339
but it's people you can go talk to about

413
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,240
security stuff just other security nerds

414
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,040
they also hold events

415
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,740
the big Global events

416
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,740
app SEC days which are smaller

417
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,779
events and then partner events where

418
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,519
they don't actually run the event but

419
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,139
hey if you're no lost member you get a

420
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,540
discount or something nice happens next

421
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,480
big one is in Dublin in two weeks

422
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,579
whole bunch of training uh but the app

423
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,860
SEC day is in the next big app SEC day I

424
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,600
should say is in Ireland

425
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,540
uh educational training

426
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,920
you just Google or DuckDuckGo or u.gov

427
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,959
or whatever you want to use

428
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,139
um search for OAS educational training

429
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,760
you're going to run into a list like

430
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,560
this and you're going to find wow

431
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,079
there's a lot of resources because every

432
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,360
good-hearted Soul who I wish more people

433
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,579
knew about this probably started a

434
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,560
project at one time and started trying

435
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,380
to train people on that specific topic

436
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,060
but there's one org they partner with

437
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,420
and I'm not here to sell you on them

438
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,639
but secure flag's awesome

439
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,399
just flat out state it they have a

440
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,019
partnership with the WASP OAS membership

441
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,760
is really cheap it's 500 bucks for a

442
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,560
lifetime or 50 bucks a year

443
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,740
to be a full-blown member of O wasp and

444
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,600
if you're a member of oasp you have full

445
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,120
unlimited use of this platform and you

446
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,440
can go take

447
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,260
dozens I think 100

448
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,639
I forget the exact numbers over 100

449
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,519
types of trainings on here like full-on

450
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,139
capture the flag events a whole

451
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,600
Community exists around this alone

452
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
so if you want to go meet other cool

453
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
people that are doing cool stuff another

454
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
way in

455
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,940
but along the way you learn

456
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,680
all about

457
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,940
you know how to cryptography in Java or

458
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,980
secure authentication in Java I don't

459
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,720
know why I picked Java when I made this

460
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,899
but I think the job was on my mind

461
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,279
um they also make a lot of Publications

462
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,500
and resources out there a lot of these

463
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,940
cross over with projects that's where

464
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,380
they come from but they're also are

465
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,360
physical books you can buy

466
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,220
are they up to date I don't know how

467
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,420
time works so maybe

468
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,399
yeah so they do a lot and you're

469
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,720
probably still thinking like all right

470
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,060
what do I do with this

471
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,100
I could go and spend four hours of my

472
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,420
life digging through the projects hoping

473
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,560
to hit on something

474
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,480
uh

475
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,940
I think there are four ways then that

476
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,220
are really really simple

477
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,920
and actually practical day to day first

478
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,519
is top ten who here knows or heard of or

479
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,500
even looked up ever or saw reference

480
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,740
somewhere they'll ask top 10.

481
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,600
every hand in the room almost every hand

482
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,279
in the room some people are asleep

483
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,100
that's fine it's the end of the day

484
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,559
10 types type 10 types of attacks going

485
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
on in the world vulnerabilities out in

486
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,099
the world I say type 10 10 types of

487
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,380
attacks they don't say that that's me

488
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,819
but that's a good way to think about it

489
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,439
like all right I'm worried about my app

490
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,720
being secure

491
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,000
what are the top ways I know I should

492
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
secure it well it's top 10 list every

493
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,140
year it changes they haven't come out

494
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,000
the 2022 list yet

495
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
coming out later this year I'm actually

496
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,720
really curious to wear cryptographic

497
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,940
cryptographic

498
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,679
cryptographic failures well Falls this

499
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,540
year if it goes up it's gone up every

500
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,179
year it's been on the list uh broken

501
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,980
Access Control it's going to probably

502
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,720
stay the top but this is again me saying

503
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,280
this

504
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,020
um the top eight are based on industry

505
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,100
data

506
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,020
the last two are based on surveys of

507
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,640
members saying hey what should also be

508
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,600
on this list

509
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,480
so servicide request forgery isn't by

510
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,280
data one of the biggest threats in the

511
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,660
world but all the members said hey this

512
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,799
should be on the list people should know

513
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,720
about this so it's not just a list and

514
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,460
like hey good luck

515
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,840
it's a project

516
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,360
there's a repo for this it goes really

517
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,559
deep

518
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,780
I think the most important part of it is

519
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,179
this one how to prevent there's a whole

520
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,080
section

521
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,059
so if you're building an application and

522
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,500
you're thinking hey how do I secure this

523
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,960
thing go to the top ten go to how to

524
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,179
prevent for every single one run through

525
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,520
it may just make a checklist a big

526
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,080
believer that the best security tool

527
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,940
ever invented is Excel spreadsheets

528
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,980
because you can make a checklist

529
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,799
real easy did we do it or not is the Box

530
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,880
checked

531
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,280
make a big check box it's from probably

532
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,080
somebody already did that with this you

533
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,820
probably just Google that so that's top

534
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,500
10. won't spend any more time on that

535
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,179
cheat sheets

536
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,520
man I love cheat sheets

537
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,679
cheat sheet series that oasis.org this

538
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,700
is the one you should definitely visit

539
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
if you don't visit anything else because

540
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,179
you want to be an expert in 10 minutes

541
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,340
on any subject good enough for your CIO

542
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,860
uh CSO or your CIO

543
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,660
this is a website for you

544
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,760
that can walk in and say hey tell me

545
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,580
about kubernetes security

546
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,860
and while you're talking to them you can

547
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,940
slowly Google

548
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,520
or get to the oauth cheat sheet and then

549
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,799
a quick scan over the page like okay I

550
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,200
understand how this works now

551
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,020
it's a Bare Bones

552
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,600
like as fast as you can go as fast as

553
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,179
you can read it overview of all the

554
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,559
issues known

555
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,320
is it complete and 100 thorough no is it

556
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,520
good enough to make you sound like an

557
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,760
expert in 10 minutes yes

558
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,380
uh should you do this on the regular

559
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,820
probably not but this is a good way to

560
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,720
start

561
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,520
if you've just taken a course in

562
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,020
something and like all right I need a

563
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,460
cheat sheet to hang out with me to

564
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,900
remind me of the key things they already

565
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,059
wrote one for you that's my point

566
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,299
so cheat sheets definitely look them up

567
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,080
the goats the goats are great

568
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
goats are not the grace of all time

569
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,220
maybe they are but deliberately insecure

570
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,780
applications you want to go see how not

571
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,880
to build an application they already did

572
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,960
it

573
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,620
uh there's a bunch of them pie goat um

574
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,200
lab projects wrong Secrets is awesome

575
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
I'm a very big fan of that one we've

576
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,059
done a whole webinar with them uh with

577
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,179
the maintainer and it's how not to store

578
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,700
your secrets how specifically not to do

579
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,539
it

580
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,160
there's a project to show you how to do

581
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,400
it but the greatest of all time of all

582
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,140
of the goats

583
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,299
is Juice Shop who here knows Juice Shop

584
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,460
ah you're gonna love Juice Shop

585
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,260
this is the one to download this is the

586
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,640
one I got running a Docker container

587
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,440
right now I'll show you in a second

588
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,320
but Juice Shop is a fully functional

589
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,000
bug-free

590
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,340
application

591
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,440
that's completely insecure

592
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,080
according to the Lost top 10.

593
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,720
super well documented

594
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,419
tons of articles about it

595
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,160
one of my favorite talks I've seen in

596
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,480
the last year is on YouTube from

597
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,360
from Bjorn that breaks down how to use

598
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,580
it so Juice Shop looks like this this is

599
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,140
around my local

600
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,780
and yeah it's just a

601
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,400
it's a Juice Shop

602
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,620
but it can uh

603
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,559
I was driving myself scripting in here

604
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,860
no I don't uh

605
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,140
but if you go to and this is like the

606
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
secret this is the thing like you open

607
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,160
up like I don't know what I'm doing

608
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,740
it's a built-in CFT

609
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,559
or Capture the Flag CTF

610
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,260
uh built in so if you go to scoreboard

611
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,659
yeah it's a full-on

612
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,500
tutorial on how to hack a website

613
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,020
that tracks your progress as you go with

614
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,299
tips and training as you go

615
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,980
not just how not to build a website but

616
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,620
how to attack a website

617
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,000
all-in-one awesome thing you can run in

618
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
a Docker container they get up in

619
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,580
seconds

620
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,380
that scales

621
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,320
it's amazing so Juice Shop

622
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,059
go check it out definitely should have

623
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,500
it running

624
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,480
zap

625
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,320
who's ever run the ZET attacks proxy

626
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,980
cool we got one back yes yes zap is a

627
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,080
tool you should be running or at least

628
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,400
run occasionally

629
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,640
uh only against things that

630
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,159
you control that you own you have

631
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,780
permission to attack

632
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,880
don't just go randomly attack websites

633
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,039
with this please don't you could but

634
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,539
don't

635
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,580
um it's an automated scan that literally

636
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,520
goes and attacks down the list and tries

637
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,200
every dirty trick

638
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,200
currently on the top 10 list

639
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,419
and then builds a nice report

640
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,640
on what went wrong

641
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,860
so yeah there's only nine alerts but

642
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,539
like the cross domain can this

643
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,100
configuration there's 40 in instances

644
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,840
that oh this is against Juice Shop by

645
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,860
the way

646
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,260
this is how insecure Juice Shop is

647
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,360
so yeah

648
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,520
across great site scripting

649
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,039
session ID URL rewrites

650
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,740
there are a lot of known bugs without uh

651
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,159
with zap and that's why it's not in uh

652
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,020
the production ready

653
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,820
Camp right now

654
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,860
and I'm

655
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,630
previous conversations is like well

656
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,159
[Music]

657
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,780
this tool isn't built for the Enterprise

658
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,000
but at the same time it is built for the

659
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,700
Enterprise anyway oh zap is Awesome

660
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,640
download it run it

661
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,880
these are the four ways in but all right

662
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,980
I'm gonna wrap up

663
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,659
it's dangerous out there

664
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,159
there is a group of people that want to

665
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,120
help you

666
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,440
they're called a wasp they've been

667
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,720
around for a long time

668
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,299
it's a Byzantine Labyrinth to get

669
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,140
through

670
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,580
but

671
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,919
go talk to the people involved

672
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,140
they're all nice they all want to share

673
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,520
their knowledge they all want you to

674
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,960
succeed

675
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,220
they don't want you to sleep better at

676
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,720
night and have better security and stop

677
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,820
writing insecure apps

678
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,400
and I would start here

679
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,919
before last week I probably wouldn't

680
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,440
have said start with juice shop but

681
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,780
Juice Shop is just fun I've been having

682
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,880
a lot of fun with it lately uh when you

683
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,559
get to the advanced things it's like wow

684
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,059
I've never even thought of that for

685
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,100
application security

686
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,200
um zap is a much quicker way to get to

687
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,059
like how do I make my application secure

688
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,799
not how do I learn how to not write

689
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,320
applic bad applications but but that's

690
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,159
it

691
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,440
and if you don't know the top 10 that's

692
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,179
one you should bookmark and every time

693
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,580
you think of building your application

694
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,140
or changing your application just go

695
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,140
review the list anyway I've been Dwayne

696
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,880
I'm a developer Advocate have been for a

697
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,460
few years uh hit me up on Twitter about

698
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,159
anything rock and roll

699
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,980
b-sides Tech I gotta fix that

700
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,419
but I do love b-sides they're awesome

701
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,880
organization and uh

702
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,539
that's my talk

703
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,089
[Applause]

704
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,100
any questions

705
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,400
back there

706
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,539
was always fairly difficult

707
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,440
when I I say the the bug list I mean the

708
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,200
issue queue and it's still there that's

709
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,400
that's the common that's the

710
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,539
conversation that literally the same

711
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:22,860
conversation I had in West Virginia

712
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,679
about about zap is is an Enterprise

713
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,799
ready according to them yeah can you

714
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,600
automate it oh there's problems with

715
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,440
that

716
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,779
There's issues known issues with it

717
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,580
um

718
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,220
unfortunately but they do accept pull

719
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,500
requests and they are open source so if

720
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,700
you can make it work you can make it

721
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,659
work

722
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,860
but that's not a great answer

723
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,100
but I'm actually you know what I got

724
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,440
enough time let's just let's just look

725
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,640
autumn

726
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,679

731
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,840
oh

732
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,840
