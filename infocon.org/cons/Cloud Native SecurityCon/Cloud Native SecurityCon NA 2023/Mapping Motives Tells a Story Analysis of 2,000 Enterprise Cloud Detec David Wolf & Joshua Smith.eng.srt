1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,580
all right guys uh thanks for coming

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,759
we're from Devo and we're giving a talk

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,780
on our detections research and the

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,440
studies that we've had uh covering at

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,079
the end more than 6 000 Cloud native

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,900
detections across the world across

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,260
Industries my name is David wolf I'm a

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,500
security researcher and I'm part of the

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,260
Devo cisect organization we're

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,660
responsible for different forms of

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
product Innovation and engineering

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,739
hmm Josh here is a detections engineer

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,340
actually responsible for creating the

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,160
living breathing alerts oh my God I'm

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,820
good boom all right

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,980
yeah by the way I hate that photo

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,180
um it's really really really bad I don't

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,460
even know how they got it but um please

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,420
don't take a picture of that photo uh

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,320
um

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,700
no I I have a long background and

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,200
offense and defense operations

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
technical operations uh doing pin

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,280
testing uh going after Nations

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,220
adversaries and doing uh doing defensive

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,200
work so

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,960
um my role at Devo is to create content

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,680
or create out of the box alerts so I I

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,619
will recreate environments to to exploit

30
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,140
systems so I can obtain the logs

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,960
um and I write the the some of the

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,100
alerts that David's going to be talking

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,280
about

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,100
he created the innovations that we

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,159
researched and studied looking for

36
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,159
optimization migration opportunities

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,900
interoperability was the core mission

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,540
for assessing these alerts compared to

39
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,340
other seams how can we enable

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,700
transmission and a round circuit

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,100
my background comes from an OT and an

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,960
ICS environment studying Financial

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,119
Services

44
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,799
connected Health Care the extended

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,060
campus and iot and for for me and coming

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
and seeing how detections are deployed

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,580
in different organizations around the

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,239
world was a new research opportunity we

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,060
didn't the

50
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,280
item in this part of our research

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
portfolio came from product Innovation

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,980
but it became immediately apparent that

53
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,420
we were learning new things that we

54
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,220
weren't expecting oh and it is we

55
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,500
started digging in

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,840
this session follows typical research

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,640
format we'll give you a little bit about

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,860
our research lab and our team as to why

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,019
it is that we're conducting this type of

60
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,700
research and give an overview of our

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,860
methods and scope one question was how

62
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,300
did we aggregate the alerts and where

63
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,340
are they coming from and what like how

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,660
did we get them and what were we looking

65
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,260
for and can I jump in real quick yeah

66
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,080
um one thing I will note is the slides

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,420
were prepared in advance and and put out

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,640
on the site

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,980
we modified those slides so if you're

70
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,300
following along on the ones that were

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,340
originally posted you there will be some

72
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,980
confusion in there we're going to get

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,260
the newly revised ones uploaded to

74
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,140
sketch.com or whatever it's called to as

75
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,480
soon as possible uh like but after this

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,000
talk unfortunately so I I didn't want

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
there to be any confusion when people

78
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,700
are trying to follow along

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,400
fair enough

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,040
at our Labs we have three major themes

81
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,980
that our portfolio aligns to we have the

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,379
autonomous sock sort of the second brain

83
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,480
for analysts and how is it can we

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
instrument action

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,780
that

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,019
follows an intelligent response and

87
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,019
reaction at Enterprises and feeding into

88
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,980
soar detection is the trigger for actual

89
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,959
orchestration the second major thing

90
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,459
that we have is the augmented analyst

91
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,280
how can we put an enrich

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,099
the data supplies and the views that

93
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,379
analysts are taking in the sock while

94
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,000
monitoring their data Lake how can we

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,099
give something approaching actionable

96
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,659
intelligence and at least addition

97
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,879
augment with additional data that leads

98
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,920
to new insights in the right place and

99
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,500
at the right time and then third

100
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,858
alert management we conduct an annual

101
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,019
research report with some thousands of

102
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,899
survey respondents that are leaders and

103
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,800
staff socks around the world and we're

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,540
sensitive to the feedback and the pain

105
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,940
points that our survey respondents are

106
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,639
reporting alert management as it turns

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,740
out is a major pain point

108
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,139
especially cited by analysts themselves

109
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,259
as being the primary place that they

110
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,380
want help in the sock and that high

111
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,300
performing stocks have lots of alerts

112
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,639
and once we start getting into managing

113
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,580
hundreds or thousands of alerts it's a

114
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,699
whole different ball game and the scale

115
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,220
and alert management become a problem

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,699
uh Devo seisek we have a clear Mission

117
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,160
we as researchers are researching

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,540
emerging threats

119
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,639
reviewing the vendors and products in

120
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,380
our ecosystem and the data supplies that

121
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,139
all the Enterprises are using and we use

122
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,600
those supplies to solve novel customer

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,620
use cases with a security Focus I as a

124
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,520
Sim provider Devo is strongly related to

125
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,180
visibility and analytics and enriching

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,460
and deriving Insight from data pipeline

127
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,160
is a core part of PSI sex Mission we

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,020
have the data scientists and security

129
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,660
researchers and practitioners and

130
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,880
putting one-on-one together is the focus

131
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,220
for how our our organization is built

132
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,680
um we have the three primary themes

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,419
automated stock controls in the

134
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,699
autonomous sock the second brain to the

135
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,039
augmented analysts whom we enrich with

136
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,380
context and fundamentally alert

137
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,580
management being a a third catch-all

138
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,880
bucket for the to illustrate problems

139
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,940
and the solutions that we're trying to

140
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,460
provide to our end users

141
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,180
for This research project we Loosely

142
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,039
adhered to the miter attack framework

143
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,500
for the purpose of research being three

144
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,320
phases of assess what's there assess the

145
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,259
coverage identify the gaps and then tune

146
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,199
and acquire new defenses so this was a

147
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,419
detections engineering Innovation

148
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,539
project like what what is our coverage

149
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,759
where do we have gaps where do our

150
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,740
customers have gaps and what do we need

151
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,860
to either tune or build in order to

152
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,139
round out a fuller strategy and a

153
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,759
portfolio view for our detections

154
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,160
um in the sysac research lab our team is

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,100
primarily detections Engineers like Josh

156
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,280
with a focus on cloud detections across

157
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,340
platform providers we we have our data

158
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,960
scientists who are busy in the lab right

159
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
now crunching all kinds of data and I'm

160
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
a security researcher as an example so

161
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,060
real quick to David's point one thing we

162
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,539
will talk about is uh when we're talking

163
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,960
cloud providers and the disparity of how

164
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,600
analysts have to understand and and know

165
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,580
those Cloud providers so I just wanted

166
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,560
to point that part out since when it was

167
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,180
brought up about the cloud providers and

168
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,020
and the detections that's all my bad I

169
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,520
just and I hadn't said anything in a

170
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,240
while and I want to say hi

171
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,500
overall research methods and scope I in

172
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,880
the original sample where approximately

173
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,900
14 000 alerts after narrowing down for

174
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,020
keying to specific customers or managed

175
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,479
security providers we came with 6 000

176
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,819
alerts that were within our sample all

177
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,940
based in the cloud internationally uh

178
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,620
two almost two-thirds are coming from

179
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,900
the states one-third from emea and Asia

180
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,400
pack

181
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,940
inside the lab our project was focused

182
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,800
on developing machine learning

183
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,500
classifiers for example for zero trust

184
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,020
and miter attacked labeling and the

185
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,280
generation of new kinds of alert

186
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,979
metadata as well as identifying what

187
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,259
type of motives attackers would have

188
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,960
what verbs they're executing and against

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,380
which nouns so what fundamentally assets

190
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,780
were being targeted especially within a

191
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,900
cloud context we where we have AWS and

192
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,599
Azure and gcp is three primary providers

193
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,199
in our data set and the ultimate attack

194
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,660
path might be the same but the

195
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,740
vocabulary is different

196
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,539
overall we had something on the order of

197
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,779
just about 400 distinct customers within

198
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,039
the data set

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
uh

200
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,700
let's see here

201
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,060
now when it comes to mapping the

202
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,120
detections the labeling it is that we

203
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,360
generated filled in most of what we can

204
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,040
refer to as the miter attack Cloud

205
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,120
Matrix

206
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,760
and this is a composite Matrix for both

207
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
infrastructure and workspaces

208
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
so when we're talking cloud and when

209
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,660
we're developing detections there's a

210
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,860
big difference between Cloud

211
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,940
infrastructure like AWS Azure and gcp

212
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,700
compared to the workspaces cloud-based

213
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,279
workspaces like Office 365 Google

214
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,100
workspace SharePoint these types of

215
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,580
systems

216
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,980
the detection portfolio that Josh and

217
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,080
Company have been developing spans both

218
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
contexts of infrastructure and

219
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,040
workspaces and we mapped our controls

220
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,579
accordingly

221
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,459
briefly in terms of scope a few points

222
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,100
to to harvest from here are that

223
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,740
Financial Services technology companies

224
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,740
and operational technology companies

225
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,720
provided the bulk of our data set

226
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,760
we have significant presence for managed

227
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,920
security providers managed security

228
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,880
service providers and the differences

229
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
between how msps are developing custom

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,380
alerts specifically compared to

231
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,959
Enterprises was interesting it's clear

232
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,060
that there are good reasons for an

233
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,279
Enterprise to Outsource to an MSP

234
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,140
depending on their maturity and

235
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,700
capabilities inside

236
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,720
uh overall we had significant success

237
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
mapping alerts in their metadata to

238
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,060
fundamental pillars and zero trust and

239
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,620
we had

240
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,880
we had 58 of our alerts mapped to miter

241
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,860
attacks successfully where we felt that

242
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,620
the labels that this was the ratio at

243
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,100
which we had confidence in our miter

244
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,880
attack labeling

245
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,320
another key part of the research is

246
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,839
comparing out-of-the-box detections to

247
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,980
custom detections

248
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,000
we have three research themes and the

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,980
first is the autonomous sock and the

250
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,140
autonomous sock is a place where

251
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,440
action happens influenced by Machine

252
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
learning

253
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,500
influenced by artificial intelligence

254
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
the ultimate

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,220
output is some kind of decision making

256
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,160
that's been automated and in the

257
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,500
autonomous sock and using that as a

258
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,300
research theme some of our findings came

259
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,899
and emerge that shed differences between

260
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,959
how the sock in a traditional Enterprise

261
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,079
is different than that for a cloud

262
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,220
uh

263
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,480
one key finding is that cloud Defenders

264
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,700
are significantly more likely to use out

265
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,760
of the box detections

266
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,620
there are multiple reasons behind this

267
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,660
in our interviews and our annual sock

268
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,200
performance report we see that cloud

269
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
specialization for analysts is a huge

270
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,060
skills problem

271
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,560
familiarization and understanding of

272
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,120
what to do and why to do it per cloud

273
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,579
makes cloud defense even more difficult

274
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,600
for an analyst Josh is building

275
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,940
detections for all three major providers

276
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,920
and

277
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,620
let's just having three testing

278
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,019
environments is enough of a pain but to

279
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,120
actually build the skills and the

280
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,500
vocabulary and to understand the

281
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
resources involved and how they're

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,260
different uh is is a huge skills barrier

283
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,240
uh in in the end

284
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,579
Cloud Defenders are not only deploying

285
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,760
infrastructure as code and tariff and

286
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,500
essential we're at a kubernetes

287
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,459
conference now the standardization and

288
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,720
non

289
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,600
let's say non-intrusive customization

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,579
we're supposed to be using as much

291
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,560
boilerplate as possible whenever

292
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,500
possible and it shows itself in the

293
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,540
detection strategy as well compared to

294
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,459
an Enterprise especially something like

295
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,300
a hospital that will have

296
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,800
exotic devices with many different types

297
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,300
of protocols that require custom

298
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,100
detections in comparison I

299
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,639
msps

300
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
and let's say non-cloud

301
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,700
Defenders and Sim strategies are

302
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,440
significantly more likely to use a

303
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,959
custom queries for custom data sources

304
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,459
bespoke applications for example being

305
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,439
non-standard log sources and inputs

306
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,779
something that became clear is a pain

307
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,779
point in our interviews as well as the

308
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,600
data is that we're well past the point

309
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,940
that organizations are defending a

310
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,079
single cloud

311
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,560
it's painful at the very least if some

312
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,279
if a company is on AWS there are more

313
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,720
than likely to have a second Cloud

314
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,760
they're more than likely to be also

315
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,279
defending Office 365 of course they're

316
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,399
going to be they need to have a cloud

317
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,800
detection strategy and a soar strategy

318
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,839
both for workspaces and infrastructure

319
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
and it's not just a single Cloud anymore

320
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,620
and that that increases the complexity

321
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,019
for the sock analysts it increases the

322
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,139
complexity in terms of alert management

323
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,639
and what we see here is we're at the

324
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,959
point now that approximately one in four

325
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,380
socks are have a majority of their stuff

326
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,019
of their detection stack monitoring

327
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,820
cloud

328
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,260
cloud has become a new normal

329
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,000
when it comes to out of the box and

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,240
custom detections we have a sense of

331
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,459
on the on the far side we have managed

332
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,620
security providers being the most likely

333
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,720
to craft custom detections that's part

334
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,040
of the service that they provide they

335
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,959
have their own libraries they're

336
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,880
building custom detections rolling them

337
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,279
out across all of their customers and

338
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,959
it's part of the secret sauce that the

339
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,920
msps bring to the equation for defending

340
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,740
Enterprises whereas if we go and look at

341
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,300
for example an OT and ICS we have uh if

342
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,740
we're thinking about factories we're

343
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,779
thinking about Supply chains and

344
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,180
transportation we have less Innovation

345
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,660
within the sock and we're still at

346
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,760
basic visibility

347
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,120
implementing controls that are that are

348
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,959
off the shelf and available and in the

349
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,000
case of technology companies what we

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,980
have are more standardized assets we

351
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,360
have fewer different types of devices

352
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,940
fewer kinds of iot devices fewer custom

353
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,940
detections that are required

354
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,680
so two takeaways from the autonomous

355
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,639
sock

356
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,620
the first is that out of the box

357
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,420
detections

358
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,540
are key for cloud Defenders

359
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,760
being able to pull from a library means

360
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,620
lower barriers less skill expensive

361
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,139
skill and expertise required and a more

362
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,600
coherent strategy for control end to end

363
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,899
and that as of today cloud is a major

364
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,120
control area for many companies

365
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,880
sometimes a majority of the alert and

366
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,880
detection coverage and this is key for

367
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,820
any Sim and sock automation strategy

368
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,019
boom boom boom there we go thanks David

369
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,240
um so sorry

370
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,079
um

371
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,500
let me uh let me just

372
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,699
sorry about that

373
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,320
um

374
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,199
let me start off by saying real quick I

375
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,079
am not very comfortable with this there

376
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,579
started off with three people which I

377
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,800
liked and now it's grown I should like

378
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,240
it and I will like it I appreciate

379
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,800
everybody coming here so let me get

380
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,019
right right down to it I just had to you

381
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,760
know put it out there for you let's talk

382
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,980
about an augmented analyst and and what

383
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,300
it means

384
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,440
um so augmenting an analyst is simply

385
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,680
just providing them enriched data

386
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,440
um you're giving them metadata and

387
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,779
you're giving them information that they

388
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,060
need to help make informed educated

389
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,040
decisions

390
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
um one of those methods every Sim out

391
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
there or seam however you want to

392
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,360
pronounce it everyone out there they

393
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,120
um they use miter as part of their

394
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,619
enrichment part of augmenting the

395
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,500
analyst and

396
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,640
from what we can see here is typically

397
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,520
the analysts have more visibility

398
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,280
towards the beginning portion or I'm

399
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,339
sorry yeah at let's build sorry less

400
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,839
visibility at the beginning portion told

401
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,579
you I'm not very good at this at the

402
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,160
beginning portion of it and

403
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,760
um

404
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,640
more towards the end so like persistence

405
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,740
for cloud-based coverages right or

406
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,260
cloud-based detections

407
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,340
um

408
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,740
they got a lot of a lot of cloud-based

409
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,080
detections for persistence but not a

410
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,780
whole lot for execution in the cloud

411
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,299
um it draws some concern because you

412
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,620
kind of

413
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,500
it's a different environment than people

414
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,620
are just we're still not wholly

415
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,320
accustomed to working in the cloud and

416
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,820
they may not

417
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,160
know what to look for or they may not

418
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,900
have the information they need sound

419
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,820
yeah all right

420
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,919
whoo sorry thank you all right so

421
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,600
let's talk about

422
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,780
um let's talk about zero trust and

423
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,080
and the typical

424
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,960
connect the typical uh alerts that we've

425
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,840
seen with analysts have been on devices

426
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,179
networks and identities and it's not

427
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,580
covering all the pillars of zero trust

428
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,799
and it's been it's something where we

429
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,100
need to we need to help provide better

430
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,500
education into I would say or better

431
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,140
more assistance and at a basic level

432
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,360
something that we found both in our live

433
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,600
deployments and in our data set is that

434
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,120
enterprises today are still operating

435
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,160
and let's call it an old school control

436
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,679
model the reality is that endpoint

437
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,260
endpoint detection controlling devices

438
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,320
is a huge part of the alert stack not

439
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,740
not just MDM but nodes and data like

440
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,600
safeguarding data center is all about

441
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,679
the devices that are there that

442
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,740
the campus is filled with devices and

443
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,320
EDR Solutions antivirus Solutions are

444
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,620
some of the most mature log generation

445
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,020
sources that enterprises have today

446
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,179
especially those that have a distributed

447
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,940
campus and so we're coming from this

448
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,940
device or box based sense of control

449
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,039
from Once Upon a Time

450
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,440
before and before cloud

451
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,059
of course we have network controls

452
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,400
network activity the the network pillar

453
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,740
is key devices communicate with one

454
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,140
another through a network and network

455
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,580
controls are fundamentally different

456
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,740
it's not it's not an antivirus it's not

457
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,320
an agent it's not a passive scan what is

458
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,740
it what is what network

459
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,559
controls offer are coming from firewalls

460
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,539
are coming from proxies are coming from

461
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,400
the communications between sources and

462
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,280
destinations clients and servers and

463
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,919
network controls are again coming from

464
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,720
sort of an old school perspective of

465
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,900
firewalls create tons of logs the

466
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,720
classic Enterprise the number two the

467
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,660
first two buckets of alerts that they're

468
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,179
going to have are device based and then

469
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,179
firewall based alerts and of course

470
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,400
why do we have these alerts at the end

471
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,039
of the day it's users it's people it's

472
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,460
identities and alerts based upon logins

473
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,940
authorizations identity authentications

474
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,020
and these three these are three of five

475
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,600
zero trust pillars but those three

476
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,360
pillars account for three quarters of

477
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,520
all alerts in an Enterprise in an

478
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,160
Enterprise sock it's at the end of the

479
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,440
day and I think on the next slide as

480
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,880
well

481
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,840
a way of

482
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,520
conceptualizing the sock control

483
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,700
strategy is we have these three flavors

484
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,559
of Allure

485
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,639
and everything else

486
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,340
there

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,380
so spilling into that a little bit more

488
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,620
is just the the type of device

489
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,140
protections that we've seen the most

490
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,760
um

491
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,520
and

492
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,039
it's I I really can't add much to what

493
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,020
you said so I'm just that's basically

494
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,179
what this is these two slides play into

495
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,299
one another where this is talking about

496
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,460
the analysts protecting caring more

497
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,900
about device protection so what is

498
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,480
device

499
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,159
protection it's

500
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,200
these these endpoints it's the cloud

501
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,659
detections so yeah

502
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,500
I with one note with one note on this

503
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,340
slide that map to zero trust devices

504
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,720
networks and users are where are this

505
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,820
the resources that are primarily covered

506
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,280
by our alert strategy we see a bucket

507
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,740
here that's cloud and that's what it

508
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,539
turns into is that the cloud detections

509
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,640
are fundamentally different they have

510
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,500
only a few types of providers they have

511
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,880
different kinds of assets we're not

512
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
thinking about anti-virus we're not

513
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,080
thinking about classic firewalls and

514
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,400
appliances that are hooked into

515
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,940
networking gear and Cloud by itself is

516
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,720
something of approximately 20 percent of

517
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,480
all detections in the stack so from an

518
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,280
analyst perspective and from a strategic

519
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,760
perspective by mapping to zero trust

520
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,520
we can get classes or buckets of alerts

521
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,440
that themselves can have specialization

522
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,200
Network alerts can be by protocol and we

523
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,120
can stack our alert strategy and

524
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,240
detection strategy by Network in the

525
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,980
networking layer we can have our DNS

526
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,640
alerts HTTP alerts FTP SSH our our

527
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,220
remote desktop and file sharing

528
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,919
protocols or in a hospital or in an

529
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,620
industrial environment protocol based

530
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,480
detections are key

531
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,380
um

532
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,740
cloud is an increasing percentage and

533
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,020
the trends that we have over time as

534
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,240
being a percentage of the alerts and

535
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,620
it's a fundamentally different bucket

536
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,080
than what zero trust is bringing to Bear

537
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,039
for the standard Enterprise

538
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,659
hmm

539
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,840
yeah

540
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,900
so it's just this is just elaborating

541
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,700
further on it it's just talking about

542
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,960
the different Cloud providers and which

543
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,240
one's more predominant

544
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,799
um

545
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,600
the the top takeaways that we wanted you

546
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,799
to get from this is that they the

547
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,020
analysts need more

548
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,059
there's too many Cloud providers out

549
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,280
there not enough analyst knowledge

550
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,500
so we need to we need to work with the

551
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,960
analysts to to get the detections they

552
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,600
need to understand Cloud providers and

553
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,480
honestly we need to start pushing for

554
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,659
for standardization across the cloud

555
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,580
providers it may not be good business

556
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,440
for them but it's great detections for

557
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,059
us

558
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,720
um we it's we've moved on from the days

559
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,679
when

560
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,480
um an analyst just had to understand

561
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,520
windows and then you had one team that

562
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,720
knew windows and one team that knew

563
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,000
Linux right those two would talk to each

564
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
other those days are long gone they also

565
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,000
need to know the cloud set up they need

566
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
to know what to look for they need to

567
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,120
know what credentials

568
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,440
um where credentials shouldn't be

569
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,940
getting stored they they need to know

570
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,620
all these different things

571
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,179
and

572
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,679
um part of our part of the purpose

573
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,080
behind this research is to also be

574
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,700
advocates for the analysts because I

575
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,559
mean that's what a Sim is right it's

576
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,740
supposed to advocate for them and you

577
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,380
can't expect someone to have AWS

578
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,780
knowledge and come in there and work on

579
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,580
gcp detections

580
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,880
and so that's the long long story sorry

581
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,340
that's a very big sticking point for me

582
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,580
is the helping out the analyst and

583
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,679
giving them the visibility that they

584
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,419
needed in the miter framework

585
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,740
you'd look like you wanted to add you're

586
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,580
good and and to add to that for

587
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,679
the result of our interviews and what it

588
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,179
is that we're hearing from customers and

589
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,220
also during alert migration where we're

590
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,260
trying to define the original strategy

591
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,299
what we see is that customers that are

592
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,760
coming that have multiple clouds don't

593
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,280
have a coherent strategy that's one for

594
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,039
one consistent coverage across Cloud

595
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,080
sources gcp has a different set of

596
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,640
controls that have been

597
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,780
custom crafted to AWS workspace controls

598
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,480
are are patchy for organizations

599
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,760
especially after M A that might have

600
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,659
multiple kinds of workspaces for for

601
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:30,059
users that are Global and using

602
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,400
different applications within the org so

603
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,100
at a strategy level there are it's a

604
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,020
patchwork and there are gaps there are

605
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,539
gaps in the cloud coverage and that when

606
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,620
we were looking at the miter attack

607
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,720
mapping we were able to see especially

608
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,000
trapping execution in the cloud was

609
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,919
something that was simply not happening

610
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,080
in the in the control set including the

611
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,059
custom controls including what the msps

612
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,440
were implementing that the the ease of

613
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,779
the E there's something about creating

614
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,779
easy controls that are obvious but if

615
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,279
we're trying to map a strategy that

616
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,620
covers miter attack for example end to

617
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,200
end that taking that coherent strategy

618
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,480
will illustrate in most of the customer

619
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,880
deployments that we saw areas where

620
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,020
there were control gaps and that Mo what

621
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,520
was something that we were surprised to

622
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,580
see is as a ratio of controls how few

623
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,200
were actually related to data

624
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,440
exfiltration data collection and the the

625
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,900
data pillar of zero trust is like well

626
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,400
in some in some models it's at the

627
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,500
center and what are our fundamental

628
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,020
safeguards around data and when we're

629
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,059
looking at visibility analytics and

630
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,179
triggering soar we saw that x controls

631
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,220
around exfiltration and data collection

632
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,559
after we've gotten past the

633
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,919
the perimeter were weak across the board

634
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,940
if in financial services for msps so

635
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,860
we're we understand and what's changed

636
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,080
in our Innovation portfolio what

637
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,880
detections we're going to create are to

638
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,340
help to fill in these gaps in visibility

639
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,679
that the analysts are naturally having

640
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,740
as well as the msps to help to help

641
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,100
enable our MSP partner strategy

642
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,840
thank you

643
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,360
um I'm going to have to speed through

644
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,059
some of these things

645
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:20,220
if I skim over something that y'all that

646
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,900
people really did want to see just just

647
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,580
stop me this thing is about as informal

648
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,860
as you can get and if you don't like

649
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,200
informal that's fine it's formal don't

650
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,559
worry about it we're good all right so

651
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,679
um alert management all right so this

652
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,200
graph the purpose of this graph is to

653
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,500
highlight a couple things one is in the

654
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,279
Devo sock report we we questioned about

655
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,640
many different things you can go to

656
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
soccer port and see what we what the

657
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,820
different types of questions are in apps

658
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,840
you can tell I don't remember them

659
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
offhand but um the important thing that

660
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,880
we wanted you to grab are the two ones

661
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,200
that are highlighted up here about alert

662
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,200
management so the one on the left is

663
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
alert management was critical to to high

664
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,380
performance High performing stocks

665
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,179
um some way to manage all of their

666
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,700
alerts and the one on the right is

667
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,000
showing that management inside of high

668
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,299
performance stocks management

669
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:20,220
doesn't care as much as analysts so the

670
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,480
analysts need alert management

671
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,039
management

672
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,140
isn't too concerned about it nearly as

673
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,000
concerned as we would want them to be

674
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,279
and if your management just reverse it

675
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,960
you'll be happy

676
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,559
um

677
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,559
everything's good all right so

678
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,659
we needed to also establish a baseline

679
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,220
some of you may or may not know what

680
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,159
zero trust is bada bing here it is it's

681
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,980
off the sizza zero trust maturity model

682
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,960
2021.

683
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,220
um I would tell you what page to look at

684
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,340
but I forget uh the the important thing

685
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,340
behind this one is to know that there's

686
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,380
another step in there as David had

687
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,820
pointed out where you should add the Sim

688
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,740
in there

689
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,520
um

690
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,380
and going back to the other things that

691
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,779
we were talking about uh about the

692
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,279
various pillars and what we were missing

693
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,799
this this is what we're referencing

694
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,380
um and as a note so we're coming from

695
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,200
Devo and Devo is a Sim provider many of

696
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,580
our customers are using it as a data

697
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,799
Lake to enable visibility and analytics

698
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,779
for infrastructure for application

699
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,539
performance monitoring for devices and

700
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,059
machine data data Lake use case primary

701
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,440
use case secondary use cases actually

702
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,000
generating security decision making in

703
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,760
action based upon a functioning data

704
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,779
lake with full visibility so Devo is a

705
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,640
visibility and analytics foundational

706
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,980
layer or that's what we operate as

707
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,320
assume and we integrate with something

708
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
like 500 vendor products that are

709
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,140
covering the pillars of xero trust the

710
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,380
the endpoint device

711
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,200
protection vendor products are feeding

712
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,820
into our visibility and analytics

713
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,679
platform so

714
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,539
the coverage that we have across vendor

715
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,520
products is from a visibility and

716
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,880
analytics perspective and fundamentally

717
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,520
we were able to see that the

718
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,340
across all functioning organizations all

719
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,140
pillars are represented but we saw

720
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,960
weaknesses with data data and in Cloud

721
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,059
protecting the application workload

722
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,320
thank you

723
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,539
um all right so

724
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:28,500
here we're just trying to show you that

725
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,100
um

726
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,620
when we when we talk about the various

727
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,740
alerts we we notice that

728
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,659
um in Cloud detections there were more

729
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,039
concerned the analysts were more

730
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,140
concerned with with visibility you know

731
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,480
what can I see

732
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,580
um who's doing what things like that but

733
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,440
in Enterprises are more concerned about

734
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,299
device connections which would make

735
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,460
sense you know what I mean

736
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,140
um so

737
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,580
it's just trying to show you the the

738
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,159
criticality or the importance of what

739
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,840
your detection should be going for and

740
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,100
what kind of detection you should be

741
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,779
looking at based off of what your

742
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,880
analyst

743
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,760
where where your resources lie

744
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,539
um

745
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,640
actually another another note about this

746
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,399
is what's different between Cloud

747
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,740
control and traditional Enterprise

748
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,860
control is being very clear that the

749
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,179
traditional Enterprise is thinking about

750
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,779
devices and yes in Cloud we can think of

751
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,899
we can think of containers and VMS as

752
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,179
being devices we can think of every node

753
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,039
in our architectural map as being

754
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,799
devices and that's accurate but the

755
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,960
device Focus for actual controls and

756
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
detections is doesn't even come close to

757
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,399
the traditional Enterprise dealing with

758
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,080
MDM dealing with workstations and

759
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,419
dealing with the the iot so devices are

760
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,419
fourth in mind for cloud defense and the

761
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,320
and a cloud sock and then we see a very

762
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,020
real difference in workload protection

763
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,020
and trapping the run time on all

764
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,820
endpoints is an expensive undertaking

765
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,860
for a traditional Enterprise and

766
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,779
impossible across iot and unmanaged

767
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,020
devices but in the cloud where we have

768
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,299
let's say better access to runtime or

769
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,220
more consistent access to runtime we're

770
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,320
able to generate workload detections

771
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,720
we're able to

772
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,179
build native detections for application

773
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,840
monitoring and application control

774
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,580
regardless at the end of the day by the

775
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,860
time and we see it in our in migrations

776
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,080
as well by the time we've managed to

777
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,899
deploy our device protections and

778
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,960
network detections where we're losing

779
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,919
steam by at the end of the actual goal

780
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,520
of protecting the data so we need more

781
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,820
controls more detections that are

782
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,740
designed to safeguard prevent the

783
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,840
exfiltration of data prevent collection

784
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,020
of data within within the corporate

785
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,340
networks cloud or not

786
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,520
thank you

787
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,299
so

788
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,899
the other thing to to consider is

789
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,260
there really is and David helped me help

790
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,880
show me when we were preparing for this

791
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,559
presentation really brought us to mind

792
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,140
is that Financial Services aren't

793
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,779
Financial Services they're technology

794
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,779
companies in the financial industry

795
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,700
um and so when you're looking at

796
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,539
detections or you're you're trying to

797
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,220
um Target this this area then

798
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,600
as you can see that they're moving right

799
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,539
in line with technology between

800
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,279
Enterprise and cloud detections and they

801
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,080
actually have a lot more Cloud

802
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
detections than what you would think

803
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,039
being in the financial services right so

804
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,620
I don't know about you but ignorantly I

805
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,419
always like to think that my bank is is

806
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:51,059
somewhere in a nice little area that

807
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,860
they control and everybody's happy but

808
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,799
in reality it's somewhere in wherever

809
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,279
USA on a server farm so it more and more

810
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,980
of your financial services are going to

811
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,600
the cloud

812
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,700
um one of the biggest things we want to

813
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,520
talk about was logging per vendor

814
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,560
um one thing that I did find out

815
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,599
yesterday I was speaking with we were

816
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,060
speaking with Melinda marks over at Tech

817
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,599
Target I think yeah Tech Target and she

818
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,460
said that through their service we're

819
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,219
able to to drill down to get more data

820
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,379
about each one of the cloud service

821
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,699
providers AWS Google cloud or Azure

822
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,440
this is something that I put off that we

823
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,418
pulled off from from websites is trying

824
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:36,239
to understand you know what do they

825
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,560
offer

826
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,339
um

827
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:41,820
again Cloud you can see right here the

828
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,379
disparity in what's offered between the

829
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,199
various providers it's it's annoying and

830
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,239
it's also hard for you to drill down to

831
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,179
be able to find what you you need to

832
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,199
audit right you don't know what you

833
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,000
don't know so sorry I could spend

834
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,339
forever on that one too all right so the

835
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,380
key takeaways in I am already over time

836
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,060
so I'm going to race through I think

837
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,800
we're almost done anyway

838
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,720
um out of the box detections are key in

839
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,540
stock automation so I in other words

840
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,700
you're supposed to

841
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,560
you need something that provides you

842
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,859
detections written for your cloud

843
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:16,440
provider written like gcp AWS whatever

844
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,960
you need those detections already built

845
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,579
into your sim to help your analysts and

846
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:21,839
make sure they don't start off from

847
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,119
ground zero so whatever you're looking

848
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,640
for you need to have those out of the

849
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,500
box detections now I I could sell you

850
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,839
our product but that's not my job

851
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,880
um but yeah so that's one of the key

852
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,460
takeaways and uh yeah I think I took

853
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,280
care of the other one so boom

854
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,280
right we're good yeah this is just the

855
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,540
stuff that you're supposed to learn from

856
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,599
here well um

857
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,760
five takeaways and Five Lessons Learned

858
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
during the course of This research the

859
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,500
first one was that cloud was big and we

860
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,260
were surprised at how many detections

861
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,820
Enterprises were using especially in

862
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,099
financial services to cover Cloud we

863
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,619
were surprised to see one in four socks

864
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,900
that a majority of their detection stack

865
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,640
was cloud-based safeguarding

866
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,740
infrastructure and workspaces and we can

867
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,020
expect those to continue to grow that

868
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,980
cloud

869
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,599
eventually dwarfs Data Center and campus

870
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,500
for coverage and control coverage

871
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,200
we became extra sensitive to the concept

872
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,859
of augmenting the analysts to Innovation

873
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,900
outputs from this research were machine

874
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,000
learning classifiers for zero trust and

875
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,119
for miter attack labeling and what we

876
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,000
hope for those product Innovations is to

877
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,280
augment analysts regardless of what

878
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,839
their alerts are what the results are

879
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,720
and what their data sources are with the

880
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,780
additional enrichments that help to

881
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,000
frame a strategy for both zero trust

882
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,099
coverage as well as miter attack end to

883
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,040
end practically

884
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,619
we discovered that there are five kinds

885
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,839
of detections that socks are actually

886
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,839
implementing cloud is its own distinct

887
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,220
bucket and that of course devices

888
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,560
networks and users has zero trust

889
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,440
pillars form the vast majority of alerts

890
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,680
in all Enterprises that we have a

891
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,500
shortage of protections for application

892
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,619
workloads at least at a seam visibility

893
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,380
layer that defending the runtime is a

894
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,920
weakness that applications of workloads

895
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,859
need further control and of course at

896
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,020
the end of the day data

897
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,599
and preventing exfiltration controlling

898
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,579
for data collection will help reduce

899
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,579
impact and that enterprises need to

900
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:41,339
shore up the last the final stages

901
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:44,660
before impact actually occurs

902
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,760
out of the box for the win we see it

903
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,119
clearly for cloud that the extra for

904
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,680
multiple reasons the extra complexity

905
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,599
the skills required the challenges of

906
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,220
multiple providers and different

907
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,339
vocabularies that out of the box

908
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:01,020
boilerplate detective strategy where you

909
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,480
can essentially piece together a

910
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,619
strategy

911
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,500
as opposed to individual alerts is the

912
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,800
best way to to support alert management

913
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,500
instead of having 400 random alerts we

914
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,140
have five buckets with a coherent view

915
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,720
mapped to zero trust with pillars

916
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,300
clearly defined and mapped with miter

917
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,760
attack in a way that end to end provides

918
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,760
a coherent strategy for coverage and

919
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,880
future developments

920
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,339
using a strategy is crucial and having a

921
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,859
strategy at the end of the day a focus

922
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,380
for our research was interoperability we

923
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,540
have a in an Ideal World with

924
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,400
interoperability let's say for our

925
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,320
medical records we go to One hospital we

926
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,420
go to the clinic we go to another state

927
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,579
and our records are able to transfer and

928
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,320
make the round trip and be enriched at

929
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,260
every stage and what it is we're far

930
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,320
from that with seams shifting from uh

931
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,500
from datadog to Splunk to Sentinel to

932
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,460
devote back and forth uh we're we're far

933
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,099
from transpiling our queries for mapping

934
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,980
alerts on a one-to-one basis but what we

935
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,980
can do is we can we can aggregate our

936
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,839
alerts in a way that has a coherent

937
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,480
bucketed strategy and we can migrate our

938
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,740
strategy

939
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,560
and this is what it is that was a

940
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,300
practical output for our actual

941
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,000
customers that put our Research into

942
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,560
actually moving the needle in our

943
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,140
business processes to make migrations

944
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,160
faster to enable alert Management in a

945
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,960
coherent way and then to have

946
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,480
specializations within analysts that

947
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,099
analysts might come from a network

948
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,500
security background and therefore be

949
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,240
better suited for Network alerts or

950
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,099
coming from a cloud background focusing

951
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:46,079
on cloud alerts and to enable

952
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,700
specialization within the sock

953
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,079
so

954
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,839
uh we went five minutes over uh I

955
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,180
apologize

956
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,579
no we're five minutes over it's we're

957
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,740
supposed to stop at 11 35.

958
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,520
um

959
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,820
we I'm I'm available we both will be

960
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,619
available uh out there if you have any

961
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,380
questions there's a young lady uh boom

962
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,000
cast Tess

963
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,720
what yeah her caslin she's uh she needs

964
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,640
interviews for a podcast so look her up

965
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,560
good questions just trying to get word

966
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,060
out about this conference

967
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,880
um if if I if we can do anything to help

968
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,980
if I can answer any questions since I do

969
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,780
do the detections and I know I didn't

970
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,720
talk much at all about that feel free to

971
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,980
see us and whoever the speakers are for

972
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,560
the next one that's on me my bad

973
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,280
um all right we're good

974
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,579
[Applause]
