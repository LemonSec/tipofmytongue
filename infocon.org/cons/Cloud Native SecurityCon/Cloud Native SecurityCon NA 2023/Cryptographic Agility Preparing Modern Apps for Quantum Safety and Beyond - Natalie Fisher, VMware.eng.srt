1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
so good morning my name is Natalie

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,940
Fisher I am a product manager at VMware

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,280
in the office of the CTO

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,580
and first I have a question how many

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,660
people here are crypto agility experts

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,359
you guys have volunteered to answer any

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,939
questions thank you very much

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,560
um I'm just kidding obviously but the

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,820
reason that I do mention that is because

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,160
this is a 101 session so

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,539
I want to make sure that you guys aren't

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,880
disappointed by the topics that we're

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,479
covering today

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,579
so why don't we get started I'm going to

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,800
go over the agenda really quickly we're

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,880
going to talk about what is

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,860
cryptographic agility why is it

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,140
important why do you even care about

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,840
this and some suggestions on how to

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,700
prepare and then I'm going to give a

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,360
quick uh overview of what vmware's plans

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,219
are

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,680
and because I'm doing the VMware plans

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,260
are required disclaimer don't purchase

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,059
anything

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,039
don't you know buy more VMware stock

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:02,820
because you think something super

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,260
awesome is going to happen because this

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,040
may or may not occur

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,479
so the first area that we are going to

31
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,200
cover is what is cryptographic agility

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,920
so crypto agility is defined as the

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,740
ability of security systems to be able

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,640
to rapidly switch between algorithms

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,080
cryptographic Primitives and other

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
encryption mechanisms without the rest

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,979
of the system's infrastructure being

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,500
significantly affected and this is

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,659
especially important when it's in

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,079
response to changes in security needs or

41
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,880
invulnerabilities

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,280
essentially it's the ability for an

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,259
organization to have complete control

44
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,720
over its cryptographic mechanisms and

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,299
processes without involving intense

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,880
manual effort

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,860
so what are the advantages of being

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,680
cryptographically agile

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
one is the ability to more easily

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,899
transition to new algorithms as they

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,939
have been created

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,979
change your libraries on existing

53
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,899
implementations when new features or

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,459
algorithms have been added

55
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,560
modify key configuration parameters

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,680
without having to make adjustments to

57
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,200
your architecture

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,120
having the ability to retire and

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,000
deprecate algorithms without making a

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,420
significant impact as well

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,700
compliance standards so this isn't just

62
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,220
about being able to easily standardize

63
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,020
your compliance and security across your

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,780
Enterprise but it's also the ability to

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,000
easily migrate your crypto from Define

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,560
to Define standards such as fips or ISO

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,140
and of course remediate your libraries

68
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,180
when issues or vulnerabilities are

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,260
discovered

70
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,540
and it's important because cryptography

71
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,540
is a critical aspect of security and

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,160
it's often necessary to update the

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,980
algorithms used in response to advances

74
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,280
made in cryptography such as new attacks

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,440
or discovery of weaknesses to existing

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,879
algorithms

77
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,700
it's going to allow you to also improve

78
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,500
your overall security and resilience

79
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,480
so let's take a look at what is the most

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,760
common architecture setup in the current

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,840
landscape

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,940
so today the majority of Enterprise

83
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,340
systems have their cryptography so

84
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,040
deeply embedded in their systems and

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,500
their applications that it's

86
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,159
increasingly hard to make changes and

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
the reason is because back in the day

88
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,440
when crypto was initially created

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
it was simply used and it was acceptable

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,780
to hard code into the operating systems

91
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,700
themselves which of course makes it near

92
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,799
impossible to make changes

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,280
and a great or not so great example of

94
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,599
this is when um a large problem of

95
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,299
vulnerability called Heartbleed uh came

96
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,640
to came to be if you will if you aren't

97
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,099
familiar with Heartbleed it was a

98
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,319
security bug found in open SSL

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,900
cryptography Library which is a widely

100
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,680
used implementation of the TLs protocol

101
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,080
and that vulnerability allowed an

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,380
attacker to not only capture credentials

103
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,899
but also read the memory of the system

104
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,660
such as emails and keys and transaction

105
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,320
data and this was discovered in 2012 and

106
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,120
we all know how quickly things move in

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
security particularly in the verticals

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,479
of secure of government and health care

109
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,259
and it was patched finally around 2014

110
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,479
and then organizations had a couple of

111
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,120
options right they had the option to

112
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,940
either replace the open SSL libraries

113
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,460
with the patched versions of them or the

114
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,699
second option was to replace them

115
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,820
altogether however both options are kind

116
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,720
of difficult because many organizations

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,139
lacked the visibility into where openssl

118
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,699
was being used throughout their

119
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,340
environments and not only that but

120
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,020
because it took so long and it was so

121
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,180
difficult a lot of organizations were

122
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,400
incredibly slow to respond and so

123
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
hackers managed to actually steal about

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,180
four and a half million Health Care

125
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,180
records and even in 2019 over 200 000

126
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,639
systems were still unpatched

127
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,500
so you might be thinking to yourself you

128
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,199
know WTF or why was it so hard or maybe

129
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,400
you're not wondering that because you

130
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,020
know why it was so hard

131
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,720
and maybe you're thinking this was a

132
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
huge distraction for the engineering

133
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
teams

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,400
um having to fight fires because

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
something was insecure in their

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
vulnerabilities

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,340
to be fair right

138
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,500
it's difficult to change or update

139
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,400
protocols for a variety of reasons

140
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,539
especially when you're not set up to do

141
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,740
so

142
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,780
one of the areas that I kind of talked

143
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,340
about was being aware of your encryption

144
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,560
and what you're using which applications

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,440
are using it or how it's actually being

146
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,940
used

147
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,820
so you have that lack of visibility

148
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,919
there's no unification there's no

149
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,740
unified way for customers to transition

150
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,979
between cryptography standards keys and

151
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,860
certificates libraries things of that

152
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,180
nature

153
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,960
and this is one of the hardest ones

154
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,340
re-architecturing is required

155
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,860
to date to make changes often cost

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,259
hundreds of developer hours as it may

157
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,440
require re-architecturing portions of an

158
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,240
application because if things are

159
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,780
hard-coded then the apps in the crypto

160
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,259
are specifically working with a

161
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,539
particular API that's used in that

162
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,860
implementation

163
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,319
and that means that any changes to

164
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,440
crypto will require

165
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,600
complete changes in the app itself and

166
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,460
it's highly unlikely that the new

167
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,620
versions of the app in crypto are going

168
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,660
to be compatible with any of the Legacy

169
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,000
versions that exist and of course

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,220
anytime you have to do anything manually

171
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,020
is incredibly time consuming and

172
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,819
error-prone

173
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,560
and there's more

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,080
so the current landscape doesn't take

175
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,120
into consideration all the different

176
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
stakeholders that are involved and if

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,479
you're not too familiar with

178
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,520
cryptography I don't want to make it

179
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,259
sound like nothing exists

180
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,440
obviously something exists right the

181
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
traditional building blocks show that

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,300
organizations have a layer that is

183
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,460
represented by Engineers developers Etc

184
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,440
that are responsible for the platforms

185
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,300
and will be updating the libraries

186
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,440
themselves

187
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,139
but what is missing from the story are

188
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,180
the other stakeholders for the

189
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,460
Enterprises the framework is missing for

190
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,199
the operations teams and by the

191
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,360
operation teams I mean the top green box

192
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,979
right there for Enterprise consumers

193
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,259
looking at the infosec the it

194
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,240
infrastructure teams and things of that

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,620
nature

196
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,539
and

197
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,000
um they work with the green box right

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,740
they work with the developers or

199
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,479
Engineers to

200
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,940
um for the changes which takes time or

201
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,800
sometimes developers have to make

202
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
decisions on when things have to be

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,220
patched and I don't want you guys to

204
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,780
misunderstand what I'm saying of course

205
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,840
developers need crypto but the

206
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,259
consumption of that cryptography

207
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:20,180
and management needs to be

208
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,199
operationalized and so the other

209
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,819
stakeholders that I'm mentioning at the

210
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,080
top are just as important as the to be

211
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
part of that process if you will

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,919
so

213
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,719
because you have to think about like how

214
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,059
does an entire organization come to

215
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,839
understand their cryptography footprint

216
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,940
how do organizations transition to new

217
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,919
algorithms and standards

218
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,480
so we also need to have to take in

219
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,740
consideration these other consumers

220
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
so let's move on to Future landscape

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,180
while it's true that we do have

222
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,000
some some agility in our cryptography

223
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,820
for example many os vendors such as

224
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,399
Microsoft and Google have agility

225
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,040
integrated into their software update

226
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,860
process which comes in place of you know

227
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,800
you downloading large packets of data

228
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,920
and rebooting your system

229
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,060
but for the future if you kind of

230
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,880
imagine it this way it's a world where

231
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,100
the crypto agile framework is

232
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,779
independent from the app lifecycle

233
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,860
itself

234
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,899
so it's simpler to manage your

235
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,640
application and your cryptography

236
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,100
transition configuration and compliance

237
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,260
without having to rewrite your

238
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,480
application or to reboot or reset your

239
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,899
infrastructure

240
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,339
so there's additional benefits to this

241
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,200
right it means that

242
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,459
um you know how crypto is being used of

243
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,420
course right you're going to have that

244
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,180
visibility you are also it's also going

245
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,800
to be easy to do standards migration

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,899
like I talked about regarding fips and

247
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,279
ISO

248
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,440
it also means it's going to be easier to

249
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,200
meet your compliance requirements and

250
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
establish clear policies around crypto

251
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,580
and best practices

252
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,899
and it's going to encourage good

253
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,300
engineering practices most developers

254
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,240
aren't Security Experts so

255
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
once all the stakeholders as I had

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,959
mentioned in the previous slide have

257
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,339
gained visibility over their

258
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,380
cryptographic infrastructure they can

259
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,860
now replace their outdated crypto as

260
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,380
necessary and along with instilling some

261
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,519
automation as well

262
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,519
so I know that was kind of a lot but now

263
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,820
it's kind of why do I really care

264
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,000
so obviously crypto is everywhere right

265
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,399
it's used every time you make an online

266
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,760
purchase it is used anytime you do

267
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,440
online banking and transactions every

268
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,360
time you open your phone and use an app

269
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,940
it's there it's always working in the

270
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,160
background it secures all transmitted

271
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,220
information in our iot world and it's

272
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,839
working there to authenticate people to

273
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,680
devices the device to devices Etc

274
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,660
another reason to make sure that you

275
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,279
understand and Care is because of

276
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,779
implementation flaws right so

277
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,940
um here I have like these three images

278
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,380
to kind of represent some of the really

279
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,899
big ones that are pretty well known the

280
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,399
first one is the heartbeat example that

281
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,820
I gave earlier the other two are Specter

282
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,100
and meltdown both of which are

283
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,579
classified as side Channel attacks and

284
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,079
there are other forms of slide Channel

285
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,120
attacks and can I just say that I really

286
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,579
love the logos that they create I'm just

287
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,899
gonna throw that out there I think

288
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,060
they're super cute I really like Specter

289
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,579
okay moving on so other forms of side

290
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,920
Channel attacks include timing attacks

291
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,560
right where the observable movement of

292
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,500
data in and out of memory betrays just

293
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,320
enough information about the secret keys

294
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,420
to narrow down the potential range of

295
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,940
keys which means Brute Force guessing is

296
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,560
a pretty practical way to kind of figure

297
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,600
things out

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,700
um but the point is here that we can go

299
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,040
on and on and on about what could be

300
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,380
found what has been found what will be

301
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,180
found but the reason that you really

302
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,399
should care is because do you really

303
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,740
want to stay take two plus years

304
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,899
to update your vulnerable systems

305
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,160
because you aren't cryptographically

306
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,640
agile

307
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,800
another big one of course is quantum

308
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,579
Computing so squail scaled quantum

309
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,880
computers can break our encryption

310
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,380
quantum computers are getting more and

311
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,040
more powerful and it's really exciting

312
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,660
and it's awesome to see in our

313
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,860
technology world but it's bad for um but

314
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,240
it's bad because it can break your

315
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,120
encryption on most Enterprises and

316
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,820
digital infrastructures and things that

317
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,620
economies are relying on which would

318
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,660
basically render today's encryption

319
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,660
methods pretty useless

320
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,839
so you may think that's fun we can just

321
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,820
let future Natalie or insert your name

322
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,339
here deal with that and worry about it

323
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,779
however

324
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,519
you don't have that much time right

325
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,380
because it's not like Quantum Computing

326
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,079
is like a decade away and on top of that

327
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,120
there's a type of attack called Harvest

328
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,100
now decrypt later

329
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,440
where it's essentially this attack where

330
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,779
the bad the bad actor collects the

331
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,940
encrypted data and holds on to it

332
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,680
waiting for the point in time that

333
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,940
they're able is going to be able to

334
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,579
decrypt that information which can be

335
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,440
things like

336
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,959
you know Trade Secrets government

337
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,420
agencies Social Security numbers but I

338
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,380
mean everyone's Social Security numbers

339
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,459
out there but you know what I'm trying

340
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,699
to say

341
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
so I know this all sounds pretty bad

342
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,200
um but I also kind of want to emphasize

343
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,260
on how important all of this is and for

344
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,420
the threat of quantum Computing for the

345
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,240
last five years nist has been working on

346
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,180
new standards and

347
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,980
um that are resistant to the types of

348
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,200
quantum Computing and these new

349
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,660
algorithms are called pqc or

350
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,959
post-quantum cryptography and you don't

351
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,260
need a quantum computer to make use of

352
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,139
and it's gone okay and it's back you

353
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,120
don't have to make you don't need a

354
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,339
quantum computer to make use of these

355
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,839
algorithms

356
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,360
but we will have to transition our

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,860
existing applications and our

358
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,320
infrastructure to support them

359
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,019
and while there are draft standards out

360
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,760
there they are of course going to be

361
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,339
updated more will be added to it that

362
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,860
process is going to continue on

363
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,019
um and then of course last year a

364
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,899
memorandum around pqc was released

365
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,399
because of the critical security

366
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,800
implications and the magnitude of the

367
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,079
effort that's going to be required to

368
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,699
switch to new algorithms which

369
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,199
Enterprises will need to comply to

370
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,380
so how do you prepare

371
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,639
for what I've clearly outlined is like

372
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,680
totally the end of the world

373
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,839
um so

374
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,660
I want you to put your head between your

375
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,120
legs and kiss what you think is strong

376
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,399
cryptography goodbye

377
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,860
obviously I'm kidding but it's going to

378
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,720
make RSA 4096 look like route 13.

379
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,579
so

380
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,860
from this talk you've learned that being

381
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,680
crypto agile is complex and it will

382
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,860
require a multi-faceted approach

383
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,079
and to prepare your organization to be

384
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,120
agile these are a few suggestions

385
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,920
number one you're going to want to

386
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,560
inventory and identify all your crypto

387
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,600
resources such as certificates Keys

388
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,880
algorithms libraries Etc try to group

389
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,500
them logically by expiration dates for

390
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,079
certificates for example you want to

391
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,480
communicate your organization policies

392
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,459
with your internal and external

393
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,699
stakeholders and provide ample Education

394
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,180
and Training on what these policies are

395
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,720
you also want to identify your most

396
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,480
valuable assets and have plans on how to

397
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,100
secure them

398
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,620
and then plan and build for change

399
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,579
because big changes like adoption of pqc

400
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,079
aren't the only problem that you're

401
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
going to be running into even changing

402
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
your applications to support changing

403
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,440
compliance is also going to get value

404
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,899
from being crypto agile

405
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,240
you also want to create backup plans for

406
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,459
certificate Authority compromise so

407
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,800
being able to arrange with alternate

408
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,560
vendors and having the ability to carry

409
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,180
out quick CA migration

410
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,399
now I'm going to talk about what VMware

411
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,500
is actually going to be doing and the

412
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,540
project that we've been working on

413
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,040
so there is a project called project

414
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,540
Newcastle

415
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,139
and it is a policy driven approach to

416
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,540
implementing cryptographic agility in

417
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,820
Secure communication contexts and the

418
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,160
goal is to support cryptographic library

419
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,620
extensibility and the ability for

420
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,300
internal and external customers to

421
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,459
create their own policies so the project

422
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,380
is looking to support these five areas

423
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,779
which I've talked fairly extensively

424
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:58,940
about right

425
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,160
the observability component which is to

426
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,380
understand what crypto what crypto is

427
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,980
being used and how and where being able

428
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,220
to Define your cryptography policies and

429
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,079
having that ability to install and

430
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,540
Implement that cryptography without

431
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,059
having to reinstall or reboot your

432
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,059
systems automate your reconfiguration so

433
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,459
being able to change libraries out when

434
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,380
they are updated

435
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,839
um support pqc transition because I've

436
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,280
talked pretty extensively about why

437
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,600
that's important and that will be

438
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,679
important in the next coming couple

439
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,620
years and then of course to audit and

440
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,400
attest cryptographic compliance

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,880
so that is actually it

442
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,740
I put some chat gbt jokes up here

443
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,299
because I think they're funny okay I

444
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,640
think some of them are funny I

445
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,500
particularly like the yoga one and the

446
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,059
banner

447
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,740
um and because I kind of feel like this

448
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,799
talk is very you know intense so

449
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,700
wanted to not make it not exciting

450
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
um and then

451
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,900
QR code if you even remotely liked my

452
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,059
talk and enjoyed my jokes and if you

453
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,620
didn't here's my dog don't look at the

454
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,100
QR code

455
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,380
and that's it

456
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,480
um I hope you guys have a really awesome

457
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,980
time at the rest of the convention

458
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,909
[Applause]

459
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,380
they are open for questions but yes

460
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,380
yesterday

461
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,918
okay

462
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,299
for pqc

463
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,520
yeah so just in case nobody heard him

464
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,620
the first question was

465
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,200
um are people starting to look into how

466
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,480
to solve this problem and start becoming

467
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,039
more crypto agile and then the second

468
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,500
question was what is what do I believe

469
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,380
the timing will be for pqc to become a

470
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,260
thing if you will so the first answer to

471
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,140
your question is yes there are a lot of

472
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,280
companies out there that are actually

473
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,220
starting to sell uh ways to become make

474
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,600
to make your environment more crypto

475
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,980
agile so this is definitely something

476
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,360
that has been in the works for quite a

477
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,580
while it's actually uh some research

478
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,200
that's been done on for like over 10

479
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
years where people have tried to figure

480
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,740
out how can we do this and how can we

481
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,480
improve the way that we manage our

482
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
security infrastructure so definitely

483
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,780
yes for that second one in regards to

484
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,940
when will Quantum Computing endanger us

485
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,380
and kill us all

486
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,980
um

487
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,660
there's a lot of arguments and

488
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,660
discussion along that line but we're

489
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,460
probably looking at about five to eight

490
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,299
years

491
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,160
I had jokingly said a decade because

492
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
that was what people said five years ago

493
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,280
so we're looking probably about 20 28.

494
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,080
is what we're looking at yes

495
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,520
yeah

496
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,120
no

497
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,020
that the last thing yeah because Quantum

498
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,039
Computing is also going to mess with

499
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,140
that as well

500
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,120
it is a big that's why I kind of made

501
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,160
that joke about the whole raw 13 thing

502
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,340
right guys it's like things that you

503
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,440
thought were super secure are no longer

504
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,539
secure you are not allowed to have

505
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,640
questions because you are an expert but

506
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,120
go ahead

507
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,260
oh

508
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,720
sure so we don't have any so VMware

509
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,039
itself doesn't have anything right now

510
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,960
not to try to sell our oh God this is

511
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,240
recorded not to sell our products like

512
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,580
not seller products but um there are

513
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,620
other companies that are doing that now

514
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,960
but what we are planning to do in terms

515
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,340
of what we're going to be implementing

516
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,140
you won't need to implement something

517
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,600
brand new the hope the hope is that'll

518
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,280
end up being more of a plug-in to your

519
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,500
existing uh security infrastructure is

520
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,240
the goal

521
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,559
yeah yes

522
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,100
forever

523
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,480
yeah

524
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,580
I mean

525
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,939
a lot of them

526
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,200
the only issue is like how do you

527
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,640
sort of like trust them

528
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,620
yeah so that's a really good question I

529
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,760
don't know if everyone heard that but

530
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,080
he's basically asking how do you trust

531
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
new things that come out

532
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,120
much like anything new that comes out

533
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,340
um I mean unfortunately it's hard to say

534
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,440
because I feel like it's gonna have to

535
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,720
follow like standard um sdlc in the

536
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,460
sense of like testing it making sure it

537
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,900
works in your

538
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,240
um your beta or your test environments

539
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,960
prior to deploying to GA but

540
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,280
I mean this is going to be new for all

541
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,799
of us right it's not like anyone has

542
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,000
already solved all these problems and

543
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
they're hoarding it maybe they are but

544
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,600
not that I know of

545
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,740
um so it's just going to be a journey

546
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,940
that we're going to take as a security

547
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,299
community

548
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,360
running back

549
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,900
I feel like this also kind of goes back

550
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,299
to your first question

551
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,980
right like how do you trust something

552
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,600
that's going to be new and that's going

553
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,020
to exist and I think it's kind of going

554
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,299
to be like you know how when devops

555
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,400
first started and you had your cic

556
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,900
pipeline and it's kind of like how are

557
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,039
we going to do this why is this taking

558
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
so long and now it's pretty easy to

559
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,720
change stuff out I kind of see it sort

560
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,700
of going in that direction where it's

561
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,500
like it's just going to take time to get

562
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,720
there but we'll get there because we

563
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,320
kind of have to

564
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,199
yes

565
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,880
you're not going to like any of my

566
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,179
answers

567
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,480
but yes yeah so I mean that's that's

568
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,980
kind of the problem I think with like

569
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,419
that's what everyone's kind of fear is

570
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,280
about the whole Quantum Computing that's

571
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,000
going to be happening

572
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,380
I think it's going to be more about

573
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,059
specific vulnerabilities to be honest

574
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,940
with you yeah but you know

575
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,580
experts I know he jokingly was an expert

576
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,580
but yeah

577
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,500
yeah

578
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,240
so he is an expert and doesn't really

579
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,860
want to answer questions that's totally

580
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,240
cool too

581
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,780
yes

582
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,159
yeah so that's also a really good

583
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,240
question

584
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,140
um

585
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,059
the answer is both so I've met with

586
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,000
quite a bit of customers and they wanna

587
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,380
they're they're they are concerned about

588
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,940
the nist protocols particularly on the

589
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,799
federal side

590
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,140
um they're very concerned about it but

591
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,179
they do want it they but crypto agility

592
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,159
is definitely high on their list at

593
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,780
least for the FED offices that we've

594
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,520
spoken with because

595
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
they're they're concerned about

596
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,820
expediency on being able to to support

597
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,039
what's going to come down the pipeline

598
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,360
and

599
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,100
I didn't want to say this part because I

600
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,720
felt like I already sort of was like Hey

601
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,880
the world's on fire right

602
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,500
um but people are already harvesting

603
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,640
data

604
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,260
and they're just kind of keeping it and

605
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,299
waiting right like that's the legit

606
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,080
thing that's happening

607
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,159
yeah

608
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,140
I did not expect to get any questions so

609
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,980
this is kind of fun

610
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,059
um anything else

611
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,140
I didn't think my presentation was going

612
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,760
to run so quick but I guess I talk

613
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,299
really fast

614
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,179
okay cool thanks feel free to come find

615
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,539
me later
