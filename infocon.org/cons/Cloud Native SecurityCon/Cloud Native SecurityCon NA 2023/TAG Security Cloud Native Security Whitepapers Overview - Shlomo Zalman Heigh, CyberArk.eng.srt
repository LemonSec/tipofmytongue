00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,940
but first

19
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,980
a little bit a little bit about me

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,239
um used for securing machine identity

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,699
and in Cloud environments and my role

25
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,219
aside from regular feature development

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,660
on the product

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,860
engage with open source community and

28
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,700
lots of Upstream contributions

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,040
specifically to philosophy projects and

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,659
tax security which is what brings me

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,000
here and my spare time I like to spend

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,380
time with my wife and four-year-old

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,200
daughter I tinker with 3D printing fly

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,900
RC planes and woodworking projects and

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm always happy to connect with new

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,720
people you can find me on LinkedIn and

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,659
GitHub the links are on the slide or you

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,460
can come talk to me afterwards I'm here

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,040
until the end

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,600
um and I've been involved with the tax

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,840
security for about a year now I think I

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
got more involved after this last

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,100
kubecon in Detroit where I got to meet a

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,900
lot of the members in person which

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,820
really helped jump start that and I I

46
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,320
really like that these conferences allow

47
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,299
us to meet people in person and

48
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,280
understand how we can get involved it's

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,360
very it's a very different meeting

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,759
people on a get up issue as opposed to

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,979
at a conference in person so I really

52
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,380
appreciate that

53
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,220
um we do something a little bit

54
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,500
different I'm gonna shout out to a

55
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,899
certain cncf initiative which is not

56
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,759
really part of the tag security but

57
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,320
I love it and I just have to give it

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,219
mention

59
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,360
um is everybody aware of fippy

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
wow people are really missing out

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,080
um

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,300
this is the Illustrated children's guide

63
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,860
to kubernetes

64
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,980
then have people heard about this

65
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,780
wow okay a lot more people need to know

66
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,980
about this

67
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,780
um this is me reading my daughter her

68
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,980
favorite bedtime story and it is her

69
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,060
favorite

70
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,260
um so those of you don't know about this

71
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,420
book you can check it out at 50. IO it's

72
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,819
a cncf page they also sell these

73
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,980
squishies and plushes of the characters

74
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,920
and they're a bunch of other books and

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,239
in fact if you start educating them

76
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,980
early you could we'll see if this works

77
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,800
you can get this out of it

78
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
what's your favorite container

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,738
orchestration platform

80
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
let's get on in Okay so

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,480
tag stands for technical Advisory Group

83
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,239
the cncf has a large number of technical

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,860
advisory groups well I don't know what

85
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,080
the number is but there's several and

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,700
this is obviously the one that deals

87
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,940
with security

88
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,860
we are Developer focused group we want

89
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,300
to enable developers as opposed to

90
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,360
blocking them we're volunteers from all

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,819
backgrounds all over the world and we

92
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,500
try to strengthen Security in the cloud

93
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,659
native ecosystem through education

94
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,360
Security reviews of cncf projects which

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,659
was covered in a previous talk

96
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,840
by Raga and by Andy Martin

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,980
publishing resources to help everyone

98
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,900
involve the con native landscape which

99
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,220
is what this talk is going to focus on

100
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,739
specifically and also conferences like

101
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,780
this one this is a project of tag

102
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,400
security

103
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
and the previous Cloud native security

104
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
kinds and

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,220
uh security days that were the

106
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,540
predecessor to this conference that you

107
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,519
heard about this morning at the Keynote

108
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,379
we run everything via our GitHub

109
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,620
repository cncf tag security

110

120
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,820
conversations and we have different

121
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,020
working groups for different projects

122
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,340
that we work on

123
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,900
here is a leadership team all these

124
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,600
species faces were on the keynote slide

125
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,900
this morning

126
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,540
so I won't go over too much so I'll

127
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,880
gloss over this a bit what let's get

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,979
into what we do though

129
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,960
we have a lot of different initiatives

130
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,139
and we've had in the past uh maybe had

131
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,180
trouble communicating what all the

132
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,979
things that we published are and how

133
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,139
people can make use of them so that's a

134
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,600
portion of what this this talk is is

135
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,860
intended to do

136
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,460
uh show what we have and what how how it

137
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,280
can help you and how you can contribute

138
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,259
we so we published white papers

139
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,740
guidelines best practices and then

140
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,320
tooling for things like assessments so

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,540
that we can allow projects to assess

142
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,580
what they're doing if they're following

143
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,139
their best practices and whether they're

144
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,639
doing things in the most secure way

145
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,160
we're not a government's body and we do

146
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,020
not do incident response that's out of

147
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,680
our scope a really main focus here is

148
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,660
our Flagship white paper which is the

149
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,639
cloud native security white paper can I

150
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,840
have a show of hands how many people

151
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,580
have heard of the cloud native security

152
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,800
white paper

153
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,020
okay some we still have more work to do

154
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,340
okay

155
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,139
um okay great so

156

157
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,520
it's written by a lot of authors it's

158
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,440
very much a community project

159

it's published as a PDF and in markdown

160
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,520
and we also have an audio recording for

161

170
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,900
runtime on and on and of course as with

171
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,160
anything in Cloud native things are

172
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,139
always evolving so we originally

173
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,539
published version one and then we

174
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,060
immediately started a retrospective and

175
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,340
started working on version two and now

176
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,580
we have version two published and there

177
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,199
are there's going to be a version three

178
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,720
and there's opportunities to get

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
involved in that which I'll cover a

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,919
little bit more detail soon

181
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,139
and

182
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,960
the target audience is is

183
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
project teams who

184
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,160
do Cloud native and want to make sure

185
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,419
they're doing it securely so I'm just

186
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,979
going to show a brief

187
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,400
I'm not going to go through the Hawaii

188
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
paper because it is long but this is the

189
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,660
table of contents just so you can get an

190
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,639
idea of what it what what's in scope in

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,199
the white paper there's the different

192
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,580
life cycle phases

193
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,580
um

194
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,940
and

195
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,460
goes by each by each phase

196
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,620
lots of information if you want to drill

197
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,919
down into something specific

198
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,139
a lot of content is it's really great

199
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,240
and as I said it's a PDF but it's also

200
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,080
available in markdown

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
we have

202
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,160
um

203
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,259
translations

204
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,400
some of which are completed some

205
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,840
arbitrary in progress and we're always

206
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,580
open to to new ones

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,060
we have I'm going to soon I'm going to

208
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,620
show a list of GitHub issues and as I

209
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,819
mentioned we run everything through

210
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,740
regular repository and we have GitHub

211
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,240
issues for version three already so if

212
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,860
anybody wants to get involved you just

213
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,360
post a comment there will tell you what

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,180
you can help out with also we have our

215
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,620
slack which I'll

216
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,319
show off soon which will also uh also

217
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,639
where we talk about these things and in

218
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,560
our meetings so again I'll Circle back

219
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,080
to all that afterwards in addition to

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,139
this main Flagship white paper we also

221
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,160
have a few others so we have this Supply

222
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,840
software supply chain best practices

223
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,819
white paper

224
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,919
which is obviously specifically about

225
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,860
supply chain security

226
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,560
we also have

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,379
a few other things we have a framework

228
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,760
for evaluating your supply chain

229
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,099
security so if you follow white paper

230
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,479
and then you want to see

231
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,219
somewhat of like a checklist did I did

232
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,320
we do this right you can go through the

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,899
here and uh you know question answer and

234
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,820
and see how you've done

235
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,080
another publication that we have which

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,060
is if you want to get involved with

237
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,920
something this is pretty easy to get

238
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,240
involved in pretty low barrier to entry

239
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,920
we have a catalog of supply chain

240
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,620
compromises supply chain compromises are

241
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,940
happening all the time

242
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,500
and

243
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,480
we wanted a we wanted there to be a

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,000
central location for people to

245
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,720
look through research analyze real world

246
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,580
cases that have happened real supply

247
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,740
chain incidents that have happened

248
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,500
see if they can find things in common

249
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,480
and learn learn from them so we created

250
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,279
this list that's published on our GitHub

251
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,260
repository

252
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,899
it goes back to

253
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,279
um sure what year it goes back to it

254
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,600
goes out pretty far like 2003 or

255
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,040
something the first like recorded supply

256
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,320
chain security attack and then all the

257
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
way up till till now

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
if you know of one that's not listed

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,240
please submit a PR

260
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,500
and if you're interested in supply chain

261
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,480
security which I mean maybe you're all

262
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,399
sick of it by now after two days but if

263
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,200
you're not some for by some some miracle

264
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,760
you're not sick of it yet

265
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,459
um you can you can learn a lot from from

266
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,600
this list

267
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,220
great great way to get acquainted with

268
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,540
real world impacts

269
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,279
there's a lot of other projects also a

270
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,380
lot of projects in flight and we're

271
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,140
always looking people to get involved

272
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,880
here's a list of some of the GitHub

273
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,440
issues that we're currently working on

274
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
if there's something that speaks to you

275
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,100
go to that GitHub issue post a comment

276
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,279
say that you want to contribute

277
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,279
we can help get you

278
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,420
um

279
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,000
on your way towards that

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
and I'll show the slide again at that at

281
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,420
the end or you can take a picture of it

282
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,440
now

283
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,300
another thing that I've I've talked to a

284
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,980
lot of people here at the conference and

285
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,959
something that I I've found interesting

286
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,220
is that when people think about

287
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,440
contributing to open source they often

288
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,860
think about writing code or

289
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,240
things like that where they have to have

290
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,800
or or they think they think it's

291
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,820
difficult because you need to understand

292
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,220
what's going on in a project to be able

293
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,540
to write code

294
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,600
or or to really understand the depths of

295
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,459
it something that people don't realize

296
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,560
is that you can contribute to open

297
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,200
source by doing very simple things I

298
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,240
recently had a pull request for somebody

299
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,519
who literally was fixing a grammar

300
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,040
mistake or a spelling mistake in one of

301
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,560
the white papers that's valuable that's

302
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,060
extremely valuable and that's something

303
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,180
that anybody can do and we encourage you

304
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,860
too

305
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,560
another thing we do is

306
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,000
we have as I mentioned we have our

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,160
weekly meetings you can show up show up

308
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,300
to the meetings

309
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,860
the information about that is also on

310
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,839
our data repository show up to the

311
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,000
meetings and

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,040
just be part of the conversation

313
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,459
we also have

314
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,839
somebody needs to take notes at all the

315
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,579
meetings that we have it's very helpful

316
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,839
to have notes afterwards to go through

317
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,240
if you missed a meeting or that kind of

318
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,279
thing have a record of things besides

319
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,779
for the video recording but you know to

320
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,519
have it in a shorter form

321
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,560
if you want to get involved show up to

322
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,720
the meeting and offer describe

323
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,820
meaning just take notes as we're going

324
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,279
along and that's extremely helpful

325
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,500
super useful

326
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,880
one thing I wanted to give special

327
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,380
mention on here so lightweight threat

328
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,140
modeling was this was covered by Andy

329
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,480
two sessions ago

330
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,940
and security assessments was covered by

331
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,920
Raga one session ago

332
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,440
and Kanye Square white paper we just

333
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,480
talked about this is the 3.0 the issue

334
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,220
for 3.0 this is the audio which I'll

335
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,079
talk about more in a second we also have

336
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,579
a zero trust white paper which is in

337
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,339
progress some of you may have met Assad

338
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,000
faizi who is not here right now but he

339
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,980
he's somewhere around and he's working

340
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,180
on that if you want to get in on that

341
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,079
it's almost finished

342
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,700
in terms of the white paper

343
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,120
um I I the audio uh the story with the

344
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,720
audio is that

345
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,160
I personally and a lot of people

346
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,260
don't necessarily have time to read or

347
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,120
don't prioritize their time in such a

348
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
way where they end up reading very much

349
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,480
but maybe they have commutes or they

350
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,040
wash dishes or whatever and they want an

351
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,899
audio version so

352
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,760
what we've done is this is another way

353
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,959
people can contribute without having to

354
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,480
write a line of code is

355
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,579
we split up the white paper into

356
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,920
sections and different people can read

357
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,680
different sections record it and we put

358
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,959
it on Soundcloud and anybody can

359
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,800
listen to it

360
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,519
since the white paper is always a work

361
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,160
in progress so we had version one

362
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,980
audio currently is up to version one

363
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,560
now we have the white paper version two

364
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,720
markdown and PDF generated from the

365
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,760
markdown the audio needs to be updated

366
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
to version two so that's something that

367
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,300
we're working on now updating that

368
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,680
eventually there's going to be version

369
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,600
three and we're going to need that so

370
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
definitely something that if you have a

371
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,980
voice you can get involved in

372
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
okay how do all these projects actually

373
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,500
improve Security in the cloud native

374
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,860
world

375
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,740
besides for Publications

376
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,200
we also do

377
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,420
more in-person things a big part of

378
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,800
creating Cloud native Securities

379
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,160
education and partnership so we engage

380
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,320
with projects and communities

381
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,060
in both security related and non-secure

382
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,279
related one of the goal one of the roles

383
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,500
of the tax security is when a project

384
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,839
wants to move up in the cncf landscape

385
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,880
so we have a lot of sandbox projects we

386
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
want to move up towards graduated they

387
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,660
have to go through a Security review

388
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,459
tax security takes care of that we

389
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,019
provide ways of doing self-assessments

390
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,500
security Pals support for these projects

391
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,360
in their Journey towards having a good

392
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,740
security posture

393
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,600
here are some presentations that we've

394
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,820
done this is another really cool thing

395
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,019
if you come to the meetings is another

396
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,779
another fantastic feature is that

397
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,760
projects will

398
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,040
put on presentations for us they'll come

399
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,360
and show show what they've done

400
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,579
cubescape is a recently added cncf

401
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,019
sandbox project

402
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,500
we got a great preview of this they came

403
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,300
and did a presentation we were able to

404
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,399
ask questions asked them why they did

405
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,839
certain things

406
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,600
and give them feedback they can then go

407
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,459
take that feedback

408
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,740
work it into their product and improve

409
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,180
the security

410
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,980
same thing with there's a couple of

411
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,959
other assessments you can you can I mean

412
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,600
presentations you you can take a look at

413
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,980
over here

414
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,620
we also collaborate with other groups

415
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,740
like The kubernetes Sig security which

416
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,040
should not be confused with tag security

417
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,199
um sigs are are within kubernetes

418
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
specifically tags are cncf more broadly

419
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,779
we have a lot of overlap there a lot of

420
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,260
cross-pollination of ideas

421
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,980
and openssf which is here we work with

422
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,839
them on some things it's also on supply

423
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,860
chain stuff particularly

424
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,480
and I sort of covered this we assist

425
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
projects graduating through cncf levels

426
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,160
they present at a meeting we ask them

427
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,320
questions Etc

428
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,540
gives more perspectives on a project and

429
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,160
self-assessments and Joint reviews I'm

430
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
not going to cover too much because that

431
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,500
was covered previously

432
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,300
and where can you jump in because this

433
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,240
is open source so first of all call to

434
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,579
action we have a supply chain security

435
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,959
survey

436
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
which we're conducting to understand

437
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,320
how people relate to the supply chain

438
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,079
security and supply chain and how we can

439
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,760
best help

440
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,519
and what we can do to improve things so

441
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,100
please take this survey if you haven't

442
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,920
already some of you may have already

443
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,180
this is very very helpful to us because

444
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,300
we're trying to provide value to the

445
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,560
community so it would be very helpful

446
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,079
for us to know what where the gaps are

447
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,540
what people need what people are already

448
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,579
doing what people are maybe not doing

449
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,980
yet maybe should be doing that kind of

450
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,259
thing so it'll be very helpful anybody

451
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,820
take that survey you can take a picture

452
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,980
of the QR code otherwise the slides will

453
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,980
be on sketch

454
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,199
and then just come join us it's an open

455
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,380
Community you can come GitHub tag

456
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,899
security

457
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,059
we have a tax security Channel and the

458
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,880
cncf slack workspace we're on Twitter we

459
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,740
have a mailing list Zoom you can watch

460
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,619
our our stuff on YouTube

461
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,900
and I'm going to show the oh yeah in the

462
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,119
meeting calendars available on on GitHub

463
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,119
as well I'm going to show

464
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,919
one new thing we just put out which was

465
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,720
a list of Publications I didn't go

466
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,099
through every single one of these in the

467
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,520
slides but we have a a list

468
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,059
oh there we go our repository of things

469
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,100
that we have published and there's quite

470
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,299
a lot there's something for everybody

471
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,860
probably we have the cloud native

472
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,419
security white paper as we talked about

473
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,880
we talked about this and this this is

474
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,440
another another a reference architecture

475
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
this I believe was mentioned at the

476
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,100
keynote today

477
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,200
or one of the other sessions we have

478
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,660
plenty of security lexicon which is

479
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,220
great for just getting standard

480
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,919
terminology use cases

481
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
policy stuff

482
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,240
secure defaults for cloud native this is

483
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,039
a fantastic resource

484
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,080
on creating secure defaults

485
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,419
we have security controls catalog which

486
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,419
Maps the controls that we list in the

487
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,640
cloud native security white paper to

488
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,520
nist so if you want if you have to be

489
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,280
you want to work with with nist SB 800

490
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
you can

491
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,220
um

492
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,280
you can reference the white paper that

493
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,539
we put out and

494
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,340
and see where things where things align

495
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,480
and then we have a bunch of security

496
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,799
assessments here's the ones that we've

497
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,400
done so far and uh uh there's you know

498
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,539
there'll be more obviously

499
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,140
okay here is the list of projects again

500
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,960
um people can get involved in and also

501
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
I'm here raga's here a few others are

502
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,880
here you can definitely reach out to us

503
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,580
