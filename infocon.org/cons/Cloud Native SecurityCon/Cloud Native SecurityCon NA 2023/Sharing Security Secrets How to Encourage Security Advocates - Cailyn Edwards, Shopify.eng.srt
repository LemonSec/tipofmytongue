1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
so my name is Caitlin uh thank you so

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,019
much for sticking around today I know

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,580
this is the last talk and I'm all that's

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,799
between you and probably tasty food and

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,420
beverage so I really appreciate you all

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,639
being here my talk today is sharing

7
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,679
security Secrets how to encourage

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,260
security advocates

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,640
um this is just a rough summary of what

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm going to go over we'll start with

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,720
the basics the what the who the why and

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,300
then we'll dig deeper into the how

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,960
specifically I'm going to look at

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,180
techniques that managers can do and

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,920
techniques that individual contributors

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,599
can do we'll finish with a couple

17
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,719
examples from Shopify as well as tag

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,480
security and Sig security

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
so we'll start off with the easy bit

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,980
about me my name is Kalyn as I said I've

21
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,899
been at Shopify for about five years on

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,480
a variety of teams but currently I am on

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,120
infrastructure security doing a super

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,980
awesome placement on our kubernetes

25
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,480
foundations team which I could spend

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
this whole talk talking about so if you

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,660
want to hear more about it please hit me

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,300
up later this slide illustrates what I

29
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,800
do when I am not doing computer

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,360
programming things which is hang out

31
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,760
with my fur children for skit and Luna

32
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,799
go running with my husband and in the

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,299
bottom corner you can see our dream

34
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,860
house that we're building which takes up

35
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,400
most of my fantasizing currently

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,560
so let's start off with what our

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,780
security Advocates also known as

38
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,820
security champions

39
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,799
I like to think of them as various as

40
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,900
little birds or as the neighborhood

41
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,299
watch so these are folks that are spread

42
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,220
across your company not necessarily on a

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,020
security team that are thinking about

44
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,180
security you can see the definition here

45
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,040
cyber security Advocates attempt to

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,380
reduce exposure to cyber attacks by

47
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,240
promoting security best practices and

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,579
encouraging security adoption so you can

49
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,280
imagine not only are they influencing

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,840
the projects that they're working on to

51
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,520
make secure decisions but they're also

52
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,280
able to pull in security teams when they

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,600
think that it would be reasonable which

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,479
is nice

55
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,360
so more importantly who are slash should

56
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,540
be security advocates

57
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,299
spoiler everyone anyone all of you

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,579
please be a security Advocate it's

59
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,780
awesome

60
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,219
um it's really important to note that

61
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,799
they don't have to be cyber Security

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,060
Professionals those are going to be the

63
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,979
natural choices obviously we're all here

64
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,720
we care about cyber security that's

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,260
something that we're already doing but

66
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,700
um it's even better if you can find

67
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,319
folks that are in other areas of

68
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,480
expertise that can bring unique context

69
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,000
that we don't necessarily have and then

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,940
apply security mindset to that

71
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,459
we can't do it all so hitting more on

72
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,220
that is we can't know every single thing

73
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,660
that's happening at our companies

74
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,120
particularly in a large company but also

75
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
in a small company because if you're in

76
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,480
a small company likely your trust orc is

77
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,280
not that big in fact there might just be

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,080
one person who's responsible for

79
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
securing the company so it's really

80
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,340
important to have people looking out for

81
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,560
you and wanting to pull you into things

82
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
where they think that your input would

83
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,680
be valuable and security Advocates are a

84
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
great way to do that

85
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,519
so why do we need security Advocates

86
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,080
I've touched on it a little bit but I'll

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,620
go into some more of the details

88
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,819
um we've all seen these headlines

89
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,040
hopefully not too many of us have had to

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,140
deal with responding to these headphones

91
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,599
Headlines by being at the companies

92
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,879
um but security is part of our everyday

93
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,040
experience I think

94
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,080
like most people who don't know anything

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
about computer programming know about

96
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,640
hackers they know about compromises this

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,920
is what the media sees and this is where

98
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,720
crime is happening this is where more

99
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,000
and more sensitive data financials

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,459
health information is all going online

101
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,420
and this is what we need to protect

102
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,900
so as security Engineers we are small

103
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,060
fish in a big pond that means we have

104
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,819
less influence and sway in a larger

105
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,400
organization it's I don't know a company

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,500
that has a larger security team than

107
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,319
General Workforce because due to

108
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,580
necessity you need to have more

109
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,680
Engineers to build the product but it

110
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,260
means it's really tough for us to secure

111
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,180
everything like I said we can't be

112
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,420
everywhere at once so how as little fish

113
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,000
do we make sure that that whole Pond is

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,400
secure we chat up those big fish and we

115
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
make sure that they come and they see us

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,159
and they tell us and they talk to us and

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,420
we make sure that people care about

118
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,580
security and want to ship secure

119
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,239
products

120
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,478
at one example that highlights this

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
really well is uh Conway's law I'm not

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,680
sure if you're familiar with it but it

123
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,500
states that an organization's structure

124
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,360
will be reflected in the software they

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,699
build so if you have one big flat

126
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,139
structure it's likely that your

127
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,820
company's software will be kind of

128
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,759
Monolithic and one Big Blob and if you

129
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,759
have a really separated culture then

130
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,720
you're going to end up with something

131
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,880
that's more serviced and split

132
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,580
and so how can we look at that from a

133
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,680
security perspective if you have your

134
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,479
entire org in this tiny little bit

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,820
thinking about security it's very likely

136
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,160
that your software is going to have a

137
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,040
tiny little bit of security coverage

138
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,400
but if we add security into the

139
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,560
organization at different levels each

140
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,560
piece of software is likely to have a

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,419
security concept or be thinking about

142
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,960
security which I think is exactly why a

143
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,820
security Advocate Program is an awesome

144
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,680
idea

145
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,199
in the cloud native security white paper

146
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,180
there was this quote which highlights

147
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,699
exactly what I'm trying to get at in

148
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,199
this talk which is by integrating

149
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,419
security as early as possible throughout

150
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,340
the development life cycle or even

151
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,919
earlier with interactive developer

152
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,840
training security organizations can

153
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,880
enable preventive security rather than

154
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,500
reactive security and so it doesn't have

155
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,840
to just be security organizations it can

156
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,419
be within an organization all the time

157
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,259
our developer teams hit us at the point

158
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,000
of release and they say hey can you just

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,259
give us the check mark so that we can

160
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,479
release this project project or so we

161
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
can move tears and all of a sudden we

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,680
have to say so sorry but you need to fix

163
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,479
this and this and this and this and now

164
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,759
we're impacting that team's goals and

165
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,199
all that they're seeing the security

166
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,900
team as is a burden and a block to them

167
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,000
meeting their cycles and addressing the

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,259
pressure they have from above

169
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,979
um so now that we've talked a little bit

170
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,160
about what security Advocates are and

171
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,300
what the goal is we're going to talk

172
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,220
about how we can Implement them and I

173
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,960
just want to note that there are a whole

174
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,820
bunch of really fantastic formal

175
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,580
education programs for creating security

176
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,139
Advocates or Champions and those

177
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,600
programs are focused around educating

178
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,300
and having a formal role this this talk

179
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,060
aims for the stage before that so

180
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,979
educating and garnering interests so

181
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,900
that people want to participate in

182
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,360
programs like that and just having a

183
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,300
general security culture at your company

184
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,819
so what can managers do disclaimer I am

185
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,680
not a manager nor have I ever been a

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,900
manager but I've harvested some really

187
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,639
good tips from The Amazing managers that

188
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,460
I work with primarily Ann Wallace

189
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,280
first off is Be A Champion yourself we

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
need Champions at the top level of

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,780
companies because if the company is

192
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,300
trying to sell security as a goal and

193
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,800
there aren't security advocates in

194
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,419
senior leadership you're going to have

195
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,000
to justify that business cause and it's

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
really hard to explain how security

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,740
makes a company money

198
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,380
um I mean we don't we save companies

199
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,360
money and when security is going really

200
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,100
well you don't know what's happening

201
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,360
because you're not ending up in the

202
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,520
headlines It's Just Happening seamlessly

203
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,039
so if you have folks in senior

204
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,319
leadership positions a they have the

205
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,660
knowledge to sell security as a business

206
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,199
expense and be or as a business argument

207
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,599
and B it gets built into the

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,460
company-wide goals we're all in a really

209
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,039
tough time right now for software it's

210
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,380
not you know just throw money at

211
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,000
everything anymore and so it's really

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
important that teams are working toward

213
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
business goals and we need educated

214
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,940
folks to argue for security so that that

215
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,800
can happen

216
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,780
and this just goes a little bit deeper

217
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,560
into that so ensuring that not only just

218
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
at executive leadership but in

219
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,979
management as well that your okrs and

220
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,660
your team goals and your cycle goals

221
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,900
have security as part of them it sucks

222
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,120
to be a security team and not feel like

223
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,400
anyone is valuing the work that you're

224
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
doing instead you're looking at how can

225
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,080
we increase users increase income

226
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,020
um and I don't have the skills to tell

227
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,819
people why we really really need to

228
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,280
invest in security so having senior

229
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,900
leadership and management do that is

230
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,300
very very important

231
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,900
next is uh the more fun part which is

232
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,759
support and sponsor events like

233
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,279
hackathons or

234
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,219
um learn to hack any kind of interactive

235
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,679
events that you can you can sponsor or

236
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,140
host will help spread security awareness

237
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,479
in a really fun and approachable way a

238
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,240
few ways that we do this at Shopify are

239
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,940
a learn to hack Workshop so this exists

240
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,040
in our in our repository and anyone can

241
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,720
do it at any time it's super super fun

242
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,640
we've got like a really vulnerable web

243
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,680
page and we walk you through finding

244
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,260
different exploits and during any kind

245
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,980
of security awareness periods of time we

246
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,080
will run in person workshops where we'll

247
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,459
actually have a whole bunch of security

248
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,200
nerds help you do this and be really

249
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,700
excited that you're taking the time to

250
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,860
learn and then a big thing every October

251
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,800
we do cyber security awareness month I'm

252
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,720
an infrastructure security engineer I do

253
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,399
kubernetes that's what I like to talk

254
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,959
about but at this point in time our

255
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,480
whole trust org comes together to share

256
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,459
all sorts of security information and we

257
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,680
go well beyond you know don't click on

258
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,720
this phishing email we go into how their

259
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,880
services are protected and how they can

260
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,440
involve Security in their day-to-day

261
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,300
workflows

262
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,820
so what can ICS do this is much more my

263
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,740
area of expertise and this is something

264
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,540
that I've been doing a lot of since I

265
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,019
started on a security team at Shopify

266
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,880
um first off be a security Advocate

267
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,160
yourself do what I'm doing stand up tell

268
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,839
people about security why it's awesome

269
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,240
why we should educate people just do it

270
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,779
just talk about it get out there

271
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,899
next is consult don't dictate so this I

272
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,459
mentioned it a little bit earlier but

273
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,620
I've been a part of a few projects that

274
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,140
have involved going out to various teams

275
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,880
and having them actually much like the

276
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,019
talk that just happened before this

277
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,640
having them run do a patch or having

278
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,580
them deploy some kind of security

279
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,500
measures that we have decided are

280
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,200
mandatory and often by the time I get in

281
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,240
the room with them it's not that they

282
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
don't want to secure their product it's

283
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,899
not that they disagree with me but I'm

284
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,399
actively

285
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,500
making it harder for them to achieve

286
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,660
their goals they have to pull people off

287
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,580
of other work to do the security work

288
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,860
and they don't want to because no one on

289
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,120
the team has invested their leadership

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,040
isn't invested and I'm just this person

291
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
telling them they have to do a thing

292
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,140
um so we all know when we pair program

293
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,120
you totally change the way that you're

294
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,500
approaching a problem all of a sudden

295
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,820
you're writing the best code you ever

296
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,440
have and you can't type it all of course

297
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
because it's terribly stressful but you

298
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,600
when you work together you're going to

299
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
both bring your context to make

300
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,620
something better and you're also going

301
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,980
to do good work so I think trying to

302
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,899
create a security Advocate Program means

303
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,600
that in the design phase you're helping

304
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,680
people

305
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,899
learn about what decisions they can make

306
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,000
to make the product more secure and then

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,040
when it comes to that oh we have to do

308
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,540
the security review it's just a check

309
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,720
mark because they followed the steps

310
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,420
educate so again I'm doing that right

311
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,760
now and uh everyone I've done it at

312
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,820
Shopify in a variety of ways

313
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,279
um I love this comic I wish I wish I

314
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,260
could read it out it's very funny

315
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,959
um but basically you know I I remember

316
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
when I joined security everyone was like

317
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,640
oh yeah and like Alice and Bob and Eve

318
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,040
who are these people and why are they so

319
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,720
popular in security but no one explained

320
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
it to me because everyone took it for

321
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,660
granted that you know who Alice and Bob

322
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,220
are you're not in a security room and

323
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,079
you don't know who Alice and Bob are

324
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
people don't know and people don't know

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
a whole bunch of the things that we

326
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,720
think are really basic so I think that

327
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,420
it's important to educate and educate

328
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,399
really openly and welcome lace start

329
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,459
with the basics don't ever hesitate to

330
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,260
to motivate people to ask questions

331
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,480
explain everything as much as you can so

332
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,339
that people aren't feeling intimidated

333
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,000
by security

334
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,420
um so when I've crafted a few uh

335
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,820
educational programs at Shopify and I'll

336
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,860
talk about some of the focus points I

337
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,740
have when I'm creating content

338
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,240
so the first one is to talk about

339
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,820
security incidents both internal and

340
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,480
external we have done at Shopify a few

341
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,660
sessions called um anatomy of a hack and

342
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,000
we take this opportunity so a recent one

343
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
was after the Uber hack we didn't we saw

344
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,500
a whole bunch of people in our slack

345
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,959
channels being like oh man this is crazy

346
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,700
this happened at Uber look at this

347
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,260
Hacker News article oh my goodness

348
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,500
security it's awesome are we doing

349
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,480
security at all and then our security

350
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,060
team was like yes in fact we do a lot of

351
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,680
security and we'd love to tell you about

352
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,180
it and so we hosted these sessions

353
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,980
myself and a few of my colleagues were

354
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,200
on a panel and we started by explaining

355
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,300
the incident again demystifying it going

356
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,639
to all the details of what happened why

357
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,940
it happened how Uber responded and then

358
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,579
we did our best to explain how a similar

359
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,440
attack might happen at Shopify what

360
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,180
preventative measures we have what would

361
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,519
we do at various stages of the attack

362
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,019
and people were really really really

363
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,720
interested in it we finished with it ama

364
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,579
where folks were able to ask a whole

365
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,500
bunch of questions about the way that we

366
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,019
do security at Shopify and it just got

367
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,139
people engaged in talking about it

368
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,899
the next one is how to threat model uh

369
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,000
recently our team has grown and we've

370
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,500
ended up with a whole bunch of more

371
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,019
traditional background security folks

372
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:37,920
that

373
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,720
introduced a lot of threat modeling I

374
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,040
had never done a threat model before and

375
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,860
now I've done countless and I think that

376
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,500
this is this is now something I do in

377
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,079
every security education program I run

378
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,500
at Shopify because it allows people

379
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,880
immediately to apply the security

380
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,160
principles to their own work not only

381
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,019
that but it's a

382
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,980
it's a way of thinking that is already

383
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,000
ingrained in developers like look at

384
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,860
your system find points of failure

385
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,300
that's something we all do every day

386
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,920
when we're writing in code and dealing

387
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,019
with software and the threat model is

388
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,700
just an awesome way to get people doing

389
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,740
things right away

390
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,260
next is I'm like really hammering this

391
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,420
nail in as someone who joined software

392
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,639
previously being a farmer cover the

393
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,339
basics don't assume any knowledge

394
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,440
definitely if you're doing your third or

395
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,139
fourth educational talk you don't want

396
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,940
to start it off with like okay this is

397
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,100
what security means so create recorded

398
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,399
accessible content that folks can go and

399
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,079
look at before attending your sessions

400
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,899
send it in the email put it in the event

401
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,880
have it as part of your onboarding so

402
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,260
people can go and know the security

403
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,880
basics

404
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
and not feel intimidated when they're

405
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,540
attending anatomy of a hack and getting

406
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,420
into some of the deeper Concepts

407
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,760
explain the Security Org so again I said

408
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,199
I have worked in a whole bunch of

409
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,300
different places at Shopify and I used

410
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,820
to just work on our core product doing

411
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,519
um back-end rails and I didn't know that

412
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,320
security existed I didn't know that we

413
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
had a Security Org I certainly didn't

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,399
know what they did and I find that a lot

415
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,899
when I talk to people like oh wow

416
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,880
security what do you do over there how

417
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,199
many people are you do you guys even

418
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,660
write code so I think explaining the

419
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,760
Security Org is just a great way to have

420
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,100
people know just I mean not always

421
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,959
Shopify is really lucky but how much

422
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,279
access they have to Security Experts

423
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,920
and the last one is to go over security

424
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,300
tools so at Shopify we have this awesome

425
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,360
internal just-in-time access control

426
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,860
that allows people to get permits to

427
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,660
access resources it's really great it

428
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,339
works in a variety of ways and it's one

429
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,779
of the tools that we own that pretty

430
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,699
much anyone at Shopify can make use of

431
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,519
and so every time I talk about security

432
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,079
I tell people about this tool it's

433
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,420
called cloudu it's awesome this is how

434
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,459
you could use it at your company or at

435
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,740
on your team to control access to

436
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,820
something that might be a sensitive

437
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,560
resource and I think we all have that

438
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,540
it's a great opportunity to say Hey you

439
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,860
know that little thing that pops up on

440
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,540
GitHub that's actually a tool we created

441
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,099
that's checking for x y and z

442
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,139
okay now the examples part

443
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,260
um so recently I again disclaimer I

444
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,540
wasn't directly involved in this project

445
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,459
um some really amazing people on my team

446
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,860
were but when I proposed this talk um I

447
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
immediately thought of this project

448
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,100
the goal we did uh our annual planning

449
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,160
and decided that we just wanted to be

450
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,740
involved in every project we wanted

451
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,899
infrastructure security to be everywhere

452
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,540
we can't do that there's not that many

453
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,800
of us and there are a lot of different

454
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
projects and services being created all

455
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,420
the time at Shopify so the way that we

456
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,399
decided to handle it was to try and move

457
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,060
up our involvement in the development or

458
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,579
project process so it at Shopify we call

459
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,560
it get done but it's just our

460
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,660
regular project workflow it starts with

461
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,259
a proposal moves to a prototype we trash

462
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,720
the Prototype hopefully and then build

463
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,699
the product and release the product and

464
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,099
previously we were called in only at the

465
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,919
release stage to do a Security review or

466
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,199
again if they wanted to move tiers we

467
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,400
would get called in to do a Security

468
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,000
review now with this new project we're

469
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,980
involved as early as the Prototype

470
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,419
because it's automated and built into

471
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,220
GitHub so it's possible that they're

472
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,500
already getting feedback on decisions

473
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
that they're making in their earliest

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,819
probably sloppiest code which hopefully

475
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,500
influences the decisions they made in

476
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,240
the build but at the very least we're

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,520
being pulled in to the build before

478
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,780
they've

479
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,520
before they've had to request the

480
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,460
security review so to me that's like

481
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,980
really really huge and awesome

482
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,620
some of the goals of this project were a

483
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,320
shorter lead time for Security reviews

484
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,820
we were pretty good about getting to

485
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,220
Security reviews we have a team meeting

486
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,100
every week we would triage any new

487
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,020
reviews and usually someone would tackle

488
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,320
them within the week but after they

489
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,299
would do the review it would result in

490
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,860
some actionable items and then we would

491
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,360
have to re-review so I think the average

492
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,640
was about two weeks which if you're a

493
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,000
service owner trying to release sucks so

494
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,500
we wanted to reduce that as much as

495
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,200
possible and then tied into that is we

496
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,419
wanted fewer tier move blocking change

497
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,100
requests so we wanted to try and have

498
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,200
all of those big blockers sorted out

499
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,780
right away as soon as they make a

500
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,700
decision in their code that would be a

501
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,559
blocker something should alert them that

502
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,600
they've made a dangerous decision

503
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,020
uh 70 faster team onboarding to review

504
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,640
process

505
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,179
um I think we say three to six months at

506
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,740
the moment it would take someone to feel

507
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,320
comfortable running a Security review on

508
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,460
their own

509
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,520
um so we're hoping that really the tools

510
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,380
doing almost everything and that people

511
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,240
could join and do it within a month or

512
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,440
two and lastly is infinite infinitely

513
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,740
better relationships with service owners

514
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,520
so much of the rejection of security

515
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,200
comes from developer toil and not

516
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,299
adequately considering

517
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:03,840
um

518
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,940
a developer workflow I think Shane

519
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,880
touched on this in his keynote but when

520
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,919
we put in blockers for folks in

521
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,480
something that they do every day not

522
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,220
only are every time they hit that

523
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,140
blocker are they going to think uh Hey

524
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,419
security they suck but they're also

525
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,740
going to think

526
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,600
how can I get around this blocker is

527
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,679
there something I can do they're going

528
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,240
to try and look for ways to get off that

529
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,760
paved Road and that is not the kind of

530
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,200
behavior and thoughts we want around

531
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,460
security

532
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,919
some wins already so this project is

533
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,380
still in process and I haven't really

534
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,940
explained what they did at all which I

535
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,820
should do basically it used to be a

536
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,440
really well documented list and you

537
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,700
would go through the checklist and you

538
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,080
would do a bunch of things and make sure

539
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,480
that all of our security baselines were

540
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,900
being met now all of those checks are

541
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,940
automated and it produces a report and

542
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,400
that report is sent directly to the

543
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,679
service owners

544
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,720
and any vulnerability that is possible

545
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,059
to surface in that report report is

546
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,059
extensively documented in our docs so

547
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,500
that they can go and start to fix those

548
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,960
issues right away so the first one is

549
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,120
that now security concerns are surfaced

550
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,460
in the GitHub UI

551
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,620
it's promoting service every time they

552
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,600
make promoting awareness every time they

553
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,640
make a change to their code they're

554
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,320
seeing that directly in the CI which is

555
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,580
awesome

556
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,380
and it's stopping vulnerabilities for

557
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,940
making it into production which is extra

558
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,160
awesome and then the next one is what I

559
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
just mentioned there's a report

560
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,059
generated for service owners so the

561
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,679
review results in that list of

562
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,539
vulnerabilities and they can address

563
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,520
them right away and still wait instead

564
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,900
of waiting for us to come to them and

565
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,720
tell them how to address them and the

566
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,400
last one is that issues are open from

567
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,580
scan results so this just fits a little

568
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,260
bit better into a standard developer

569
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,620
workflow in my opinion and means that

570
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,179
instead of a comment on the review

571
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,340
they're seeing the issues in the same

572
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,840
way that they're triaging all of the

573
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,678
work for their project

574
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,960
um and so the next one is security

575
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,860
self-assessments which have also been

576
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,740
talked about a few times uh today and I

577
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,480
think are also a really great way to

578
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,299
build security advocacy

579
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,820
um both tag security and recently

580
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,280
kubernetes six security have the

581
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,620
self-assessment program and this line is

582
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,299
taken from TAG security the

583
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,039
self-assessment is the initial document

584
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,960
for projects to begin thinking about the

585
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,880
security of a project determining gaps

586
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,740
in their security and preparing any

587
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,620
security documentation for their users

588
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,380
it's a little bit less formed so far in

589
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,080
six security but basically we're doing

590
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,360
it on a volunteer basis any sub-project

591
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,480
of kubernetes that wants to do a

592
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,039
self-assessment can come to us hopefully

593
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,419
they have their data model but if they

594
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,640
don't we'll work with them to create or

595
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,500
sorry their data flow diagram and from

596
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,120
that we'll create a threat model and

597
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,679
we'll talk them through the various

598
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,020
vulnerabilities that exist and then work

599
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,880
with them to create actionable issues

600
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,980
that again will exist on the repo and

601
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,539
hopefully get folks to go and pick up

602
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,799
those issues and work on those

603
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,200
vulnerabilities and similar to tag

604
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,179
security it results in a really nice

605
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,299
documented security summary for those

606
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,020
projects and Sig security is planning on

607
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,620
running a workshop to do threat models

608
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,520
at kubecon and eventually

609
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,320
potentially as part of the contributor

610
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,760
Summit but if there's interest maybe

611
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,640
also as part of the mainstream at coupon

612
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,720
we'd like to do uh like walking sub

613
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,580
projects through this process in a way

614
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,900
that people could observe and

615
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,440
participate

616
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,299
so the summary my takeaways for this

617
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,539
talk

618
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,799
how to encourage and build a security

619
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,260
Advocate culture so first off attend

620
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,600
this talk start looking at how other

621
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,480
companies do it just think about what's

622
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,000
out there start advocating yourself tell

623
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
people about the cool things you're

624
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,039
doing

625
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,380
really if you are a manager start

626
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,299
advocating for security and get other

627
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,520
managers to understand why security is

628
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,980
important if you're not a manager

629
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,080
then finds the managers get them to

630
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,340
support you

631
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,280
um let them know how important this is

632
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,100
don't gatekeep so that again is me

633
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,860
really dwelling on like don't assume

634
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,659
anyone has any knowledge don't make

635
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,900
security Mystic and secretive pull

636
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,179
everyone in it's awesome and they should

637
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,539
want to help us make security education

638
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,460
relevant for your audience create

639
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,320
opportunities for Hands-On learning

640
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,120
that's talking about those like learn to

641
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,400
hack workshops capture the flags any of

642
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,240
that

643
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,520
stop collaborate and listen talk to

644
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,260
teams as soon as you're going to work on

645
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,120
a security product find out who it

646
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,100
involves we have customers as security

647
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,840
teams that's everyone that we work with

648
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,760
and all developers and they shouldn't be

649
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,200
finding out about the tools we're

650
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
creating to secure them after we've

651
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,980
already developed them it's the exact

652
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,900
same problem in Reverse we need to know

653
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,179
exactly how the tooling we're creating

654
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,740
is going to impact the people that are

655
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,440
going to use it or have it built into

656
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,600
their workflow and then get security

657
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,059
goals at the top level okrs company

658
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,940
Mission guiding themes I want to see the

659
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,559
word security when I'm looking at what

660
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,720
my CEO is telling the entire company we

661
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,919
need to focus on which we actually did

662
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,539
this year and I'm very pumped for those

663
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,679
the first time since I've been around

664
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,500
that it's been said like we need to be

665
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,419
secure

666
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,280

674
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,980

677
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,740
what I should keep doing

678
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,679
and finally q and e

679
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,960
um the E for experiences if you have

680
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,039
something that you do at your company

681
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,900
that has been really effective I want to

682
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,940
know about it you can tell me now or you

683
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,380
can come tell me after or you can

684
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,780
contact me in any of the ways

685
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,860
I listed below

686
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,620
[Applause]

687
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,939
does anyone have any questions

688
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,659
yeah go ahead

689
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,460
yeah so uh the question was how do we

690
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,320
get involved in the Prototype and design

691
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,080
phase in a distributed company uh

692
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,640
because that can be really hard there's

693
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,220
one advantage is that Shopify has a

694
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,200
central area where we

695
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,000
um where we do our project proposals so

696
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,620
those are accessible to anyone and we

697
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,539
can see those so we can we can use the

698
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,820
API from that to get notifications but

699
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,880
more importantly having come from

700
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,620
um from being on a whole bunch of teams

701
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,179
I was able to build up a really big

702
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,960
network of folks at Shopify and my

703
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,000
special interest is network security so

704
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,520
I am often reaching out to the folks

705
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,080
that I know from my time working on

706
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,000
networking teams saying hey what are you

707
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,980
doing are you doing this can I see a

708
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,020
road map per chance I would love to see

709
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,980
what you're working on and that behavior

710
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,500
doesn't just benefit me like it recently

711
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,539
has resulted in a in a cross-team

712
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,580
project that's really valuable to both

713
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,140
teams and now I don't need to reach out

714
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,460
to that person they're reaching out to

715
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,980
me so creating that culture again of of

716
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,020
sharing and talking about it it

717
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,360
make it friends

718
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,080
anyone else

719
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,000
are not

720
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,620
obviously

721
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,120
so when you're

722
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,279
how do you justify education

723
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,380
that have much more immediate metrics

724
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,059
yeah that's a fair question so the

725
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,299
question was how do you justify security

726
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:14,159
education basically as a as a business

727
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,900
goal when there's so many more important

728
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,559
goals within security alone as well as

729
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,779
the rest of the company's schools

730
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,120
I don't I haven't done too much of this

731
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,279
like Shopify I've been really lucky

732
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,500
they've been really receptive there are

733
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,059
a whole bunch particularly because we're

734
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,200
distributed there are a whole bunch of

735
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
opportunities to educate

736
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,460
um and and I I like doing that so I've

737
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,100
taken that opportunity but one thing

738
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,380
that I have not tried yet but I was

739
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,419
thinking would be really valuable to get

740
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,640
the momentum is create a special

741
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
interest group and have again have those

742
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,419
people that are not on security so

743
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,340
you're not pulling security folks away

744
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,279
from security projects full-time but you

745
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,480
have these sessions these special

746
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,980
interest groups maybe it's just an hour

747
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,840
where you meet and you chat about what

748
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,039
projects are you working on do you have

749
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,659
security concerns I would assume so

750
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:01,919
because you showed up to a security

751
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,860
special interest group like how can we

752
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,200
give you the tools to

753
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,700
um to move forward with that project and

754
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,220
then hopefully you're able to approach

755
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,320
education not from the perspective of

756
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,820
I'm a security nerd I love security I

757
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,320
want everyone else to be a security nerd

758
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,760
and love security but you're approaching

759
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,799
it from I've talked to so and so and so

760
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,240
and so and they're working on these

761
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,640
projects and they don't know how to

762
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,559
address the security concerns and in the

763
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,299
past We've Ended up at release date

764
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,220
delaying their project by two weeks

765
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,900
because of a Security review having to

766
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,940
make fundamental changes that would have

767
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,220
been like would have not meaningfully

768
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,020
added to the project time had they been

769
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,360
earlier and again that's like I think we

770
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,159
all who work in security know about the

771
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,500
Hard Sell of like it's not going to be a

772
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,840
direct easy correlation but hopefully if

773
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,220
your team is already if your company is

774
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,720
already investing in security they'll

775
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
follow that that thought process

776
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,559
but I so far have not had to convince a

777
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,020
pointy-haired boss to let me educate

778
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,679
people about security

779
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,520
to figure out like

780
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,580
yeah so the question was do we have any

781
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,679
metrics for the impact of these kinds of

782
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,500
programs so that after doing them we can

783
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,840
argue for continuing to do them

784
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,539
summarizing questions that's very hard

785
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:35,520
uh no is the first thing I don't think

786
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,260
we have any clear metrics what I can

787
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,320
think of offhand is one one of the

788
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,320
educational formats we have at Shopify

789
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,419
are called coffee and tea sessions so

790
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,120
they are anyone can volunteer to do them

791
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,700
and you basically have an hour to talk

792
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,200
about something that you're very

793
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,240
interested in and usually they're like

794
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,860
involve a technical demo or something

795
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,020
and with that you can see like how many

796
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,279
people signed up how many people

797
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,679
actually attended and then we also have

798
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,000
feedback for those sessions so that

799
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,640
could be one way is like if if 70 people

800
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,200
at the company want to take an hour of

801
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,460
their day to listen to someone talk

802
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,200
about security to me that's indic

803
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,059
indicating that there's like there's a

804
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,000
need for that and second I think that

805
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,919
I'm not on the security review project

806
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,899
but I do think that they're actively

807
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,880
measuring the difference in time from

808
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
when a Security review is started to

809
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
when the project is able to be released

810
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,720
and that's going to result in

811
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,399
in metrics

812
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,380
that one's a little bit a little bit

813
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,000
less education focused because obviously

814
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,440
it's it's automated tooling like the

815
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,480
education is part of them just doing the

816
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,700
security work but to me it's the same

817
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,380
thing it's like we could take even more

818
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,880
time off of that if they don't have to

819
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,380
read a list of security concerns and

820
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,840
they just know how to uh how to secure

821
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,320
their services

822
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,580
all right well thank you so much and I'm

823
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,799
