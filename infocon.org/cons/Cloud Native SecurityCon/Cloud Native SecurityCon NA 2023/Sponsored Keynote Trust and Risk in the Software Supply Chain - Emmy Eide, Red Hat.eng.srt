1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
hello all right so I have five minutes

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,640
to take you on an adventure and uh

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,880
ending with an action that

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,920
um for the industry to step up its game

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,879
in supply chain security

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,680
all right so I'll be surprised given how

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,240
much this topic is prevalent right now

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,699
if you haven't seen this data but for

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,220
those who haven't according to the

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,859
sonotype report there's been a 742

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,840
percent increase in the average annual

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,539
supply chain attacks why because it's

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,880
lucrative not only can you attack your

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,320
target but you can attack your Target's

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,340
customers

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,520
in that same report uh they showed us

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,260
that six out of every seven project

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,760
vulnerabilities come from transitive

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,559
dependencies

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,899
so that's a gold mine

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,760
attackers gotten Weiss this thing that

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,800
has been stumping Security Experts for

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,420
the last decade and then just when we

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,160
think we've got our handle on it

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,860
some amazing new technology comes out

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,420
and it makes our software Supply chains

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,160
even more complex

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,899
so what is trust in the supply chain

29
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,059
mean I'm not talking about zero trust

30
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,739
that's different I'm talking about

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,020
having a trusted supply chain

32
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,700
we've all seen the worldwide disruption

33
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,320
when physical Supply chains are

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,740
disrupted the impact is catastrophic

35
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,939
manufacturing essential services and

36
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,680
international economies have all been

37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,900
hit extremely hard in recent years

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,340
our software supply chain is no

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,259
different and the ability to impact when

40
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,400
disrupted

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,840
when the supply chain is trusted

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,299
everyone's job is easier sales marketing

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,280
legal engineering we can provide

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,220
customers with attestations to how we

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,500
our products are made we can develop on

46
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,299
stable Enterprise platforms and most

47
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,340
obviously we can avoid massive security

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,979
disruptions that stop production

49
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,200
all of these things frankly lead to more

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,579
room for Innovation and development

51
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,159
externally many of our customers rely on

52
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,540
our products to be a part of their

53
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,799
supply chain

54
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,600
which means that if this is a positive

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,460
spiral we can ultimately lead to

56
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,840
advancements that make this world a

57
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,880
better place all because of a trusted

58
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
supply chain so we have a problem and

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,840
there's about 10 other presentations in

60
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
this conference that can dive into that

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
deeper than I can in five minutes so I'm

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
going to jump to the next steps of what

63
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
can we do about it

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,199
obvious answer is to implement security

65
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,879
controls throughout your supply chain

66
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,739
there's a variety of controls that you

67
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,120
can Implement depending on what your

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,220
supply chain looks like this is the

69
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,020
prettiest supply chain that I have ever

70
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,580
seen most of them don't look like this

71
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,860
you have various scanners Sig store

72
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,680
cosine kubliner techton chains all of

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
these wonderful ideas keyword ideas the

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,599
supply chain level for software

75
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,280
artifacts are salsa walks you through

76
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,959
the various maturity stages in best

77
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,000
practices and if you haven't seen it I

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,560
recommend going and educating yourself

79
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,099
on it

80
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,300
and of course you have user and identity

81
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,980
access management which is still one of

82
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,120
the more difficult things to implement

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
even though we the security Community

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,599
have been talking about it for many

85
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,700
years and unfortunately discussion about

86
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,560
what is right and what is wrong is not

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
what leads to security improvements

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
actually implementing those security

89
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,599
gates and checks is what we need to do

90
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,940
but how how do we get this exhaustive

91
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,120
list of ideas to reality

92
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
when you want to enable a Workforce to

93
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,319
innovate and to breakthrough barriers

94
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,360
there's got to be some beautiful

95
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,400
orchestration which brings me to my

96
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,599
biggest Point partnership

97
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,739
in order to fully Implement supply chain

98
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,120
security you have to do it in

99
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,319
Partnership and let me walk you through

100
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,300
how we learned how to do this and how it

101
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,700
transforms security at Red Hat we tried

102
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,840
to implement all of those controls

103
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,099
throughout our supply chain but those

104
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,440
were ideas in isolation were not enough

105
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,080
we had to get the people the team that

106
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,400
was creating those standards and

107
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,620
guidelines in implementation timelines

108
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,780
to understand how those security

109
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,599
Implement implementations impact product

110
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,340
planning timelines

111
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,739
integration requirements maintenance and

112
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,780
upkeep we couldn't just broadly apply

113
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,640
security requirements as a security team

114
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
and then expect the product teams to

115
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,120
just pick those up

116
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
some Enterprises go through a model of a

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,780
single supply chain which in my mind

118
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,120
would be really really nice but having

119
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,519
that and the limited code coding

120
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,739
languages to pick from kind of inhibits

121
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,400
innovation

122
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,900
so what do we do what we want to do a

123
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,519
red hat was not be so restrictive that

124
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,019
our teams couldn't innovate and come up

125
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,000
with these Technologies and we wanted so

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,099
we wanted to make security a part of the

127
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,360
development process and I'm not talking

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,160
about sec devops I am talking about

129
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
something different where security

130
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,399
controls and supply chain decisions are

131
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,720
made hand in hand with feature

132
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,580
development

133
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,020
how do you do that you keep your

134
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,080
messaging around risk always tie it back

135
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,820
so that never turns into a check the box

136
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,620
exercise we've had more government

137
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,780
regulation around supply chain Security

138
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,280
in the last couple of years than we ever

139
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,740
have before so this makes it really easy

140
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,560
to go back into that check the box

141
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,360
state

142
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,460
you have to be able to articulate the

143
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,560
why as a security team

144
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,300
and then you have to collaborate on the

145
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,460
What the how and the when

146
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,139
when you work with development teams to

147
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,580
articulate this risk and to understand

148
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,139
it and to have it be part of your core

149
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,240
culture then you can really apply

150
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,520
security controls that I've discussed on

151
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,840
previous slides

152
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,580
we've only seen success in supply chain

153
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,080
at Red Hat when we were able to use this

154
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,940
partnership approach without partnership

155
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,040
they're just ideas and ideas in

156
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,660
isolation are nothing security

157
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,300
partnership transforms those ideas into

158
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,680
results

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,180
so people are going to go around ideas

160
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,380
and they're going to take the path of

161
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,639
least resistance because that's what

162
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,259
people do

163
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,699
it's not going to systemically reduce

164
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,440
your risk because the approach that

165
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,419
approach will have holes so my proposal

166
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,220
for starting to tackle this massive

167
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,960
security problem and Supply chains is to

168
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,160
do so in partnership with your

169
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,419
engineering teams and open source

170
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,199
community

171
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,060
