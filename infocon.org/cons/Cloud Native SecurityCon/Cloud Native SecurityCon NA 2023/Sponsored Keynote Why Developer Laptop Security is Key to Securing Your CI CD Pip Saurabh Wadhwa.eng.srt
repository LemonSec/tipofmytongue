1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
uh hello everyone my name is uh swarov

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,819
vadhwa I'm a Senior Solutions engineer

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,059
at Optics and the agenda for my talk

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,259
today is Dev SEC Ops for your developer

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,079
ecosystem right uh I've been a developer

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,060
in my past life and security never

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,640
crossed my mind right but it's the harsh

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,500
reality you have developers you have

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,600
security and you have operations working

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,140
together to give you a secure working

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,359
app running in the cloud

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,399
and the second piece would be security

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,920
at the developer laptop right we never

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,860
focus on developer laptop security right

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,079
that's where the crown jewels lie you

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,640
have your code being built you have your

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,739
access Keys lying there they have admin

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,300
access to different systems for building

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,640
the app but we never focus on security

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,000
right on the right hand side you see

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
um you know something that caught my

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,680
mind uh the last pass attack right but

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,960
this is not just the only one the most

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,239
recent one being a Dropbox right and

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,880
the trend is that a lot of developer

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,400
environments are being targeted right

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,460
and it's not like these are just random

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,320
attacks the attackers are becoming

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,840
really sophisticated when they are

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,880
attacking the cicd ecosystem

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,140
so in this

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,900
on this slide you know just I'll pause

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,540
for a moment right to just take a moment

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,479
to digest what exactly is going on

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,520
you know you have your pre-production

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,740
phase where the development is happening

37
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,020
you know the developers are

38
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,060
uh developing code

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,340
committing it to a repository and then

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,659
you have the building and testing phase

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,460
and then you have the post-production

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,579
phase which is the control plane and the

43
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,600
data plane

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,299
now if we focus on the control plane and

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,100
the data plane right this is where the

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,720
different services are running you have

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,759
your orchestration or you know services

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,520
like kubernetes openshift and then you

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,619
have your runtime such as Docker right

50
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,960
and then you have the data plane where

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,520
you have the worker nodes running the

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
actual container workloads

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,220
from a security perspective this is

54
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,099
pretty siled right you don't can't

55
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,140
connect the data between what's going on

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,599
at the control plane with what's

57
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,879
actually happening inside the containers

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,220
so take for example

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,540
um

60
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,099
the

61
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,900
container Escape attack right so

62
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,340
continuous when they're deployed in

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,580
production they widen the attack surface

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,099
right and containers

65
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,620
share the same IP space they share the

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,000
host kernel space

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,640
so what happens is if an attacker gets

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,640
does performs container Escape he will

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,700
get access to the underlying hosts as

70
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,160
well as the other containers

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,060
and it's the same thing for the

72
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,920
pre-production pipeline where the

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,800
development is taking place right we

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,500
often Silo the testing

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,440
and the registry stage from the code

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
development and the developer laptop

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,379
monitoring

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,400
so

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,099
these days a lot of attacks are

80
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,560
targeting the developer laptops the

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
latest being a Dropbox right and what's

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,900
the reason the reason being

83
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,840
the groundwork is done by the developers

84
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,000
they build the software they have admin

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,519
privileges to different systems maybe

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,239
GitHub for example and

87
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,879
once the attackers enter your cicd

88
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,180
pipeline right they can exploit this to

89
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,480
move laterally around the network

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,680
and gain access to the end goal

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,120
so

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,519
there are few different ways how we can

93
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,319
enable security at the developer laptop

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,840
so this is the shift left approach why

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,659
not focus on security right when the

96
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,760
production starts rather than focusing

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,280
on security when uh the software is

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
actually running in production

99
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,120
so we can you know start with auditing

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,980
for vulnerable packages a lot of

101
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,019
developers use third-party libraries

102
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,200
right and also look for any malicious

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,819
Chrome extensions because there have

104
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,500
been cases where there was a spare

105
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,079
phishing attack because some developer

106
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,358
installed a malicious Chrome extension

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,240
then you have the zero trust access

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,199
right with the BYOD

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
you know remote working from home BYOD

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,600
policies we need to have something in

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,660
place which gives access to developers

112
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,660
to those critical systems that are

113
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,820
needed to perform their job and zero

114
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,340
trust is a great way because you know in

115
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,080
every

116
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,300
request is authenticated and then

117
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,800
authorized

118
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,380
and on the laptops itself we should have

119
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,960
a mechanism which is detecting

120
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,300
something malicious and taking probably

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,000
like remediative actions right

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
so just

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,919
um to wrap up I would say

124
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,740
the attackers don't think in silos when

125
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,780
they see your cicd pipeline or The

126
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,419
Innovation pipeline it's an ecosystem

127
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,860
and neither should

128
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,740
security practitioners like us should

129
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,419
think in silos we should not do like

130
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,500
that and for a good security right

131
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,740
developers don't need a security program

132
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
that hampers Innovation so a good

133
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,860
security program enables them to build a

134
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,740
secure running product in the cloud

135
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,199
uh thank you um like if you you know

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,000
would like to talk more about this have

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,039
more discussions uh please join us at

138
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,960
the Optics booth and you know we would

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,450
be happy to chat with you yeah

140
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,360
[Applause]
