1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,899
hey everyone thanks for joining this

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,420
panel discussion damaged fine zero touch

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,519
for cloud native applications

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,599
so before we go into topics what we are

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,460
going to discuss I would like to

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,940
introduce my panel here we're sitting

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,520
and then first I'll let all the stuff

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,460
before we go to the panel I just want to

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,039
highlight that all the topics presented

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,340
in this discussion related to uh

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,779
individual views not associated to any

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,000
organization

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
let me introduce myself I'm Kishore

security team and working on multiple

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,620
Cloud Technologies and solutions so as

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,539
you see here and I am a great good

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,239
advocator on the nsos and open source

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,700
projects and recently practicing in no

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,760
inclusive speaking so

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,820
and uh in my past I worked on a lot of

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,860
cloud multi-cloud digital transformation

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,500
projects and in

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
with that said I'm going to introduce

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,380
um I had Cloud security for TIAA um

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,180
including devsecops and application

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,180
security I am co-chair for cncf type

32

specialize in addressing challenges for

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,280
workload identity in multi-cloud and

hybrid Cloud scenarios

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,780
I have done several patterns in this

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,479
space and I'm the active contributor to

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
the open source I'm also a member of the

00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,880
zero trust working group under cncf

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,040
security tag thank you

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,079
hi everyone philographers from net

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,220
Foundry uh I do technical advocacy for

51
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,520
the company so talking to people pains

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,420
communities open source forums events

53
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,140
and lots of uh writing blogs and content

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,260
um that covers work that I do within the

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,500
cncf in the xero trust working group by

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,300
to do some stuff with the cloud security

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,280
Alliance and some of the Security based

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
places I'm generally a

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,160
a technical generalist so I know lots of

60
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,080
things about lots of different topics at

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,760
the moment very focused on zero trust

62
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,420
distributed systems and automating the

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,700
systems that we use

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,060
hi uh my name is Assad fazi I'm a

member of security tag the supply chain

74
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,940
and Security tax zero trust working

75
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,760
groups of cncf thank you

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,560
thanks everyone

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
so before I hand it over a couple of

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,300
questions to family list here I just

79
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,340
want to say the zero trust

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,680
has been there for years in the

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,019
different forms but no the failure of

82
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,200
traditional security models not working

83
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,239
as as you know a lot of workloads are

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,879
moving to Cloud native with that said no

85
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,340
uh some of the

86
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,280
hybrid hybrid ID contest is in place and

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
I want to pass it on to Aaron and say

88
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,659
ask a question that what is what is you

89
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,799
mean by zero trust and

90
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,159
why do you think everyone has to focus

91
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,379
thank you Kishore for that question

92
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,080
so as you all know zero trust is a

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,599
term used for evolving set of cyber

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,819
security paradigms which kind of break

95
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,860
the traditional model of network-based

96
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,540
security right at the perimeter

97
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,480
Enterprise perimeters are Vanishing

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,859
um and uh because

99
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,120
Enterprises are going to BYOD remote

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,459
access cloud cloud native Technologies

101
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,560
so you are in a distributed world of

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,300
connected software

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,820
so the main philosophy behind zero trust

104
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,380
is to not implicitly Grant any trust and

105
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,259
basal address Grant access so every

106
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,699
access is granted on a dynamic basis

107
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,520
um and um based on the attributes of the

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,979
user application and device

109
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,960
um and based on the context the decision

110
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,560
to allow access or deny access is made

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,560
again this as you said it's not a New

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,120
Concept it's just that in the new

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,280
paradigm the thread landscape growing so

114
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,440
much the traditional security methods

115
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,080
are not valid and zero trust literally

116
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,600
touches every part of the Enterprise ID

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,460
like Network and environment

118
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,820
applications users data devices

119
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,639
Automation and orchestration as well as

120
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,759
visibility and analytics when it comes

121
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,580
to the cloud native Technologies there

122
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,380
are descriptive languages you can use

123
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,259
hump charts terraform as well as you

124
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,080
know custom resource definitions to

125
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,060
pre-define the desired state of

126
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,100
infrastructure and applications that you

127
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,139
want in an interest in your environment

128
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,259
and that allows you to Define what type

129
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,020
of access and what application behavior

130
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,580
is except is desired or accepted

131
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,759
um so that is a a key enabler for zero

132
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,520
trust in Cloud native platforms

133
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,800
so with that um I think I'll hand it

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,479
back over to you

135
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,039
thanks Arana that was a great

136
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,380
perspective about Cloud native

137
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,560
so Mario's question to you what does

138
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,780
zero trust mean to any organization what

139
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,340
are the principles someone really need

140
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,280
to look into that okay thank you Kishore

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,100
for this uh zero trust like radna said

142
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,680
it's not a specific product or a single

143
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,900
tool it's more like a strategy so let me

144
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,180
give you example with covet we

145
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,360
experience a shift to a remote work and

146
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,060
now companies and organizations could no

147
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,479
longer rely on the perimeter control

148
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,479
meaning the implicit access based on

149
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,000
location to the building or to the

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,419
office whether physical on or network is

151
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,919
not sufficient anymore

152
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,900
so this is when the zero trust

153
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,139
principles really took off and this

154
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,819
leads to your second question what are

155
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,460
the principles of the zero trust so

156
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
first always verify never trust

157
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,300
eliminate implicit trust assume a breach

158
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,419
plan for compromised systems and

159
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,300
compromised elements a principle of

160
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,280
least privilege that we'll talk about

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,680
this in a second

162
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,940
authenticate and authorize each

163
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,940
operation before the connection can be

164
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,000
established use the strong identity like

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,360
x509 certificates so in one sentence

166
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,560
right user has access to write data for

167
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,500
the right reasons at the right time

168
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,960
so back to you Kishore what does this

169
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,680
all mean for the cloud native world

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
when we say cloud native arm before

171
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
Cloud native traditional people are used

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
to be traditional VMS and they were when

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,419
they are migrating uh the VMS to from

174
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,639
the Legacy servers to VM and the

175
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,199
firewalls are pretty easy I know they

176
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,900
followed what what was their Implement

177
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,699
what was implemented in Legacy servers

178
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,160
but when we say cloud native most of the

179
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,780
workloads are moving to microservices

180
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,979
Containers Etc so micro services are

181
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,780
under containers are short-lived and

182
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,120
then you need to you need to deal with

183
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,900
the

184
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,419
the security are all together

185
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,020
differently so when we have this short

186
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,479
layout containers we need to have these

187
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,440
policies and the the firewalls are no

188
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,020
giving access to these workloads needs

189
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,720
to be created separately so that's where

190
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,639
we we need to have a strict verification

191
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,819
what this pod or container can really

192
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,340
talk to other workloads within the

193
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,160
network outside and network Etc not only

194
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,379
that you know when we deploying these

195
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,599
workloads into the cloud our multi-cloud

196
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,059
and hybrid Cloud environment we need to

197
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,799
make sure your continuous delivery

198
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,339
pipeline goes also having implementing

199
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,640
necessary security controls and last but

200
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,500
not least when we are deploying the

201
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,360
parts

202
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,160
there is no IPS IPS or constants

203
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,899
changing so you cannot Define the fire

204
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,019
firewalls on top of eyepiece so you need

205
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,260
to have the policies which is beyond

206
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,839
which these policies needs to go with

207
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,740
tables and all the DNS

208
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Etc so don't use it rather than using IP

209
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,120
addresses so the Security

210
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,200
Professionals needs to change their

211
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,940
perspective instead of using IP

212
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,519
addresses

213
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,839
change their their implementation

214
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,580
solutions to

215
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,459
implementation solution to no Cloud

216
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,339
native security procedures no that's all

217
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,260
I can say about Cloud Network

218
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,720
approach

219
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
so with that said right I would like to

220
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,839
pass on to Philip to talk about what are

221
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,339
the building blocks since we'd already

222
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,440
talked about zero trust and Cloud native

223
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
and all that stuff what do you think is

224
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,680
able to know some of the building blocks

225
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,380
somebody needs to consider

226
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,339
yes questions thanks Kishore for me it

227
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,800
very much maps to

228
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,600
um the the definitions of the pillars

229
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,360
within xero trust so I think one of one

230
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
of the the foundational ones is is

231
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,240
identity

232
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,440
how do we uh provide x509 certificates

233
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,740
and use jwts so that as you say instead

234
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,140
of trusting IP addresses we can have we

235
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,240
can have strong identity as as root for

236
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
the Weber We Trust something or not a

237
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,100
component of the the the platform and

238
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,140
that that that's both the platforms

239
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,940
that's that's the platform it's also

240
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,940
workloads it's also users because we're

241
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,279
seeing our platforms being distributed

242
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,440
Beyond just you know multi-cloud but

243
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,839
also into Edge iot and and you know

244
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,760
users accessing those applications as

245
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,920
well we then have to consider whatever

246
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,720
workload within this system of this

247
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,459
platform that's part of the operations

248
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,080
or it's connecting in how do we make

249
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,660
sure that workload is protected you know

250
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,700
with your protecting against next

251
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,000
Generation threats viruses malware you

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,660
know Etc then we need to consider how

253
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,640
the applications are developed how we

254
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,200
make sure the software development

255
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,500
pipeline ensures that we're not bringing

256
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,019
in vulnerabilities how we may make sure

257
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,300
we can we can potentially run those

258
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,399
applications in a secure Enclave in

259
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,380
production so that we're giving the

260
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,260
runtime less trust and how we can how we

261
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,779
can automate uh that full process from

262
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,760
from from left development to right

263
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,300
production you've then got the network

264
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,760
um between this so as you said again we

265
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
don't want to trust IP addresses because

266
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,640
they're Dynamic they're not they're not

267
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,800
static they change around it's it's it's

268
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,560
distributed so we need to build an

269
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,779
overlay Network or a service mesh that

270
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,660
enables us to to ensure strong identity

271
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,180
micro segmentation least privilege

272
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,860
authentication authorization before

273
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,180
connection all those those wonderful

274
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,940
principles and then we need to ensure

275
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,320
that we have visibility and monitoring

276
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,779
of the solution so that we can control

277
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,180
policy governance and then I think as

278
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,519
well there's there's there's almost the

279
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,680
overarching bit of how do all these

280
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,779
things integrate they cannot be single

281
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,540
point Solutions there needs to be a way

282
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,760
in which you tie them all together so

283
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,500
that you have for example if if uh you

284
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,399
know if you don't have that strong

285
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,079
identity you can't get on to to the

286
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,660
overlay Network or if you're your end

287
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,000
point or host has been compromised it's

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,700
removed and revoked access and it's by

289
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,620
bringing these blocks together and then

290
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,600
building that whole sum that we're able

291
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,880
to to build zero trust principles into

292
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,660
our Cloud native platforms

293
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,260
thanks Philly I think uh I think talking

294
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,240
about micro segmentation and controlling

295
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
the policies and is a great thing to

296
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,360
have Asad do you think any other

297
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,740
building block somebody needs to

298
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,720
consider on their Cloud native journey

299
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,820
by implementing zero test

300
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,060
uh sure thanks thanks Kishore I tend to

301
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,600
speak uh very quickly so fast so I'll

302
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,220
try to slow down today so that you can

303
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,200
understand everybody can understand

304
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,060
Philip has done a great job laying down

305
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,399
the foundation but I want to talk about

306
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,920
three key building blocks of zero trust

307
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,899
and Cloud native application

308
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,600
one is the access base control

309
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,180
2 is the data encryption and least

310
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,940
privilege access and three continuous

311
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,700
monitoring access based control is the

312
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,380
key aspect of zero trust and Cloud

313
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,480
native publication

314
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,579
it is a security model in which access

315
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,860
to resources is granted only on need to

316
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,380
know basis and all access is verified

317
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,779
and continuously monitored

318
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,700
this is in contrast to the traditional

319
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,399
security model which rely on

320
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,540
perimeter-based security and Trust all

321
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,540
devices and users within the perimeter

322
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,100
in a cloud-native environment

323
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,200
access-based control can be implemented

324
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,899
using identity and access management IIM

325
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,540
Solutions these Solutions are used to

326
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,160
manage and verify the identities of

327
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
users and devices accessing the network

328
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,839
this includes user authentication and

329
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,600
authorization as well as a multi-factor

330
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,519
authentication MFA and single sign-on

331
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,639
SSL capabilities overall

332
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,860
access based control is a crucial aspect

333
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,139
of trust zero trust in Cloud native

334
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,540
application as it helps to ensure that

335
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,760
only authorized users and devices have

336
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
access to the sensitive Resources by

337
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,660
implementing access Waste Control

338
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,820
organization can reduce the risk of

339
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,220
security incidents and make it more

340
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,899
difficult for attackers to compromise

341
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,660
the system access Waste Control can also

342
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,240
be used to enforce least privileged

343
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,860
access and Cloud native application

344
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,560
which limits access to the minimum

345
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,260
necessary to perform a task and revoke

346
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,720
access as soon as it is no longer needed

347
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
access to data is granted only on a need

348
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,000
to know basis and all access is verified

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,700
and continuously monitored this includes

350
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,740
granting access to specific resources

351
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,740
such as data or application or limiting

352
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,500
access to specific actions such as read

353
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,959
or write access then that is data

354
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,660
encryption both in transit and at rest

355
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,940
to protect it from unauthorized access

356
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,300
this can include using encryption for

357
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,360
data store uh in stored in the cloud as

358
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,980
well as encryption for data stored in

359
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,260
the device or in transit across the

360
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,980
network

361
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,680
continuous monitoring is an essential

362
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,720
component of zero trust implementation

363
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,060
in Cloud native application it is the

364
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,860
process of continuously monitoring the

365
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,380
network for suspicious activities and

366
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,240
taking action to prevent

367
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,940
and respond to security threats overall

368
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,579
access based control is a crucial aspect

369
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:24,959
of zero trust in Cloud native

370
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,540
application by implementing access-based

371
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,480
controls organization can reduce the

372
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,579
risk of security incidents and make it

373
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,199
more difficult for attackers to

374
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,480
compromise the system back to you for

375
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,260
sure

376
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,600
thank you thank you for your detail uh

377
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,220
explanation about all those billion

378
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,579
blocks Philippa and basal Arana back to

379
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,160
you heard about the cloud native and

380
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,899
building blocks you know what he was

381
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,240
talking about it so with all this said

382
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,279
what are the challenges somebody needs

383
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,199
to think about it to implement zero

384
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,399
trust

385
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,899
interesting question

386
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,660
um lots of challenges in my opinion

387
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,120
so IP addresses have been Central to the

388
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,760
traditional network security when you go

389
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,600
to Cloud

390
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,579
they're not visible they're ephemeral

391
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,920
they're constantly changing and you add

392
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,959
kubernetes to that where you have

393
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,180
Dynamic ephemeral resources which are

394
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,579
spinning up and spinning down very

395
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:18,779
quickly

396
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,600
um securing all of this and the paste at

397
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
which it happens is quite challenging

398
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,920
that's the first thing and kubernetes

399
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,880
itself is you know wide open you are

400
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,560
required to figure out how to secure

401
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,300
your kubernetes platform the control

402
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,899
plane the data plane and the apis and

403
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,699
all the interfaces and then you're

404
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,920
required to literally you should have

405
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
another overlay on top of it to further

406
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,660
improve your micro segmentation even

407
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,880
though kubernetes provides network

408
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880
security policies that you can deploy

409
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,620
and how kubernetes works

410
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,380
I mean Cloud native we have serverless

411
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,480
and we have other Technologies as part

412
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,980
of it too but the heart of the problem

413
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,019
is still kubernetes right kubernetes is

414
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,980
the underlying technology in kubernetes

415
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,220
um the designers are expected

416
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,400
um to figure out all their controls

417
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,980
um for this and then in the cicd

418
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,020
pipeline pre-deployment all the checks

419
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,520
you have to do right

420
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,380
um software supply chain security making

421
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,179
sure all the third party libraries are

422
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,919
integrated properly and all the policies

423
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,319
infrastructure as code policies that

424
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,000
you're deploying the istio manifests and

425
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,700
the yaml validation that you need to do

426
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,760
and then in runtime you need controls as

427
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,260
well right

428
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,780
um so it is it creates a very Dynamic

429
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,179
environment and lots of components to

430
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,580
manage and kubernetes essentially

431
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,559
it doesn't it it doesn't take the

432
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,660
context of a Enterprise Network right

433
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,280
there are no IP addresses there's no

434
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,320
fixed boundaries these are ephemeral

435
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,140
Dynamic services and basically the

436
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,299
security the way it works is it it just

437
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,160
keeps track of who's doing what and when

438
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,380
right and when you have thousands of

439
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,360
these Services dynamically spinning up

440
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,880
that creates a whole different Paradigm

441
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,760
of security that you need to address

442
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,220
um and all these policies and keeping

443
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,260
track of these policies constantly and

444
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,539
updating them dynamically to keep your

445
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,460
environment secure brings a whole

446
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,460
different damage in our security to a

447
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,100
cloud native platform and the technology

448
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,200
is still evolving right every day we

449
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,700
have new threads and we need to figure

450
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,460
out how to mitigate those and

451
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,380
um like Assad said this continuous

452
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,539
monitoring monitoring we have in all

453
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,280
systems we're in Cloud native you have

454
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
to use that monitoring and intelligence

455
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,299
to feed back into your policies so

456
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,940
you're continually raising the bar in

457
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,559
terms of security of your platform so

458
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,860
all these complexities we bring great

459
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,780
challenges for the Enterprise is to

460
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,059
secure them thanks Dynamic can you

461
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,919
remind constantly changing Technologies

462
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,380
thanks for all those pointing

463
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,140
so Maria's back to you

464
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,820
with all the challenges aradhana

465
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,559
mentioned and what all the topics we

466
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,600
talked about do you ever see is there a

467
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,940
golden Power to implement not your

468
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,340
request hey golden pass to zero trust

469
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,100
okay well let's start with identity yeah

470
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,380
users they have to be authenticated and

471
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,900
authorized to be able to do anything in

472
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,419
the cloud and there is nothing new even

473
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,880
across multi-clouds we already have

474
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,179
Concepts like single sign-on and that's

475
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,360
problem already solved the interesting

476
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,160
challenge however is the workload

477
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,980
Identity microservices or containers

478
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,260
that represent the service need to

479
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,539
communicate with each other they access

480
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:41,400
apis they pull data make calls Etc and

481
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,440
with the zero trust each transaction

482
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,100
must be explicitly authorized so every

483
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,039
cloud handles identity in Fairly similar

484
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,919
way it comes with IAM identity and

485
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,260
access management that is integrated

486
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,520
with the platform this identity provider

487
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,280
consists of certificate Authority or

488
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,980
root of trust to provision identities

489
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,740
for workloads when the container wants

490
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,620
to access a service or database it takes

491
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,620
that identity in form of the x509

492
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,820
certificate

493
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,640
and presents it to policy enforcement

494
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,580
point which verifies this identity with

495
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,039
identity service and then based on the

496
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,220
policies it either grants or rejects the

497
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,419
access

498
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,360
so when the organization uses multiple

499
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,419
different Cloud providers Things become

500
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,820
even more interesting the containers

501
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,539
need to be able to securely communicate

502
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,240
not only with each other but also

503
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,580
between different clouds so how do we do

504
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,059
it we cannot use static key because the

505
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,720
key generated like API key is long lived

506
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,600
and we lose control of it when the

507
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,280
system is compromised

508
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,799
we don't know how many copies of the key

509
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,559
were created who actually has access to

510
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,260
the key and to move the API key between

511
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,140
clouds it often requires a human to

512
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,960
perform this action so we put a lot of

513
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,900
trust in a person that mess that must be

514
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,440
certified to handle certain data for

515
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,780
compliance reasons so we could

516
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,780
potentially use Federation the idea is

517
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,740
that we teach IEM system of one Cloud

518
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,900
how to interpret identities of another

519
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,480
Cloud that is calling the service

520
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,080
but support for local identity

521
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,500
Federation across clouds varies virtual

522
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,720
identities are defined differently by

523
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,059
different Cloud providers they don't

524
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,820
necessarily translate well across clouds

525
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,299
and since the schemas are different it

526
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,460
makes very difficult to establish a

527
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,520
trust relationship or to make meaningful

528
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,640
access policies and finally since

529
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,919
Federation has to be done between each

530
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,640
Cloud as the organization scales up the

531
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,679
configuration management becomes a

532
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,380
nightmare it's a quadratic complexity

533
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,659
so to solve this we can use something

534
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,419
like Spire that manages worker

535
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,059
identities between clouds in Universal

536
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,600
way since Cloud since its cloud provider

537
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,860
agnostic

538
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,380
and there is no more hard-coded static

539
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,640
keys

540
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,039
then we can support common identity

541
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,799
schemas that are not tied to any

542
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,740
specific cloud and that simplifies this

543
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,679
access policies all these examples all

544
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,919
the solutions are based on cncf projects

545
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,440
and we covered this in details in our

546
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,840
white paper so please check our work

547
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,720
yeah there is however another challenge

548
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,960
the workload identity is tied to

549
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,480
kubernetes to the platform or to the

550
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,159
cloud provider

551
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,620
so can we really trust the host

552
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,620
do we know what's running there

553
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,000
underlying software stack might be

554
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,179
tampered with what about the on-prem or

555
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,299
Edge deployments can we trust those well

556
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,960
we do attestation we can attest the node

557
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,419
that is hosting the workload to

558
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,480
guarantee its identity Beyond any doubt

559
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I'll test the software stack all the way

560
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,200
from booting all the way to Kernel

561
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,600
and force the software bill of materials

562
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,900
we can measure and enforce the Integrity

563
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,280
of the files

564
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,039
and we could revoke when the attestation

565
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,299
fails

566
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,059
all this attestation aspects including

567
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,940
the hardware route of Trust cover well

568
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,020
in our paper so I hope this helps so now

569
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,740
Philip can you tell us about Network

570
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,179
infrastructure applications you have

571
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,580
Network aspect definitely I think the

572
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,340
the the starting point is how how we how

573
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,679
we Implement our zero trust networking

574
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,860
principles to cover communication with

575
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,440
the objective that we can ensure safe

576
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,220
fast and reliable communication and

577
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,500
virtualization of the what network to

578
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,000
whatever resources are in our system

579
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,460
whether it's a client to server for for

580
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,840
example someone accessing the kubernetes

581
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,179
API or or server to server with clusters

582
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,000
communicating or machine to server as we

583
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,820
move into iot and its use cases and and

584
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,400
picking up from where you started what's

585
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,840
really fundamental is that you start

586
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,179
with identity such as an X5 a nice

587
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,059
certificate so that you're doing

588
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,799
authorization and your initial point of

589
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,120
trust based upon that rather than uh IP

590
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,980
addresses and once we are ensuring that

591
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,140
all communication is take taking place

592
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,900
on the basis of mutually authenticated

593
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,600
identities to establish connections we

594
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,159
can also start looking at how we can

595
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,200
Implement authentication authorization

596
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
before connectivity that's almost the

597
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,340
opposite of how most networks operate

598
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,320
you send a packet and goes well should I

599
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,600
let it in no you like you should be

600
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,380
authenticating that the thing has access

601
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,760
to the data plane before it's able to

602
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,380
get access to the data plane so we're

603
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,120
really following a software-defined

604
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,980
network in architecture we're splitting

605
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,600
those two things the control plane the

606
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,679
data plane

607
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,440
we're then further able to implement

608
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,440
application micro segmentation where we

609
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,299
can do attribute-based access control

610
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,520
and least privilege you know to to

611
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
specific IP addresses or specific

612
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,500
identities or or specific uh DNS and

613
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,320
other uh aspects of how our applications

614
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,539
want to communicate and potentially even

615
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,240
down to a specific service which can

616
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,279
have a you know zero trust networking

617
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,340
built into that application

618
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,559
and this enables us to get to a point

619
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,580
where we can create a network which is

620
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,460
closed by default rather than opened by

621
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,320
default as traditional networks were

622
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,659
built and this should all be built in a

623
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,440
way that is driven by software and apis

624
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,620
so that we're ensuring that we can have

625
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,100
the agility of distributed systems and

626
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,860
to be able to move as fast as the

627
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,080
software developers and and platform

628
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,320
wants to move in itself in a way that

629
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,440
um is highly automated once we start

630
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,299
being able to achieve that then we start

631
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,460
being able to eliminate traditional

632
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,500
Network and approaches like you know

633
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,900
Access Control lists and you know

634
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,779
whitelisting inbound uh IPS on your

635
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,960
firewall and vpns and you know other

636
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,000
such things so that we we make it much

637
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,919
simpler and

638
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,320
there is various aspects which are

639
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,640
covered in our white paper which would

640
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,620
be great to have people looking at and

641
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,120
it really you know there's different

642
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,260
Technologies which can do this whether

643
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,700
you're talking about service meshes

644
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,840
whether you're talking about zero trust

645
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,520
overlay networks

646
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,500
um some API gateways have the ability to

647
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,299
implement parts of this as well and it

648
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,640
really becomes a question of how do I

649
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,900
want to implement what are the pros and

650
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,960
cons I'm looking for and a quick comment

651
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,000
um we should highlight that

652
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,520
um just having micro segmentation based

653
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,620
on istio service mesh and you know all

654
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,020
traffic encrypted between

655
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,720
um applications and services it also

656
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,419
prevents reduces and attack surface

657
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,100
greatly if one application gets

658
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,679
compromised rest of your real estate of

659
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,539
applications and microservices is still

660
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,640
secure and that's the advantage that

661
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,500
istio provides and istio has evolved

662
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,799
quite a bit over the last few years and

663
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,960
now they are they are even you can even

664
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,720
enforce applications security policies

665
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,460
in SEO right

666
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,860
um and so on and so forth so just wanted

667
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,220
to highlight that

668
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,980
no totally I I understand that uh so

669
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,039
Marius and Philip has covered quite a

670
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,860
bit in in great details and done a

671
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,799
wonderful job of covering the aspects of

672
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,260
golden path like for example Mario's

673
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,120
covered identity

674
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,940
um and um attestation Philip is covered

675
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,620
Network an environment micro

676
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,559
segmentation uh it's a tough act to

677
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,020
follow but uh I believe there is no one

678
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,840
golden path to implement zero trust for

679
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,940
cloud native application for for every

680
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,919
organization but there are some general

681
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,520
guidelines that organizations can follow

682
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,200
at the heart of zero trust is a

683
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,500
principle of least privileged access it

684
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,820
is implemented in Cloud native

685
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,640
application by controlling and managing

686
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,380
access to the resources

687
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,960
this ensures that only authorized users

688
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,940
have access to the sensitive data and

689
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,220
that access is limited to the minimum

690
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,159
necessary to perform a task this can be

691
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,600
achieved through a combination of

692
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,659
different security controls in including

693
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,659
number one while IM is used to manage

694
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,360
and uh and control access to resources

695
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,400
at the level of individual users and

696
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,460
devices are back on the other hand is a

697
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,440
system that is used to control access to

698
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,960
resources at the level of roles and

699
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,539
permissions it is used to define roles

700
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,059
that specify the actions that users or

701
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,220
group of users are allowed to perform on

702
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,960
specific resources

703
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,539
our back for example is used to control

704
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,340
access to resources in a kubernetes

705
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,440
cluster

706
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,159
Philip has already covered micro

707
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,159
segmentation so I'm going to skip that I

708
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,779
talked about data encryption earlier

709
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,840
both in transit and address including in

710
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,679
the cloud on devices and in transit in

711
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,480
Cloud native application is important

712
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,240
since it ensures that even if the data

713
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,880
is compromised it will be unreadable

714
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,700
without the encryption keys

715
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,760
a strong encryption algorithms like AES

716
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,159
and RSA can be used for data encryption

717
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,980
encryption keys can be managed

718
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,860
and protected to ensure that they are

719
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,260
not compromised and can only be accessed

720
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,059
by authorized personnel

721
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,760
Cloud native environment is dynamic

722
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,520
and it is essential to have real-time

723
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,980
visibility and monitoring to enforce the

724
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,320
zero trust access based control in a

725
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,120
cloud-native environment continuous

726
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,559
monitoring can be achieved through the

727
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,539
use of security information and event

728
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,120
management Siem systems security

729
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,640
orchestration Automation and response

730
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,860
soar platforms and other security

731
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,559
monitoring tools these tools can be used

732
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,899
to collect analyze and correlate

733
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,640
security related data from various

734
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,919
sources in Cloud native application

735
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,799
access logs and auditing are used to

736
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,840
track and monitor access to data and

737
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,159
resources

738
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,020
this allows organizations to identify

739
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,179
investigate any suspicious access

740
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,640
attempts and quickly respond to any

741
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,580
security incidents by implementing these

742
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,320
security controls organization can

743
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,899
ensure that only authorized users and

744
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,700
devices have access to sensitive data

745
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,399
and that access is limited to minimum

746
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,700
necessary to perform a task back to you

747
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,659
Kishore

748
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,580
thanks aside

749
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,419
uh thank you everyone and now the golden

750
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,460
path approach with all the billion

751
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,140
blocks you guys provided is a great

752
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,360
value for that teams who are listening

753
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,659
here so now Aaron you heard about Golden

754
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,360
path will uh building blocks and then

755
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,360
summary of cloud native Technologies

756
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,580
how somebody is working on a cloud

757
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,039
native applications are the organization

758
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,260
can take this one further

759
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,899
what are the first thing they have to do

760
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,899
you want to summarize this

761
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,240
um yeah in short I think um everybody

762
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,399
has to go to zero trust eventually

763
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,360
because

764
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,700
um now it's a mandate from president

765
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,559
cyber security executive order

766
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,059
especially if you're doing business to

767
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,380
the government

768
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,960
um and the threat landscape has evolved

769
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,299
so much every every organization is

770
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,720
targeting or at least is working towards

771
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,559
um

772
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,899
zero trust specially with all the

773
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,539
ransomware attacks and those threats as

774
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,539
well they have increased quite a bit

775
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:54,299
um and if the organizations are in the

776
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,580
cloud native platforms already then they

777
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,320
have golden paths right they know what

778
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,779
is secure and and the more you can do on

779
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,940
the pre-deployment side and force

780
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,799
identities validates your software

781
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,440
supply chain security and force policies

782
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,720
for what can be deployed and what is

783
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,640
your desired State and what application

784
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,240
can access what services or what data or

785
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,640
what users or devices

786
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,860
um can access what applications and

787
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,799
Services I think that desired State as

788
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,460
the more we can Enterprises can identify

789
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,520
and Define upfront the easier it becomes

790
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,460
but again this is an evolution this uh

791
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,620
zero trust is not the first day you know

792
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,419
there's no easy button that overnight

793
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,419
you are zero trust and these policies

794
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,240
will grow evolve over time but you start

795
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,279
somewhere right even to grow and evolve

796
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,240
you need to start taking some baseline

797
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,620
controls and policies deploy them in

798
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,360
your pipeline and in your runtime

799
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,460
environment start Gathering intelligence

800
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,380
and as you get more and more feedback

801
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,080
you enhance those policies you know

802
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,779
having strong identity and

803
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,720
authentication uh infrastructure is

804
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,940
important you need to have uh you know

805
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,600
like Maria said Federation and

806
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,140
um you know open ID connect and spvid is

807
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,299
to be able to enforce and or identify

808
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,120
applications in the runtime right and

809
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,360
the whole image programs validation in

810
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,279
the runtime of what images are in your

811
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,440
repository and what are the running in

812
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,960
the runtime as well as how you are

813
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,240
securing your repos what gets into your

814
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,039
repos who has access to what India

815
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,140
Reapers I think these are some basic

816
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,480
hygiene best practices in a cloud native

817
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,580
platform that will help you to get

818
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,679
towards zero trust but the more you can

819
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,380
Define the desired State upfront who

820
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,240
access is what and how they are

821
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,460
segmented and what policies need to be

822
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,039
deployed for what what workloads

823
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,080
I think easier it gets for the

824
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,179
Enterprises to be able to achieve zero

825
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,679
trust over time

826
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,260
thanks Arna I think you know start small

827
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,360
and improve on top of it that's a great

828
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,260
advice

829
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,019
so with that said I'm going to share my

830
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,559
screen back

831
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,219
so that concludes our panel discussion

832
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,418
here

833
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,639
and

834
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,639
foreign
