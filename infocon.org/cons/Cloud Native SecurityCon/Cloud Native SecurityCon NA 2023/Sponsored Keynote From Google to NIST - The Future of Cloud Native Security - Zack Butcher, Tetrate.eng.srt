1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
hey everybody

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,259
welcome welcome

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,720
um you know we've had a bunch of folks

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,519
up here today kind of already talk about

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,260
some of the industry practices that are

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,420
getting better and I think this is super

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,340
exciting right we're seeing security

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,279
teams more empowered with more budget to

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,260
be able to go effect change than ever

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,880
before for example

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,400
we're seeing at lower layers in the

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,400
stack better infrastructure options and

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,439
defaults right cloud provider

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,300
deployments are much more secure than

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,579
they used to be we're getting better at

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,460
locking down the lower layers

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,160
the renewed focus on software supply

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,379
chain and s-bomb is great we don't quite

19
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,840
know what to do with s-bombs yet uh you

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,340
know that's kind of one of the the big

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,340
pain points today but we are developing

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,460
tools and practices around that that

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,579
again should have big impact on how we

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,100
deliver software securely

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,800
and some of the other efforts that we're

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,260
seeing across the the landscape include

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,199
moving to you know runtime asserted

28
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,840
computer verified

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
uh checks that we're implementing

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,979
controls rather than you know a checkbox

31
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,799
that we did once every year right

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,240
projects like oscal the open source

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,340
compliance assessment language help

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,439
drive this Automation and this computer

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,158
verification

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,560
net of all of this is that security is

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,840
moving up the stack uh Brian earlier

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,580
talked about a bunch of attack vectors

39
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,920
that they're that they're looking at and

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,080
you know none of them were the attacker

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,880
got on the network and talked directly

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,140
to the database and egressed a bunch of

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,600
data right much more sophisticated

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,780
attacks now and the policy that we want

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,000
to write to be able to mitigate and and

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,240
time box uh and you know limit the space

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,119
of an attacker needs to be more and more

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,119
application context aware we need to

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,860
move that closer to the to the

50
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,780
application things like identity based

51
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,640
policy moving up from network based

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,079
policy is one way that we can do that

53
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,119
but there's a ton more that we need to

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,720
start to apply

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,080
zero trust itself isn't a mystery

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,239
there's a lot of fun around what zero

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,300
trust is uh you know it's fundamentally

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,360
two things it's people process and it's

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,920
runtime controls

60
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,739
that answer and mitigate the question

61
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,660
what if the attacker is already inside

62
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,340
the network

63
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,099
around 2009 actually is when the the

64
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,319
original kind of zero trust write-ups uh

65
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,879
came out that's when the the terms

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,040
started to appear and that happens to

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,220
coincide very closely with some leaks uh

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,620
where we found out that actually for

69
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,840
quite a lot of major companies somebody

70
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,040
was in the network

71
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,500
that's what motivates a lot of of the

72
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,700
the zero trust ideology today right

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,440
so I want to make this a little bit more

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,420
concrete though so just talking about

75
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,340
runtime not the people process side

76
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,379
there's a lot of kind of mystery around

77
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,300
zero trust and I really want to boil it

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,640
down to something that we can kind of

79
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,319
use as a litmus test for the for the

80
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,420
rest of this conference right there are

81
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,519
five policy checks at a minimum that we

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,720
should be doing

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,940
if we want to call our system you know

84
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,260
zero trust so we want to start to

85
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,739
realize that idea of mitigating what an

86
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,000
attacker who's already inside the

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,760
perimeter can do and those five policy

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,459
checks are here we need you know we need

89
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,200
authenticity of our messages and that

90
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
they can't be eavesdropped we need

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
encryption and Transit

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,659
we need service level identity that we

93
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,640
can authenticate at runtime ideally we

94
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,680
want a cryptographic identity

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
we want to be able to use those

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,239
identities to do runtime service to

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,099
service authorization

98
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,140
to control which workloads can talk to

99
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,060
each other

100
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,340
then we want to be able to take the end

101
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,200
user into account as well we want to we

102
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,239
need to be authenticating the end user

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,260
in session

104
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,659
and we need to be authorizing the

105
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,580
actions they are taking on resources in

106
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,840
the system

107
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,480
and all of this is not new right if you

108
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,560
look at you know things like API

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,940
gateways and Ingress gateways and

110
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,700
similar we we do these checks usually

111
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,620
but we need to be doing them not just at

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,080
the front door but every single hop in

113
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,760
our infrastructure every single time

114
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,978
anything is communicating we need to be

115
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,019
applying at minimum these five checks

116
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,900
and this is an area where there's active

117
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,600
standards that are evolving we're going

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,580
to introduce in a little bit later talk

119
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,620
this idea of this identity based

120
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,419
segmentation and using that to realize

121
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,240
as ETA come check that out uh basically

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
immediately after the break after

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,740
Keynotes in room 609 and that's we'll

124
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,020
dig into those five runtime checks and a

125
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,880
lot more besides

126
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,780
and with that thank you all

127
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,750
[Applause]
