1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,080
all right so uh I'm Mike Lieberman and

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
uh we're going to talk about uh tag

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,820
Securities uh software supply chain uh

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,139
working group here

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,580
all right

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,900
um

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,960
a little bit about myself

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,080
um I'm Mike Lieberman I am a co-founder

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,939
of a supply chain security startup

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,279
called uh kusari

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,300
um

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,900
I am also a salsa steering committee

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,099
member for folks who are familiar with

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,679
sort of the salsa supply chain security

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,600
standard

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,020
um I am a cncf tag security lead and I

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,719
helped co-lead the cncf secure software

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,160
Factory reference architecture which

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,219
we'll talk a little bit later

20
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,500
here and so for about you know the next

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,020
half hour or so I'll rant to you about

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,719
how great uh tag Securities software

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,360
supply chain working group is and um you

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,980
know hopefully convince some of you who

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,680
aren't already contributing to help

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,079
contribute

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,300
so first off for those who don't know

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,979
and um

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,680
what what is tag security well I mean

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
you're at a cloud native security con

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,820
hopefully you know but if you don't

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,280
um it's what it says on the Tim it's the

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,740
security technical Advisory Group for uh

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,439
the cloud native Computing Foundation

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,540
it's made up of motivated uh volunteers

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,820
interested in and contributing to Cloud

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,799
native security so just to be clear it's

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,580
not purely Security Experts myself I

39
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,680
started joining tag security when I was

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
at an end user company I was at a giant

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,180
Bank just sort of interested in security

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,000
and now hey I'm I'm up here talking

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,380
about it

44
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,500
so for folks who are you know not sure

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,320
uh no feel free to join we're interested

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
in everybody uh uh joining

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,060
um we're also tax security is also the

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,880
largest cncf technical Advisory Group

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,399
and um we also have the best mascot

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,939
Okay so what is the

51
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,399
um secure uh sorry the software supply

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,098
chain security uh working group in the

53
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,879
in-tech security well it's a subgroup

54
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,599
um

55
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,360
with tag security being so large we have

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,580
a lot of different work streams one of

57
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,800
them being software supply chain

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,900
security we also have a controls working

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,700
group we have a zero trust working group

60
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,940
that is along with a few others

61
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,459
so because uh software supply chain

62
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,440
security is so nascent it's such a new

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,020
thing we're not just you know helping

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,620
out with uh you know fixing supply chain

65
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,900
security we're helping to find it in the

66
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,000
larger space

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,980
and we have contributors who sort of you

68
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,379
know across the Spectrum we have you

69
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,019
know folks from end user organizations

70
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,120
folks from giant Banks folks from

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,700
insurance companies and all that as well

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,800
as you know folks like myself who are

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,200
now at a startup

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,700
um and we have folks from like larger

75
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,120
institutions like IBM Google and so on

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,980
uh across multiple Industries

77
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,280
so let's talk a little bit what we've

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,980
done in uh the past

79
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,959
and we'll kind of I'll be switching back

80
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,760
and forth between uh the presentation

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,319
here just to kind of show off some of

82
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,940
what we've done

83
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,060
so uh going through right we we have an

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,280
ongoing supply chain compromise list so

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,860
this is just sort of a list of known

86
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,420
supply chain incidents and we have

87
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,640
write-ups on the supply chain incidents

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,560
and and interesting facts about them

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,420
we've uh have it we wrote up a software

90
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,099
supply chain security best practices

91
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,560
guide uh which is you know once again

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,840
focused on that cloud native uh security

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,060
you know aspect right like it's not just

94
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,280
purely open source it's about how can we

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,040
secure uh the supply chains working

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,019
inside of uh applications like

97
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,580
kubernetes or application platforms like

98
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,200
kubernetes

99
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,480
we've also built out a secure software

100
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,519
Factory reference architecture which I I

101
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,080
helped co-lead

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,060
um which is based around you know trying

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,799
to figure out how do we you know

104
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,120
securely build

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,420
and and you know protect against attacks

106
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,400
that we've seen with stuff like uh you

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,639
know the solar winds style attack

108
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,639
uh We've also created a cncf project

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,639
supply chain security survey which is um

110
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,300
focused around uh trying to see within

111
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,979
the cncf what are some of the big

112
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,860
challenges that some of the uh various

113
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,720
cncf projects are running into from

114
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,759
supply chain security

115
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,919
and then we've also collaborated with a

116
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,500
lot of other cncf groups including stuff

117
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,300
like the tag security controls working

118
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,160
group to try and take some of those best

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,460
practices and turn them into uh controls

120
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,020
and then in addition to that we also

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,199
could collaborate across the LF uh with

122
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,639
other organizations like the CD

123
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,820
foundation and openssf on projects like

124
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,860
some of their supply chain security

125
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,139
stuff like at the CD Foundation as well

126
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,919
as projects like salsa which is a supply

127
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,060
chain security standard

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,720
so let's uh

129
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,660
actually before doing this let me show

130
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,320
off a little bit of uh one of the other

131
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,780
things here give me one second all right

132
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,100
you sorry so many tabs

133
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,520
here we go so here is the catalog of

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,460
supply chain compromises coming from

135
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,340
our group and so there's a whole bunch

136
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,560
of stuff here it's an open sort of uh

137
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,979
thing so we we are accept PRS and and we

138
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,860
actually if you have for example here um

139
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,259
if you look at the issues there's lots

140
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,720
of folks who have opened up issues here

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,460
to sort of say hey here's another

142
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,820
compromise we found and uh that ends up

143
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,580
in this catalog and in addition to here

144
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,080
we actually have a bunch of you know if

145
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,419
we click on one of these let's just say

146
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,280
the vs code one there's a bunch of

147
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,220
write-ups on sort of the impact and what

148
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,960
type of compromise additional references

149
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,400
and those sorts of things that we found

150
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,259
that it's very useful for folks who are

151
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,940
interested in understanding more about

152
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,100
what types of supply chain attacks are

153
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,660
there and what's happened in the past

154
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,880
and we're also looking to sort of

155
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,340
collaborate with other groups like The

156
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,020
open ssf to make this more than just

157
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,479
Cloud native focused supply chain

158
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,940
compromises but just general open source

159
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,120
supply chain compromises

160
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,840
we are also very interested in

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,180
um uh also pulling in additional data

162
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,680
from other researchers as well on that

163
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,919
and before I show off the software

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,139
supply chain security best practices if

165
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,240
folks are interested the link is in that

166
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,900
QR code

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,160
there and I'll leave it up for for a

168
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,840
minute but just while we kind of go

169
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,759
through that I'll talk a little bit

170
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,259
about

171
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,780
um uh software supply chain uh the the

172
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,120
security best practices here but I'll

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
give that a minute

174
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,900
um

175
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,600
all right and let me just move on to the

176
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
next slide just to kind of

177
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,800
show this right here it

178
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,199
so um so what is the supply chain

179
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,000
software supply chain security best

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,819
practices guide it is a um you know it's

181
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,979
a set of best practices for uh the

182
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,840
supply chain security it spans the

183
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,180
entire sdlc and I'll show that off in a

184
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,300
second

185
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,759
um it is both a set of specific best

186
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,860
practices that often can be turned into

187
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,360
stuff like controls as well as just sort

188
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,160
of General guidance around how to

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
approach certain things

190
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,300
uh interestingly enough it's actually

191
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,880
been cited in the nist's secure software

192
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,620
development framework so some of the

193
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,819
stuff that uh you know the government

194
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,620
has said hey here's what we think we

195
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,960
should uh do is actually they cite um

196
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,900
this guide uh as a reference

197
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,300
and um just some examples here right

198
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
like some of it is this is stuff like uh

199
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,139
you know requiring sign commits

200
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,759
two-person code review those sorts of

201
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,020
things

202
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,900
but I will switch over to the guide here

203
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,940
real quickly

204
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,000
oh sorry that's the

205
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,900
sorry my tabs all got messed up here

206
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,940
ah there we go

207
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,280
so um so this is like the supply chain

208
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,319
uh this is just an example of what we've

209
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,139
worked on here in

210
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,020
um the the uh

211
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,780
the software security working group

212
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,219
sorry software supply chain security

213
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,559
working group and so this is an example

214
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,159
uh this came out I believe it was 2021

215
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,958
um and I contributed a little bit to it

216
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,458
which is

217
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,299
um

218
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,320
the the uh it is a set of best practices

219
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,060
it includes a bunch of information about

220
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,300
like what is supply chain security

221
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,640
um you know uh what you know it's mostly

222
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,800
focused at a broader level

223
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,420
um this was you know before a lot of the

224
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,600
tools have come out uh today but it

225
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,040
talks a lot about like you know stuff

226
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,019
like shared responsibility

227
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,000
um it talks about stuff like you know

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
how to secure software I'm sorry how to

229
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,140
secure your source code and how your

230
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,820
source code you know a compromise to

231
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,200
your source code could potentially lead

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,260
to larger impacts down the way

233
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,420
um it followed by then you know how to

234
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,519
secure the build itself and what are the

235
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,160
impacts of a of a um

236
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,459
of an insecure build and

237
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,700
um you know things like you know

238
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,459
using Branch protection rules and and

239
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,959
all these different things to sort of

240
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,360
make sure that you're securing both your

241
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,000
software or sorry securing your software

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,339
dependencies securing your source code

243
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,500
securing

244
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,260
um all the things throughout the sdlc

245
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,300
until production

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,399
I won't go too deep into it you're more

247
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,860
than welcome to sort of uh read this and

248
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,180
then if folks have questions afterward

249
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm more than welcome to uh more than

250
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,339
welcome to to ask them

251
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,160
all right

252
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,620
so the software supply chain security

253
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,980
best practices after that was released

254
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,480
there was a desire by the group to then

255
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,980
say okay what can we do to start

256
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,019
building an architecture around this to

257
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,180
start to say hey what sort of things can

258
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,339
we then do from those best practices and

259
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:18,600
then turn it into something that's

260
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
actually an architecture and that's

261
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,220
where the secure software Factory came

262
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,560
into play and that's something that I

263
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
co-led with a few other folks like

264
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,500
Andres Vega from control plane and uh

265
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,720
the link to that is also up there in the

266
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,040
QR code

267
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,019
and I'll leave that up for for a minute

268
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,380
or two

269
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,080
and so just as an ex you know uh to

270
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,000
provide some you know background

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
the secure software Factory rate like

272
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,899
you had these best practices what do we

273
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,700
actually do about it

274
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,540
and so you know we can what's what's

275
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,980
kind of that critical piece and the

276
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,540
critical piece here is is that build

277
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,820
um because when you think about a lot of

278
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,160
things like dependencies and source code

279
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,500
and and the artifacts that you

280
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,760
eventually run into production well

281
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,220
what's the kind of what's that key

282
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,079
funnel and the key funnel here is the

283
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,820
build pipeline itself it's where you're

284
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,899
taking

285
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,820
source code is where you're taking

286
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,620
dependencies is where you're taking all

287
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,240
this external stuff that's often

288
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,940
unprivileged you're then compiling it

289
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,820
building it running tests Etc and then

290
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,680
packaging it all up and you're trying to

291
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,180
turn it into something that's privileged

292
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,480
to then run in um an environment like

293
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,300
production right or being distributed to

294
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,100
customers

295
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,660
and so

296
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,060
the approach we took with this was you

297
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,560
know we feel like there's three core

298
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,040
tenants to sort of securing the build

299
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,019
first is you want to secure the pipeline

300
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,760
itself you want to make sure that only

301
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,100
approved things are allowed to run and

302
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,040
in fact certain things must be run so as

303
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,680
an example if you are you need to

304
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,360
generate an s-bomb you need to run a

305
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,519
security scan if you're a Dev you should

306
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,040
not be allowed to disable that right so

307
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,320
that's one key piece and so that's kind

308
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,079
of securing orchestration but then what

309
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,060
about the actual workloads that are

310
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,680
running especially in a cloud native

311
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
context right you know in a cloud native

312
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
context one of the problems is well it

313
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,519
doesn't matter what I'm running an admin

314
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,040
to the kubernetes cluster can just

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,260
swap out a container image in a pod

316
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,660
right well that's where you know stuff

317
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,480
like workload identity comes into play

318
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,579
and where you want to actually secure

319
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,100
the workload from being tampered with

320
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,140
and so that's stuff like spiffy Spire

321
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,320
from implementation standpoint

322
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,519
and then

323
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,959
you actually want to secure obviously

324
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,700
what the workload itself is actually

325
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,860
doing so if you have a build I don't

326
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,540
know you're running go build or whatever

327
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,420
you want to make sure that you know

328
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,060
using stuff like ebpf or other sorts of

329
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,800
introspection techniques you want to

330
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,360
make sure that the build itself is not

331
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,740
doing something nefarious it's not

332
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,360
trying to reach out to the internet and

333
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,220
download something from malware.com or

334
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,440
whatever right

335
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,180
um and so another thing also is that you

336
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,760
know as part of the collaboration right

337
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,560
there's a demonstrative implementation

338
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,420
of this secure software Factory that's

339
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,440
maintained by the openssf called Fresca

340
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,019
and I will show a little bit more of

341
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,079
what the secure software Factory uh

342
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,680
looks like here

343
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,660
so I'll just you know see if I can find

344
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,519
a good diagram

345
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,220
here let's just kind of just sort of

346
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,220
show off uh here we go I know it's maybe

347
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,440
not the easiest thing to read here so

348
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,279
let me

349
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,260
try and

350
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,940
but here's an example of what that

351
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,680
secure software Factory looks like

352
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
here's some diagrams it's about I don't

353
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,200
know yeah it's about like 20 Pages uh

354
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,100
worth of write up diagrams and so on

355
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,660
um

356
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,760
and uh yeah there's a bunch of stuff in

357
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,740
here about how you know approaches to

358
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,139
take to sort of you know secure the

359
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,420
build on how to sign things you know

360
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,360
using things like Sig store and so on

361
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,100
and if folks have questions about this

362
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,160
also at the end uh feel free to to bring

363
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,260
it up

364
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,920
all right

365
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,839
so those are the two main pieces of uh

366
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,700
big sort of

367
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,600
um

368
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,880
uh

369
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,260
deliverables over the past few years

370
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,240
from uh the supply chain security

371
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,980
working group

372
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,500
and so what are we currently uh doing

373
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,079
right so one of the big ones

374
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,079
um is uh supply chain security tool

375
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,100
mappings

376
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,860
so um that's something that uh one of

377
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,139
the one of our core contributors Marina

378
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,899
Moore is is working on and just kind of

379
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,720
to show a little bit of that is

380
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
um we have this is just a spreadsheet

381
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,100
but you know the idea here is we're

382
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,839
looking to sort of look at those supply

383
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,000
chain security best practices stuff

384
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,560
that's referenced in the secure software

385
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,820
Factory

386
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,459
and be able to sort of map those

387
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,199
controls and map those best practices

388
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,839
and and various other requirements into

389
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,360
what tools in generally in the space do

390
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,220
we see kind of hitting those things and

391
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,019
we're definitely you know anybody who's

392
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,240
a contributor we'd love to kind of see

393
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,680
you know if you think your tool kind of

394
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,899
hits these things yeah like please come

395
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,120
and uh tell us about your tool

396
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,500
um you know obviously as long as it's

397
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,060
open source

398
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,100
and we'd love to have that included and

399
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,420
we'd love to kind of you know know more

400
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,339
more about this you know know more about

401
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,620
what what folks are working on

402
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,980
so that's uh one key piece another key

403
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,220
piece is which is just starting now in

404
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,160
um uh John John from VMware uh is

405
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,860
working on this is the uh real world

406
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,779
supply chain uh uh security policy which

407
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,760
is um the goal of this is going to be

408
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,399
trying to kind of build out like a

409
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,839
couple like white papers and those sorts

410
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,760
of things around hey how will people

411
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,100
actually you know how do people actually

412
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,560
approach supply chain security at an

413
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,360
organization and what sorts of things

414
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,040
are they worried about and how do they

415
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,420
take those best practices and understand

416
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,459
those best practices and things like the

417
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,260
secure software Factory and understand

418
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,940
how do they prioritize different

419
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,800
elements of it and what are the things

420
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,180
that should be important to them and

421
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,260
what are the things that they should be

422
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,000
concerned about

423
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,180
foreign

424
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,699
okay and then um what do we plan to do

425
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,680
right so there's a bunch of stuff that

426
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,660
we want to do in the future

427
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,079
um but two of the big ones are we want

428
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,820
to build a supply chain security

429
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,920
Improvement program for the scenes for

430
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,920
cncf projects themselves

431
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,800
um and those uh that's where you know we

432
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,339
actually want to go out and build out uh

433
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,620
like almost like a journey for for cncf

434
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,199
projects to kind of say Hey you know

435
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,000
similar to how you have incubation you

436
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,779
have

437
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:01,560
um

438
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,779
you you have uh you can keep dating

439
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,280
projects you have projects that have

440
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,260
passed Security review and so on we want

441
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,780
to have a set of requirements for cncf

442
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,520
projects as well because as you can

443
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,559
imagine right like if a lot of folks are

444
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,160
relying on kubernetes and if kubernetes

445
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,959
supply chain is broken then your

446
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,520
supplyness change is broken if you rely

447
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,099
on kubernetes so that's kind of one of

448
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,959
the things that we're looking to do and

449
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,640
we know that like a lot of projects

450
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,620
already like kubernetes are you know

451
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,360
implementing things like salsa they're

452
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,679
implementing a lot of the supply chain

453
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,540
security best practices but we want to

454
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,580
extend that across

455
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,100
um the cncf projects right because there

456
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,679
are a lot of you know as you might be

457
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,200
um if you take a look right like there's

458
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,380
a lot of tools in the cncf that are

459
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,900
security tools and we want to make sure

460
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,340
that those security tools themselves

461
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,940
have a secure supply chain

462
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,620
and then in addition to that we want to

463
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,539
partner with more groups across the

464
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,220
Linux foundation and across the broader

465
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,320
community on some of these sorts of

466
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,900
initiatives right and and many of the

467
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,140
members who are you know Volunteers in

468
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,080
um uh in tax Securities supply chain

469
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,840
security working group also contribute

470
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,539
to open ssf contribute to the CD

471
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,340
Foundation

472
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,000
um

473
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,340
as well as many other sort of Open

474
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,620
Source groups uh like you know there's

475
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,539
folks we have folks who contribute to

476
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,700
oasp who contribute to us and vice versa

477
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,460
and so we are very interested in kind of

478
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,080
continuing to to collaborate there

479
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,080
and then how can you get involved right

480
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,900
um well uh we meet every Thursday at 11

481
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,020
A.M Eastern uh you know you can find the

482
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,380
invite on the normal cncf calendar

483
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,140
uh the meeting is open to everyone who

484
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,059
follows the code of conduct and also

485

um all of our meetings are recorded and

487
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
they end up on YouTube uh afterwards so

488
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,620
if also folks who are interested who

489
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,059
just want to understand like hey what

490
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,440
what sorts of things we're working on

491
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,240
you could go to the cncf uh YouTube

492
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,980
channel and just kind of look through

493
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,600
and you can see some of our recorded

494
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,799
meetings

495
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,600
and then if you just kind of interested

496
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,460
in other things just sort of on the

497
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,320
day-to-day what sorts of things are

498
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,960
going on in the cncf uh security uh

499
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,580
sorry in the cncf supply chain security

500
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,980
working group you should take a look at

501
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,740
the tag security issues and there's a

502
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,960
bunch of different things in there

503
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,919
um

504
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,860
yeah and so that's kind of uh

505
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,720
it for the main piece and then I'm just

506
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
going to kind of just go through a few

507
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,020
things here

508
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,940
um and I know sorry to pick on Marina

509
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,740
that I had just actually talked about

510
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,960
your your your mapping spreadsheet just

511
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,820
as right before you walked in

512
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,559
um so yeah there's the the there is a

513
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,960
tools mapping um spreadsheet that we you

514
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,419
know once again that uh working on and

515
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,340
that if folks are interested

516
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,000
um

517
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,120
you know Marina's is is leading that up

518
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,559
and then

519
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,600
um you know for folks who are interested

520
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,000
in controls right there is the tag uh

521
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,559
there's there's the controls working

522
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,840
group which sort of built out a

523
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
spreadsheet

524
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,559
um for controls and then uh somewhere

525
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,539
down here at the bottom I believe and

526
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,960
let me see if I can increase the size

527
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
these are like you know

528
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,500
um supply chain security best practices

529
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,580
Rewritten as controls and also there are

530
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,860
some mappings to you know what what sort

531
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,020
of nist requirement do they potentially

532
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,120
map to not everyone does map directly to

533
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,980
a nist requirement but there's some

534
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,299
stuff there

535
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,559
and

536
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,400
um

537
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,200
and there is potentially some work there

538
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,940
just so you know to sort of maybe map

539
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,760
integrate that with oscal if folks are

540
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,760
um interested in oscow which is and if

541
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
you're not interested in oscow you're or

542
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
you're not familiar oscow is just a a

543
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,120
potentially a way to it's an open

544
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,080
um

545
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,179
security controls assessment language I

546
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,620
think it's something like that anyway

547
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,260
the the basic idea is is a way to sort

548
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,660
of take stuff like security controls and

549
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,640
security control assessments and codify

550
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,120
it into a structured language like Json

551
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,120
XML Etc and then be able to say great

552
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,440
you know now you can just sort of

553
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,500
automate control assessments and and so

554
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,340
on and so that's kind of tied in here

555
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,620
um there is a lot of collaboration with

556
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,580
uh salsa which is an open ssf standard

557
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,200
um you know there's a lot of folks who

558
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,240
you know myself included who contribute

559
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
to salsa as well as this and there's a

560
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,720
lot of

561
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,280
um sort of collaboration back and forth

562
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,500
around stuff like definitions so

563
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,440
definitions in salsa site stuff in cntf

564
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,120
and stuff that cncf is doing is is

565
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,340
looking back at stuff that that salsa is

566
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,539
doing

567
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,840
to to help out there as well

568
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,799
um

569
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,860
yeah and then just for folks who are

570
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,659
interested if you if you look at the

571
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,780
nist ssdf you know some of the controls

572
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,760
uh are not I don't think they call them

573
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,900
controls I think yeah they call them

574
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,880
practices and tasks but some of the

575
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,860
practices and tasks actually cite the

576
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,539
cncf

577
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,780
um secure supply chain uh best practices

578
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,080
here as well

579
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,260
um

580
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,340
yeah I believe that is it uh yeah that's

581
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,039
all I all I have for now and if folks

582
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,659
have questions

583
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,580
um or you know want to know more and

584
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,340
whatever feel free to to ask

585
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,620
foreign

586
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,780
let's see

587
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,600
um just as a having contributed to a

588
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,980
bunch of these things I just have links

589
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,179
to them

590
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,400
um I can add them into the the slides

591
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,419
and make sure that the slides are

592
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,900
instead

593
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,500
oh yeah yeah they are in the GitHub

594
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,000
issues but sometimes that's not the

595
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,220
easiest to

596
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,659
oh the

597
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,020
um tag security issues so if I go back

598
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,539
to here

599
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,820
um I believe

600
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,340
so for example for Marina's thing there

601
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,500
is a cncf supply chain security tool

602
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,600
mappings one

603
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,059
which cites that and then

604
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,039
oh it looks like yeah there is a

605
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,039
controls catalog

606
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,000
uh

607
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,400
the organization could be a bit better

608
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,559
but

609
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,700
um yeah

610
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,299
but there is a uh some stuff here in

611
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,960
oops

612
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,440

all right cool well yeah if there's a

617
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,220

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,919
chain security working group

622
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,539
um or any of the other sort of projects

623
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,700

624
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,500
to work on or some of the things that

625
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,480
we're doing with the openssf like salsa

626
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,860
and Fresca and all that good stuff

627
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,679
foreign
