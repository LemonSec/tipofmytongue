1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,940
I'm here to talk a little bit more about

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,920
how do we get those kinds of

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,120
Integrations going for not just GitHub

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,420
but for your Enterprise and for you know

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,639
open source software in general

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,440
um for those of you who aren't familiar

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,480
with Cloud events we'll be talking about

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,680
that in a moment but first we're going

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,660
to talk

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,859
using some of the terminology from cloud

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,920
events what is an event so they Define

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,699
an event to be a notification of

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,340
something having been observed so it's

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,180
not

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,239
a PR was opened you know the pr being

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,160
opened happens whether or not you listen

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,140
for the event but the event is sort of

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,480
telling you hey if you were interested

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,100
you could go and listen to this stream

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,719
of stuff and you could find out all the

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,340
PRS that are being opened in this repo

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,079
or something like that

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,980
um so the great thing about this is that

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,600
there's a lot of different systems that

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,360
produce events the other awesome thing

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,100
is that everybody has made up their own

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,300
formats

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,399
um

29
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,080
that's not really awesome because it

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,159
means if you want to interact with

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,720
GitHub and you want to interact with

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,520
gitlab and you want to interact with

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,780
bitbucket and you want to understand

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,840
pull requests

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,979
you need to write three copies of the

36
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,200
same code and as much fun as it is to

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,240
write three copies of the same code

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,460
I've done it enough

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,920
um so Cloud events is a cncf project to

40
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
standardize

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,220
a simple envelope kind of think of it

42
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,860
like HTTP for events you know you walk

43
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,259
up to a whole bunch of apis all over the

44
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,580
world they got different bodies

45
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,759
different payloads but those headers are

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,920
common you got common libraries for like

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
assembling a URL and things like that

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,079
and Cloud events aims to do that and

49
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,360
lets you convert things between all the

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,500
formats that are already out there in

51
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,579
the world it's not going to replace

52
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,340
stuff like protocol buffers or Json or

53
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,159
Avro but you can take a record that was

54
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,200
written in Avro and mechanically convert

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,899
it to Json and put it on a different

56
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,939
type of messaging system for example or

57
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,280
write it to a log or something like that

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,280
and there are a bunch of systems already

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,500
um I linked some at the bottom some are

60
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,020
cncf projects some are other projects

61
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,540
um that produce these kinds of events

62
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,520
that you might use to react to security

63
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,099
issues

64
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,000
um

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,220
but it's not just about reacting you can

66
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,780
also take advantage of these to be

67
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,700
proactive and say hey

68
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,220
you know there's a software build I need

69
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,739
to initiate a security scan or you know

70
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,840
hey

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,900
I scanned this two weeks ago should I

72
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,239
rescan it you know I know it was built

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,860
two weeks ago I should you know

74
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,440
re-initiate scans on this thing with a

75
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,800
newer set of vulnerabilities

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
and you can also use this you saw Falco

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,220
on the previous page you can use this to

78
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,080
discover hey wait there were unexpected

79
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,120
system calls from this container

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,940
um and I'm not going to run through the

81
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,519
demo here but Falco did a great series

82
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,280
of blog posts with eight different

83
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,300
systems that you could integrate through

84
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,140
through Cloud events with Falco sidekick

85
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,560
to basically answer solve the problem

86
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,900
there's a pod running in my cluster it

87
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,700
just started a terminal that's connected

88
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,360
to a uh or a a shell that's connected to

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,340
an interactive terminal I would like to

90
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
delete that pod

91
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,300
you know so your attacker comes in pops

92
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,720
open a shell and delete pod

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,760
find a different way in open a shelf

94
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,959
delete pod

95
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,360
and so you could actually go and play

96
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,860
with this you know with Cube control

97
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,620
exec or you know build yourself a little

98
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,140
web shell run it and watch it get shut

99
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,379
down

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,940
um so these are some examples of actual

101
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,819
events the one on the right is the Falco

102
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,900
rule

103
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,180
um the one on the left is from CD events

104
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,340
about a deployment you can imagine how

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,860
both of these are interesting and useful

106
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,360
when you're trying to build a picture of

107
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,879
your security posture or to react and

108
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,140
mitigate things that are happening in

109
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,879
your Enterprise

110
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,519
I've had to cut down on the content of

111
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,720
the payload in both of these cases

112
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,159
they're actually longer than this but I

113
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,519
thought you might want to read them

114
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,060
so

115
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,799
this is where I get to my call to action

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,319
if you're a vendor who's producing these

117
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,540
things

118
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,858
generate Cloud events tell people what's

119
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,478
going on

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,339
um document what those Cloud events look

121
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,280
like so that people can build these yes

122
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,360
they're going to be Rube Goldberg

123
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,580
machines but Rube Goldberg machines are

124
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,800
how a lot of Our Lives get done

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,160
so don't fear them

126
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,220
don't go wild but don't fear them

127
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,000
um

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,460
and if you're an end user there's a lot

129
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,720
of different places where you can do you

130
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,520
can react immediately I'm sure a lot of

131
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,500
people have seen the Lambda that goes in

132
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,020
and fixes I am if you make an oopsie or

133
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,000
something like that you can store these

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,320
in bigquery or snowflake or something

135
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,000
like that and query over them later hey

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,600
you know I wanted to know this incident

137
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,160
happened what else was happening around

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,740
that time and you can also keep them as

139
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,139
audit records long term in something

140
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,660
that's really cheap and again if there's

141
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,060
a problem you can pull them out later

142
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,139
and since they're in a standard format

143
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,460
you can stack up a whole bunch of these

144
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,340
things and then filter them later

145
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,900
um if they were all different formats

146
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,160
you need to know oh this one's Avro and

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
this one's protobuf and this one's Json

148
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,940
uh I don't really think you'd enjoy

149
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,040
writing that parser later

150
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,300
but if you know you can take them all

151
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,280
stick them all in Avro and you know

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,660
record them off into S3 or something

153
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,340
like that then

154
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,780
um

155
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,240
life is pretty good so

156
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,280
um little pitch for those of you who

157
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,139
haven't seen Cloud events it's a short

158
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,180
spec it's like I don't know 10 pages

159
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,440
something like that you can read it real

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,620
fast

161
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,580
and I don't know who's next but

162
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,729
[Applause]
