1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
hello and welcome

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,600
to our talk learn by hacking

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,300
we're infinitely grateful that our RX or

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,920
the cloud native invite Enlightenment

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,040
and we extend a heartfelt thank you to

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,340
you the attendees volunteers

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,420
contributors and the cloud native

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,340
Computing Foundation involved in the

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,400
vision and delivery of kubernetes

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,920
documentation and Bug fixes do not write

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,380
themselves and the incredible selfless

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,019
contributions that drive open source

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,098
communities

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,800
have never been freely given or

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,420
gracefully received

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,280
security controls are generally more

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,300
difficult

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,640
to get right in complex orchestrations

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,160
with the functionality that kubernetes

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,540
is known for

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,879
to these security teams especially we

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,980
thank you for your hard work the tax

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,920
security ctfs are a reflection of the

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,899
pioneering Voyage of the good trip of

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,039
kubernetes

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,140
out in the choppy and dangerous free

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,039
Seas of the internet

28
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,199
we have a free book available to

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,140
download written by myself and my

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,640
veritable co-author Mr Michael

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,200
hasenblast

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,140
there may be useful tips and tricks for

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,900
individuals looking to assail the cloud

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,060
native infrastructure if you're

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,400
intrigued enough by this talk to join us

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,080
on Thursday and play our new scenarios

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,119
so we're going to talk about how we run

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,159
ctfs at Cloud native security con over

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,240
the past years

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
what we did what we did what do we hope

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,159
to achieve for you the attendees and we

42
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,799
how we maintained our fragile sanity

43
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,740
while provisioning thousands of notes on

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,880
demand per day

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,579
over the years we have run ctfs in

46
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,640
person virtually planning for these

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,399
events began in the Ethereal and Misty

48
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,000
Nights of 2019 as we looked to determine

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,880
what it would take to put together a CTF

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,600
running on kubernetes for kubernetes

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
without having the entire infrastructure

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
come crumbling down around us

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,120
nothing is more terrifying than building

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,780
a self-hosted security game and inviting

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,739
all and Sundry to have a blast at it

56
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,680
our goals are to communicate how best to

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,260
secure Cloud native infrastructure

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,540
they are red team scenarios with full

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,120
demonstrations teardowns and

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,160
remediations

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
the best form as Sun Tzu has told us of

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,879
defense is attack know thyself and we

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,379
look to give something back to the

64
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,480
community that has so generously shared

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,459
so much with us

66
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,000
here stands the nefarious pirate Captain

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
hash Jack

68
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,560
leading the charge with his eponymous

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,260
bag of Bitcoin

70
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,260
and the entitled Goose that sparked so

71
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,739
much security enthusiasm across the last

72
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,379
few years

73
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,360
this is a learning experience for all

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,220
skill levels starting with an

75
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,560
introductory scenario at either each

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
event building up in difficulty

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,420
progressing as a game that gets more and

78
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,640
more difficult throughout the journey to

79
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,800
Captivate and Intrigue all skill levels

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,780
and help nurture and seat the interest

81
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,760
in and around security

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
with dedicated infrastructure we look to

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,420
emulate as much of the real world

84
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,239
systems at some cost of complexity that

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,739
we're going to dwell slightly further

86
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,200
into the presentation the goal is not to

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
find the Ultimate Security ninja but the

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,659
right Rising tide that will lift all

89
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,640
boats and that players have fast

90
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,319
feedback and support to enhance their

91
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,099
learning experience

92
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
but first here is a digital

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,659
reconstruction by the street artist

94
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,040
Banksy

95
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
of what a bunch of pirates would look

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,159
like playing a cloud native CTF

97
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,319
with a splash of stable diffusion for

98
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,720
effect as well

99
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,560
so there is no such thing as secure

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,319
software as fast as we can possibly

101
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,840
paint over the colorful selection of

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,760
vulnerabilities in our infrastructure

103
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,238
new features are shipped software moves

104
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,620
quickly

105
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,779
and those new features potentially

106
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,100
feature untested code paths

107
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,680
and any of those on tested code paths

108
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,660
with security side effects are by

109
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,360
default vulnerabilities we prioritize

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,300
shipping features over vexing

111
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,900
vulnerabilities at our Peril of course

112
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,100
and this is the reality of modern

113
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,560
software that we balance in our

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,820
day-to-day every day

115
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,919
resemblance to the friction we see

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,620
between red teams and blue teams

117
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,960
any any resemblance in that last

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,900
animation is not a coincidence

119
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,419
organizations not only evolve for

120
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,820
competitive Advantage they must do so in

121
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,380
order to survive because their

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,720
adversaries are also evolving

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,759
so how do we represent that complex

124
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,460
puzzle in a safe learning environment

125
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,919
as scenario authors we look to construct

126
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,600
the most realistic s scenarios that we

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,580
can manage that includes building

128
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,320
infrastructure diagrams and thread

129
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,020
modeling scenarios and help us develop

130
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,360
with greatest degree of realism and is

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,220
born from our experience Consulting with

132
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,860
regulated Industries and startups alike

133
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,960
here we can see a supply chain attack in

134
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
progress Captain hash Jack has a tax

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,120
systems through various Network systems

136
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,460
in the past including packing

137
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,280
repositories container Registries and

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,500
the notable hypertext coffee pod control

139
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,240
protocol

140
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,520
with no stone left and hindered running

141
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,259
the platform on real infrastructure

142
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,419
gives us the opportunity to emulate

143
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,960
simulations we see in real life coffee

144
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,800
pots and iot pots and coffee pots and

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
iot attacks are not the exception

146
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,580
and we are looking to educate as many

147
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,940
people as possible as effectively as we

148
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,660
can here we see a pod security treasure

149
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,380
map from the book hacking kubernetes

150
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,759
these scenarios are intentionally

151
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,460
increasingly complex and difficult

152
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,199
this helps to crystallize players

153
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,840
understanding of a wide and complex

154
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,460
security landscape and as with all ctfs

155
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,520
attendees and players must enumerate

156
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,380
the visible Horizon

157
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,020
escalate that privilege reverse back

158
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,300
from dead ends and intentional

159
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,160
misdirections

160
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,039
this pod treasure map details many of

161
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,840
the routes that an attacker might

162
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,080
explore within a kubernetes cluster

163
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,900
but with each scenario there is only one

164
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,860
intentional route for a player to find

165
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,600
with the notes and caveats the players

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,660
have found multiple bypasses unintended

167
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,560
shortcuts and Wily workarounds as Noble

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
routes to completion

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,280
so how's the CTF played with a terminal

170
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,740
IP address an optional authentication

171
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,199
credentials for an SSH session a

172
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,539
kubernetes cluster or other mystery

173
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,280
piece of infrastructure

174
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,199
here we see the first view of a cluster

175
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,300
that a player has when placing a root

176
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,120
enabled container running in cluster

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,419
they must enumerate the visible uncover

178
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,460
the invisible and start to explore

179
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,919
potential routes of compromise in the

180
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:35,940
cluster

181
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,400
this may include hijacking sessions and

182
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,460
credentials attacking apis and data

183
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,380
stores routable from the starting point

184
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,139
and escalating privilege through any a

185
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,720
null identity mechanisms a cloud native

186
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
system may have

187
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,259
my personal preference is to bring a

188
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,900
portable set of bass scripts to speed up

189
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,120
enumeration and exploitation

190
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,639
however there are no rules what tooling

191
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,740
you can bring with you you just need to

192
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,380
find somewhere to execute it from

193
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,500
over the years we have looked at a whole

194
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,479
host of vulnerabilities and

195
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,419
misconfigurations from container image

196
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,840
file system foobars and runaway runtimes

197
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,660
to secure config malicious mounts

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,479

203
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,820
chronic control plane configurations and

204
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,179
unlimited user exposures and there's

205
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,200
more from Ingress to the kernel

206
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
we played this remotely we're playing it

207
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,220
in person this time around

208
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,899
adapting to the pandemic and running

209
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,779
from virtual events online Gatherings

210
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,660
running the infrastructure over Slack

211
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,720
peace was never an option

212
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,120
so how did we go about this high

213
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,080
pressure live deployment of 2 500 nodes

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,320
across each day we play the game we

215
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,240
start with the open source breach

216
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,820
simulator tool built to help control

217
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,760
planes clients secure their clouds

218
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,940
one five node cluster is provisioned for

219
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,680
each scenario

220
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,160
and plus the ReUse is not enabled

221
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,500
we add a double dose of supermassive

222
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,019
provisioning engines backed by k-native

223
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,540
scaling to zero these are not

224
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,360
centralized in a unified engine

225
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,279
this sits on the back of a pub sub queue

226
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
and re-enterence state machine which

227
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,779
tries to ensure that even half

228
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,300
provisioned clusters are forced into

229
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,920
life

230
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,920
and reinvigorated when half deployed

231
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,620
which just means distributed systems as

232
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,540
we know are hard

233
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,640
then the unique credentials are

234
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,440
distributed to each player for each

235
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,140
scenario cluster pairing and the games

236
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,260
begin our trusty task Masters are on

237
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,680
hand in person and on slack to hand out

238
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,459
hints offer suggestions and guide people

239
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,820
through the path of the challenges

240
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,680
all this adds up

241
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,140
we spin up the Clusters as needed and we

242
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,300
hit the lofty Heights of two and a half

243
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,779
thousand nodes spun up per day with 80

244
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,320
to 100 participants we hope to beat this

245
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,820
record on Thursday

246
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,519
what has gone wrong

247
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,440
would you really believe us if we set

248
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,640
nothing

249
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,600
there was one time an AWS internal

250
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,720
Ubuntu mirror went down as you can

251
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,820
imagine nothing completed provisioning

252
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,180
simulator was just host dead in the

253
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,200
water

254
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,600
hell checks decidedly unhealthy to

255
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,459
Showcase that

256
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,800
typical distributed system problems when

257
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,500
ec2 wouldn't provision VMS a very red

258
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,860
dashboard a rising sense of panic came

259
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,779
from it that required us reprovisioning

260
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,180
into a different region post haste

261
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,100
that time somebody figured out how to

262
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,440
bypass the initial SSH tunnel sandboxing

263
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,600
which was also interesting securely

264
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,700
provisioning and secure infrastructure

265
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,779
is hard

266
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,940
we don't want it too insecure

267
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,640
when the cluster admin R backs

268
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,579
the rbac credentials disappeared gone

269
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,100
found their way and through Bastion node

270
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,140
when the test Suite only covered the

271
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,220
happy paths also

272
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,920
and through it all we seem to have hit

273
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,620
our goal we're thankful to everybody who

274
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,839
has played the game given us feedback

275
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,940
and give us the opportunity

276
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,180
to iterate on this wonderful thoroughly

277
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,459
enjoyable platform that we love to play

278
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,760
ctfs can often be big

279
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,380
can feel daunting

280
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,800
so we hope that you focus on The

281
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,079
Learning Experience walk through the

282
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,380
scenarios and if you feel like smashing

283
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,420
machines channel that please

284
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,000
[Music]

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,600
and uh clusters and scenarios today are

286
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,480
of course open source running on this

287
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,019
Cloud native breach simulation

288
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,040
underneath the kubernetes simulator

289
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,500
project there is a hosted version and

290
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,600
control plane are running a private beta

291
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,140
if you would like to be involved

292
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,660
as you can see nothing is perfect

293
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,399
there's an out of bounds exception on

294
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,320
the end of the slide if you would like

295
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,660
to pop some shells with us please come

296
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,620
and play tomorrow

297
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,590
