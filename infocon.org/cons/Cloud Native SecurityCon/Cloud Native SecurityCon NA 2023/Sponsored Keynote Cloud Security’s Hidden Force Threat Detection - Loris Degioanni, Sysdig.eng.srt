1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,700
good morning

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,060
we are living in interesting times I

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,880
mean think about that just 15 even 10

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,120
years ago we would have imagined that

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,580
a large part of the world software would

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,340
be running in containers we would be all

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,240
using sophisticated cicd pipelines that

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,660
our software would be uh

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,500
organize the microservices and schedule

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,679
by software like kubernetes or other

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,860
orchestrators that deploying our

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,079
software in the cloud would be the rule

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,480
and not the exception

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,840
so definitely interesting times but we

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,059
are at a security conference and from

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,379
the security point of view if you think

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,399
about that the challenges that we are

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,700
required to deal with to solve are

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,600
largely the same uh fix find and fix

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,480
vulnerabilities in our software manage

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,579
configuration and permissions this is

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,459
particularly critical when our software

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,080
is deployed in the cloud and essentially

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,180
everybody has remote access to our

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,820
infrastructures mid compliance which is

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,100
a moving Target

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,740
every country every every continent is

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,900
constantly changing rules from this

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,299
point of view and of course detect and

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,700
respond to threads so when we look at

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,960
the security landscape from the

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,659
perspective of cloud native we can see

33
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,820
two Trends the first one is towards

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,900
shift left right and this is driven by

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,659
The increased huge usage of cicd

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,700
security by the fact that we are

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,920
centralizing our artifact our software

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
the dependencies in repositories where

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,619
we can then validate and check for

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,540
vulnerabilities better

41
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,500
the second trend is a trend toward the

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
right right toward runtime security and

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,180
this one is driven by the increasing

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,759
complexity by the orchestration by the

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,520
fact that uh you know microservice based

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,140
infrastructures that Iranian kubernetes

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,840
are maybe easier to operate but it's

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,940
hard to actually figure out what's

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,920
happening at runtime and when we think

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,780
about these two Trends the one toward

51
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,099
the left and the one toward the right

52
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,200
typically in the context of quantity

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,140
security we tend to think about the one

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,599
toward the left first right it's natural

55
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,020
it fits very well the model it's also

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,300
easier if you want I shouldn't say

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,280
easier in the context of security but

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,040
you know what I mean

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,620
I'm here to argue a little bit for the

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,239
shift to the right and the fact that

61
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,239
it's equally important in particular you

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,239
know runtime security is key to detect

63
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,140
attacks blocks your day

64
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,680
events prevent drift

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
and many other things I like the squad

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,280
from the cloud security podcast

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,760
detection and response is all about

68
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,260
solving the security problems that the

69
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,060
rest of the security organization has

70
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,680
been unable to solve

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,860
you can have a fantastic supply chain

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,780
security you can have great

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,060
vulnerability management but in the end

74
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,099
the Box stops

75
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,140
where your applications are running in

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
your production environment so without

77
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,340
great visibility without uh granular

78
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,019
ability to see what's happening

79
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,420
you have a gap you have a big gap

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,640
fortunately the cognitive computer

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,720
Foundation is a tool that can help you

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,300
with this its name is Falco I'm one of

83
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,420
the Falco contributors and I like to

84
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,159
describe Falco as the security camera

85
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,500
for your Cloud native infrastructure

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,459
Falco is traditionally based on ebpf

87
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,799
instrumentation and can see what every

88
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,580
single process does in each of your

89
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,640
containers and hosts but in time the

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,420
community has extended it to support for

91
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,000
example Cloud logs so you're able to

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,420
tell when one of your users

93
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,099
logs in your AWS environment without

94
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,360
multi-factor authentication or

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
we embedded it in GitHub so you're able

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,839
to tell when somebody commits in one of

97
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,180
your repositories a password or a secret

98
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,800
or something like that

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,120
uh

100
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,699
in general Falco is a great community

101
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,740
that can help you you know get started

102
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,100
and also solve Advanced problems that

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,380
you might have with the tool as I was

104
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,720
saying before typically

105
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,419
you know shift left is what we worry

106
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,500
first and that's totally natural but I

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,440
argue that

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,460
understanding what's happening at

109
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,580
runtime is not only equally important

110
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,580
but highly complementary and a key

111
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,520
component of a truly uh well-designed

112
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,979
security strategy for cloud native so

113
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,820
think about it today and go take a look

114
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,199
at Falco

115
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,570
thank you very much

116
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,490
[Applause]
