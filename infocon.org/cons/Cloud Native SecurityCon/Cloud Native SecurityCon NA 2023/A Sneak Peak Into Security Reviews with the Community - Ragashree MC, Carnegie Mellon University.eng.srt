1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,340
we wrote a book we wrote a book about

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,740
all the security assessment activities

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,140
we are doing what are the things that is

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,240
covered in these activities and how you

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,040
can get some goodness

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,040
so let's dive into it I mean What a

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,379
Wonderful World today isn't it at least

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,600
for the last two days I've heard and

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,060
listened and been part of so many

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,160
activities and it's so overwhelming

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,680
everything is connected and this

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,480
Innovation everywhere

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
I think it's the best time to be here

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,220
around and be here in Silicon Valley

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,920
that that's so awesome this is not

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,140
Silicon Valley I understand San Jose and

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,940
San Francisco and these times are but I

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,559
just came from India so please bear with

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,540
me

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,540
but in the same context there are also a

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,460
lot of things connected and the attack

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,460
surface is increasing more than ever and

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,719
that means

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,559
if anything is in fact indeed

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,140
kinda compromised then all of us are in

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,020
soap and lock 4J for that matter was a

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,239
really good example to show that if

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,979
everything is connected and if

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,619
everything is in fact the way it is we

30
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,360
need to be really careful about what we

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,460
are doing in the first place and it is

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,920
important to understand how secure are

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,240
we really are

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,100
and

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,740
memes kind of like this kind of make me

36
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,979
scared most of the time and it says that

37
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,720
if any project is not looking into

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,700
Security in the first place and they

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,280
just build and look into their features

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,140
and ship something and then see oh my

41
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,080
God how did we get hacked that kind of

42
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,140
makes me really really weird and scared

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,140
for the rest of my life so that's one of

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,939
the reasons why I joined tax security

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,640
because you're not alone in this process

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,920
there is a lot of help available for you

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,200
there is a lot of help in terms of what

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,899
you should be doing and how you can

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,119
actually do them in terms of tools and

50
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,340
mappings and guidelines and everything

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,979
and that has also help to see if you've

52
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,960
done it the right way

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,299
we also have a particular team of

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,979
volunteers to actually help you go

55
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,780
through the security assessment in terms

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,880
of self-assessment joint reviews and

57
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,340
things like that and shout out to one of

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,440
my colleagues and volunteers here

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,319
is giving a talk in about 45 minutes so

60
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,420
please feel free to go to that talk and

61
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,860
see all the goodness that we are

62
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,440
providing as part of tax security

63
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,260
but then we also thought how can we

64
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,940
actually supplement all these goodness

65
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,000
how can we help you verify what you did

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,520
was in fact right and how can we help

67
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
you verify at the earliest what you did

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
or what you're going to do is indeed

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,099
right

70
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,020
and that's where we want to introduce

71
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,720
you to security assessments book

72
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,540
security assessment book is intended for

73
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,640
project maintainers and security

74
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,280
enthusiasts security reviewers who want

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
to join us in this process understand

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
what is going in the background and we

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
want to make sure we really lower the

78
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,940
barrier for entry so all of us are in

79
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,860
this together if you want to perform

80
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,680
some Security review for your project or

81
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,780
if you want to join hands with us and

82
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,400
join hands in this activity of

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
Assessments it's really clear what is

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,060
happening in the background and we can

85
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,940
all be together in this and improve the

86
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,700
security posture of our landscape and

87
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,560
the benefit really is to understand the

88
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,720
security assessment process and the

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,599
benefit that you get as part of making

90
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,599
the software itself more secure and it

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,700
started as part of

92
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,739
um like Andy said it started as part of

93
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,540
a part of lightweight threat modeling

94
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,659
because we had the very good process but

95
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,060
there were certain experts who knew what

96
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,340
the need to be done and if I wanted to

97
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,280
join I'm a student right now I did a bit

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,620
of my engineering and Enterprise

99
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,659
experiences before but I'm a student

100
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,879
right now if I want to join how do I

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,260
really get started

102
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,080
who tells me what I need to do and that

103
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,599
was not very transparent before and that

104
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,340
was primary reason why we started this

105
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,379
project so all of us get a clear

106
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,780
visibility of what is happening and what

107
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,180
needs to be done and kudos to our

108
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,280
primary author Justin kappos he couldn't

109
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,040
be here with us today but he is wishing

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,900
us the best from China so thank you

111
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,459
Justin

112
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,900
and we want to make this a community

113
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,120
resource we're looking for feedback from

114
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,760
all of you in terms of what you need and

115
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,380
if we are addressing everything you need

116
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,000
and if there is any scope for

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
improvement do feel free to reach out to

118
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
us

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,759
now let's dwell into what all the

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,040
goodness is all about so I'll be talking

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,800
about the security assessment how it is

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,199
different from audit how to perform one

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,000
such thing and if you don't want to

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,979
perform yourself we have volunteers who

125
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,900
do that for you how to get one security

126
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,720
assessment for yourself and what's next

127
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,840
in terms of this project

128
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,940
so security assessment is about

129
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,280
examining the architecture and the

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,139
posture of your project

131
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,139
it's it's to give a holistic view on

132
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,820
what are the things that you are doing

133
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,580
and is it actually aligning with the

134
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,500
goals of security in terms of your

135
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,080
project it Dives deep into the systemic

136
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,300
and the design related issues not

137
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,820
necessarily the implementation and

138
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,500
provided your architecture doesn't

139
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,080
change drastically it does stay for a

140
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
longer time

141
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,180
it sounds more similar to audits right

142
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,660
but then audit has fewer Minor Details

143
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,580
that is what makes it different from

144
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,500
assessment so audit really looks into

145
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,360
the implementation issues it doesn't

146
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,419
really it does but not specifically

147
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,220
meant to look into a systemic or design

148
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,639
related issues and audit provides you a

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,220
snapshot of your security posture at

150
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,320
that point in time with the addition of

151
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
Minor Details and new lines of code that

152
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,820
posture may change as the project

153
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,340
progresses but security assessments on

154
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,380
the other hand it's meant to be valid

155
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,479
for a longer Direction until you really

156
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,000
change your architecture or revamp your

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,460
project as a whole

158
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,860
now how to actually perform a security

159
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,259
assessment to do that you need to know

160
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,180
what you're protecting you need to know

161
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,880
what your assets are you need an assets

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,440
are something that brings value to you

163
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,080
and you have control to do something now

164
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,780
say for example I want to create a

165
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,479
website I host it in some cloud provider

166
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,960
I use DNS I use routing Services I use

167
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,479
my ISP to actually route my traffic to

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,860
the web server

169
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,680
in this something that is of value to me

170
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,020
and which I have in my control to

171
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,940
actually do something about it is my web

172
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,639
server and my web application other than

173
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,580
that I can change a few things but not

174
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,680
necessarily dwell deep into how they are

175
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,600
implemented and make changes over there

176
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,139
so understanding what are assets are and

177
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,300
how they interact with each other

178
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,639
is something really important and assets

179
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,560
need not be just intangible ones it can

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,300
be tangible ones as well so

181
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,100
differentiating what is that that is

182
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,900
important for us and how they interact

183
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,000
with each other in terms of data flow

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,460
diagrams among many others that becomes

185
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,919
very important

186
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,100
once you know you what your assets are

187
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,600
understanding who the actors are that is

188
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
associated with the asset is another

189
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,220
secondary Factor so there are actors who

190
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,860
increase the security posture of your

191
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,020
asset and there are actors who try to

192
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,120
decrease your security posture and then

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,220
there are also actors who supplement it

194
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,740
based on their activities it can enhance

195
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,199
or it can decrease so understanding who

196
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,180
these actors are is kind of very

197
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,740
important

198
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,960
now once you know your asset once you

199
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,460
know the actors you need to also

200
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,139
understand what are the goals for your

201
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,720
system is it confidentiality is it

202
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,460
Integrity do you want it to be available

203
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,680
all the time what exactly is the goal

204
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
for your system now for example

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,819
governments may be very careful and they

206
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,740
may be very conscious about protecting

207
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,479
their information and making it very

208
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,180
confidential on the other hand Facebook

209
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,000
and Google and availability may be very

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,220
important for them because even one hour

211
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,900
of downtime or even one minute of

212
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,699
downtime will bring a loss of huge

213
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,440
amount of revenue for them

214
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,840
and these the CIA Triad is considered

215
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
the holy Triad but it's not necessarily

216
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,580
enough there is also other secondary

217
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,979
factors such as authentication

218
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:15,780
non-repudiation secrecy privacy and

219
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,180
other factors that may also be important

220
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,400
for you understanding what these goals

221
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,340
are is very essential and with this

222
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,680
goals we will be able to map what are

223
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
the things that is in threat and how we

224
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,680
can actually mitigate it

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,320
on the other hand the attackers are very

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
very interested in bringing down all our

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,580
goals so they may be interested in

228
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,339
disclosing our sensitive information

229
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:43,200
altering our assets and making hampering

230
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
our integrity and distracting our

231
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,580
services and bringing down the

232
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,680
availability so understanding what the

233
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
attacker goal may be and what is that

234
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,120
your primary concern will help you in

235
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,760
mitigating all the risks

236
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,800
you know from the assets assessment

237
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,019
perspective itself there are three

238
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,060
primary goals in terms of assessment you

239
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,860
need to identify what your threats and

240
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,779
risks are and then you need to

241
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,899
categorize based on the impact and then

242
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,940
respond based on what is that is most

243
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,040
important for you

244
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,140
from the identification perspective if

245
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,760
you've been in the previous talk you've

246
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,399
heard in lens and depths about this

247
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,160
thing there is several modules that is

248
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,720
available and methodologies and

249
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,399
Frameworks that's available for you in

250
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,519
terms of what actually is in threat for

251
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,160
uh the service or the application so

252
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,640
basically in terms of identification we

253
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,980
we need to know what are the threats

254
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,500
that is possible for the service and to

255
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,180
know that we already went through the

256
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,640
actors and uh assets that is important

257
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
for us and among the various Frameworks

258
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,440
Andy talked about stride but there are

259
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,899
also other things like pasta tried and

260
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,360
octave and Linden that is newly

261
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,180
available for privacy So based on uh

262
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,040
what approach your organization is

263
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
taking is it a risk-based approach is it

264
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,019
attacker-centric is it developer Centric

265
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,480
you can choose the relevant model for

266
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
your identification and then work upon

267
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
the threads accordingly

268
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,800
so now in the cloud native Community we

269
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,260
are mostly developer Centric and we are

270
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,200
very focused on our community and stride

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,480
is one such developer-centric model that

272
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,899
helps us identify the threats and help

273
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,540
in the mitigation steps so we in this

274
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,459
book we talked more about stride

275
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,160
framework so stride basically stands for

276
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,380
uh it's an abbreviation for spoofing

277
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,240
tampering repudiation information

278
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,940
disclosure denial of service and

279
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,860
elevation of privilege

280
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,860
when we want to discover any threats

281
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,660
that is applicable in our environment it

282
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,519
can be fitting into one of these buckets

283
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,180
so if there is no TLS no encryption then

284
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,320
it is hampering our information

285
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,600
disclosure and it's actually Bringing

286
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,279
Down the confidentiality

287
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,380
and things like that so this is how we

288
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,480
can identify what really matters for us

289
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,579
and how threats are impacting our

290
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,079
product

291
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,180
now once we know what are the threats

292
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,399
that is applicable here we need to know

293
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,019
what is the damage that is caused

294
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,959
because we do not have forever we cannot

295
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
boil the whole ocean we cannot address

296
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,940
every little thing that comes upon us we

297
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,980
need to be able to find what is that is

298
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,380
most craziest for us or what is that is

299
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,240
most easiest for us because for some

300
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,540
threads Stars need to align and some

301
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,459
crazy four five ten zero day

302
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,079
vulnerabilities has to come up for some

303
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,060
threats to be realized but for others

304
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,360
it's clearly visible if there's HTTP

305
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,980
like some web application is running on

306
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,560
HTTP that's clearly a threat for us so

307
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,180
those are the those are the ways in

308
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,300
which we can identify the impact and the

309
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,640
likelihood and then find out what the

310
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,800
damage that is cost for our service and

311
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
mitigate it accordingly and there are

312
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,339
popular Frameworks like a common

313
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,040
vulnerability scoring system and Dread

314
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,899
from Microsoft that is available for us

315
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,360
to see what is the impact and categorize

316
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,420
based on that and address accordingly

317
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,420
now once the rest impact of the threat

318
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,000
is known next step is to go for how we

319
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,279
respond for those threats now we know

320
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,500
there are high severity medium severity

321
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,860
or low severity threats

322
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,079
and how we respond to those threats is

323
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,720
very important in terms of if there is a

324
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,820
possibility to prevent something let's

325
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
prevent it let's not put some patch and

326
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,480
just make it something like a immediate

327
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,279
thing let's think about the long term

328
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,899
and if there is a preventative measure

329
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,120
let's do that but if there is no

330
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,220
preventative measure that's available at

331
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,620
least let's recover from it if there

332
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,720
does happen some damage let's recover

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,300
from that damage if that's also not

334
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,339
possible let's detect that some damage

335
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,040
has happened and Trace the whole source

336
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,880
of it

337
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,100
if there's no traceability at least

338
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,540
let's detect it

339
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,820
but otherwise at least let's do some

340
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,860
traceability so this is how the

341
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,800
prioritization works so we prevent it if

342
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,440
not possible let's recover and if that's

343
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,120
also not possible let's at least detect

344
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,139
with some traceability

345
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,240
so we did supplement we wrote a big book

346
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
about it to verify if what you did is

347
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,880
right or how we can verify at the

348
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,160
earliest what you're doing is right

349
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,339
now this is already a process in tax

350
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,339
security we we have a big process for

351
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,560
all the projects that is going from

352
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,540
sandbox to incubation or entering

353
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,399
sandbox or you want to go to graduation

354
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,579
so what we recommend is First Step as

355
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,920
performing the self-assessment so there

356
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,720
is a lot of material that is available

357
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,360
in our repository you can go ahead and

358
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,100
perform the self-assessment as per the

359
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,260
template that is shared and present the

360
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,019
details in one of our tag meetings so

361
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,240
tag technical Advisory Group for

362
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,180
security we meet every Wednesday and you

363
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,100
can present it in any of our meetings

364
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,899
and it's a community of security

365
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,700
Engineers we are more than happy to

366
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,519
review and share our feedback and once

367
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,260
you have completed the self-assessment

368
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,180
and given the presentation

369
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,339
tag will include it in our repository

370
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,040
and you can just create a PR and include

371
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,540
the self-assessment and be more than

372
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,000
happy to include it in our repo and once

373
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,740
that is done this is usually recommended

374
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,540
for projects that are entering as

375
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,120
sandbox stores and

376
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,220
a bit lower in the maturity in the tag

377
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,200
graduation process

378
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,839
and the next one is the joint assessment

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,639
that is recommended for somebody who's

380
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,680
going from sandbox to incubation or

381
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,380
incubation to a greater maturity of

382
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,800
graduation and in that uh the volunteers

383
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,440
from our attack sit together with you

384
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,199
understand the whole process of what

385
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,240
exactly your application is doing and

386
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,980
where the threats are coming from and

387
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,720
what is the impact of each of these

388
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,699
threads and how you can mitigate it to

389
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,680
enhance your graduation level

390
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,040
or maturity level so uh to get one such

391
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,899
assessment you can initiate a joint

392
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,360
review request you can add an issue in

393
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,040
our tag repository all of the links are

394
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,839
given here and the slides will be shared

395
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,420
so you can issue one of one such issue

396
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,320
in our repository and we as reviewers we

397
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,180
sit together and see if there is a

398
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,920
conflict of interest and we declare that

399
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,139
conflict of interest and see get

400
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,300
together who are not having any such

401
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,000
conflicts and then we sit together with

402
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,300
the project teams and understand

403
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,899
your project scope and what are the

404
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,699
threats that is applicable and we

405
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,920
clarified all the review process

406
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,860
together and and some cases we also

407
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,260
perform the Hands-On reviews and finally

408
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,019
the system discussed with you and

409
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,000
finally it will be presented in one of

410
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,279
our tag meetings and uh the assessment

411
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,279
will be added to our repo

412
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,380
and I really need to mention a couple of

413
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,180
names here these are the folks who have

414
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,459
done awesome work in tax security

415
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,920
assessment Justin capos Matthew Kisa

416
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,660
Andrew Martin and other Tech

417
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,180
contributors who have really spent a lot

418
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,360
of time in helping increase our posture

419
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,220
and as a community so that's really

420
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,779
awesome

421
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,399
now what's next

422
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,540
it

423
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,120
you know there's a book now I literally

424
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,120
walked like I talked too much now so how

425
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,779
how how can you get involved so if you

426
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,699
have any feedback go through go through

427
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,560
the book first if you have any feedback

428
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
anything that is missing anything that

429
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,220
could be done differently or any major

430
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,380
things please feel free to let us know

431
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,120
we are more than happy to inculcate the

432
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,699
feedback and for folks who have already

433
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,740
gone through this process if you have

434
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,079
any commentary expert commentaries or

435
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,579
feedback you want to include in that

436
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,620
book please feel free to reach out to us

437
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,839
we chat in the tax security assessment

438
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,100
slack channel in the cncf workspace and

439
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,019
we have come together a teeny bit of

440
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,560
guidelines for engagement so that we

441
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,940
accelerate this process and not stick

442
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,100
together with small nitty gritties so we

443
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,779
try to focus as much on the high level

444
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,120
problems and omissions and we welcome

445
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,279
any expert commentaries and feedbacks

446
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,319
from the community and to maintain the

447
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,299
uniformity and single voice in the book

448
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,220
some of the modifications may be

449
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,439
paraphrased by our primary author so

450
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,720
these are some of the requests for you

451
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,280
in terms of guidelines for engagement

452
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,439
but other than that feel free to reach

453
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,020
out to us for any form of feedback and

454
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,720
with this I end any questions

455
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
thank you
