1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,480
uh hi my name is Neil Naveen and I'm

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,880
excited to be here today

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,799
here's a little bit about me

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm currently 14 years old and I'm a

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,059
middle schooler

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,820
um I've been coding for seven years two

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,260
of them in golang

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,539
uh in my free time I've been avidly

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,020
solving leak code problems 500 of them

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,760
in addition to my passion for

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,859
programming I've written and published

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,140
two books on Amazon

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,599
outside of academics I've been

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,880
practicing Jiu Jitsu for four years and

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,079
I've competed multiple times

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,640
I started coding when I was eight on a

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,200
site called code combat

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,660
here I created AI combatants to fight

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,339
other Bots created by other people

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,940
uh

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,640
when I turned 11 I was ranked 16th out

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
of around 50 000 players on a

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,100
multiplayer Arena hosted by code combat

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,079
when I turned 12 I moved on to

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,640
leapco.com

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,300
here I hone my algorithmic coding skills

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,580
when I turned 13 I went back to bot

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,500
programming this time on a site called

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,880
coding game

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
here the competition was much more

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,020
Fierce which meant I had to use better

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,299
algorithms some of which I'd learned

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,520
from leak code

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
for example when I was creating an

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,780
ultimate tic-tac-toe AI I had to use

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,240
algorithms like Minimax and Monte Carlo

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,759
search search tree to make my code fast

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,560
and efficient

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,140
in this time I also start to notice my

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,060
dad contributing to open source

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,820
cly or GH CLI is a tool used to interact

42
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,100
with the GitHub API directly from the

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,079
command line without ever having to go

44
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,299
to GitHub itself which I thought was

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,259
cool

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,659
I learned about this when one day I saw

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,880
my dad doing something strange

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,340
whenever he would be creating a PR he

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,439
would always have to go to github.com to

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,540
finalize it but today he was doing

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,520
everything from the command line

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,280
I asked him how he was doing this and he

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,619
said he was using a tool called clay

54
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,500
I furthermore inquired what was Clay and

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,538
he showed me how cly allowed him to

56
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,760
interact with the GitHub API directly

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,800
from the command line without him ever

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,739
having to go to gitup itself

59
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,620
another day I saw him reviewing PR's all

60
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,120
from the same person

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
I asked him who created all those PRS

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,739
and he said it was not a person creating

63
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,500
those PRS but a bot like one of my bots

64
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,819
encoding game

65
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,560
but instead of fighting on Ultimate

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,599
tic-tac-toe board it had to fight

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,180
vulnerabilities in your dependencies

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,280
dependabot is a tool used to interact

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,640
with the GitHub API I mean is it a tool

70
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,000
that creates fixes whenever any of your

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,379
dependencies have updates so your

72
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,480
project is always up to date

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,580
on a later date I thought about those

74
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,459
two things depend about in Collide and I

75
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,099
wondered did Clay have depend about

76
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,319
turned out it did not so I created a

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,360
fixed ad depend about to cly and it got

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,000
merged I was excited

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,099
Clyde's important project because many

80
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,319
contributors use it so securing it was

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,540
key

82
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,300
I hope I've opened a window for young

83
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,099
folk like me into the world of Open

84
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,280
Source age is not a barrier to entry

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,019

87
