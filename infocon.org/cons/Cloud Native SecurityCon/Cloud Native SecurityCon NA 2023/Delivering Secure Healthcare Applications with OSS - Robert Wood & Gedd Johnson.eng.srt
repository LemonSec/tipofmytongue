1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,360
good morning everyone almost lunch time

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,520
um and I just want to say thank you for

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,379
taking the time to come here today we're

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,480
going to be talking about this platform

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,460
as a service abstraction known

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,320
affectionately as Batcave and we're

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,299
going to be talking about how it is used

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,420
in one of the largest Federal Healthcare

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,800
organizations one of the largest federal

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,920
agencies but specifically we are focused

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,920
on delivering Health Care oriented

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,160
applications and and how we're doing uh

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,779
our software security supply chain

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,420
security things like that through this

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,380
particular approach so for introduction

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,660
sake I'm Rob wood I'm the Chief

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,180
Information Security Officer and hey

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,040
everyone Jed Johnson I'm a tech lead

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,260
with the defense unicorns and a platform

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,600
engineer on the Batcave project awesome

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,600
and so CMS for anyone who is not

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,460
familiar with it it is the centers for

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,860
Medicare and Medicaid services so

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,399
basically what we do is we manage the

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,760
back end the payment backbone for all

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,199
the payments that flow through the

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,240
Medicare and Medicaid systems along with

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,939
some other supporting programs like uh

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,420
chip which is a focused on childhood or

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,580
a child Insurance programs we do

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,220
clinical clinical standards for

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,439
hospitals across the U.S all like 6 000

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,479
or so of them and as well as a bunch of

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,380
other things and so all in all our

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,960
programs cover over 130 million people

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,259
across the U.S which is a pretty decent

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,500
amount of Phi pii just sensitive stuff

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,299
that we have to make sure we are

39
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,079
protecting so

40
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,140
as you might imagine doing that at scale

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,479
inside the federal context comes with

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,659
challenges there are challenges from uh

43
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,640
the federal compliance standpoints

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,880
you've got fedramp you've got atos

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,119
you've got lots of bureaucracy uh you

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,860
know it's it's almost uh it's almost a

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,659
meme or I'm sure people have meme that

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,240
uh all of the

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,979
all of the red tape that you're kind of

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,780
swimming through to do anything in a

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,880
large Enterprise let alone the largest

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,340
Enterprise in at least the country

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,040
potentially the world that is the U.S

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
federal government and so you know we

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,000
have a lot of developers thousands of

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,980
developers all working across different

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,720
parts of the organization it's Federated

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,959
it's disconnected Loosely coupled

59
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,220
different missions different priorities

60
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,560
all of that stuff and there's a lot of

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,780
uh a lot of waterfall development still

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,819
happening there's a lot of agile

63
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,260
Transformations which is really just

64
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,300
translated to uh more affectionately

65
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,840
like agile fall because

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,220
you're kind of just delivering in

67
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,319
Sprints or you're tracking a waterfall

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,120
project in jira and you kind of wrap it

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
up and call it devops and and you know

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,900
you kind of move on and that's not what

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,760
we're aiming to do we're aiming to

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,220
actually enable faster more efficient

73
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,180
more secure software development so

74
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,879
our solution or part of our solution to

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,660
this problem is the bat cave which uh

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,040
because every good government program

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,080
needs an acronym it is the continuous

78
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
authorization and verification engine we

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,739
just needed something that mapped to

80
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,780
something fun and exciting for Branding

81
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,280
purposes so that's what we came up with

82
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,580
and so this is really CMS has one of the

83
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,120
largest cloud footprints in the world

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,360
um mostly on AWS I'm on Azure and so

85
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,500
there is

86
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,959
there is a very large Cloud footprint

87
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,700
that we're already working with and the

88
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,920
Batcave is really an opinionated

89
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
abstraction on top of the CMS Cloud

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,200
program that's Tech that's process

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
that's onboarding that's people that's

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,620
policy all of that but it's an

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,599
opinionated abstraction trying to

94
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,000
alleviate some of the the double work

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,299
and uh and leg work and prep work for

96
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,459
compliance and authorization processes

97
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,560
that people have to go through in order

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,739
to get something done and built on like

99
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,140
inside of the the Enterprise

100
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,879
um and so some of our goals

101
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,459
uh we have many but we want to we want

102
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,739
to help people move faster naturally we

103
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,599
want to help people do it more securely

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,940
naturally we want to make sure that

105
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,040
things are compliant because we have uh

106
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,140
office of inspectors General to reckon

107
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,540
with and Audits and and all of this

108
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,040
stuff that we have to deal with that's

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
all important in the federal context but

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,899
really at the end of the day if I could

111
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,400
draw your eyes to the bottom right of

112
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,740
this slide is about empowering and

113
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,860
enabling continuous delivery like true

114
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,880
continuous delivery in the federal

115
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,880
context not we want to deliver something

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
so we're going to pause and wait a month

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,060
and do a security impact assessment and

118
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,680
make sure we do a controls like a mini

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
audit that's not continuous delivery

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,900
like you need to make a change because

121
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,699
log4j just came out you know like the

122
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,380
log for Shell issue just got released

123
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,940
and you need to

124
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,940
change your application right now we

125
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,979
want to be able to do that without the

126
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,440
bureaucracy getting in the way so Tech

127
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,960
supported and process supported

128
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,320
so I want you to kind of rewind yourself

129
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,880
in time back to like March 2020. so

130
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,800
we're all sitting around maybe we're in

131
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
an office maybe you're you know you're

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,699
out at the mall you're out at a bar and

133
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,740
covid-19 is just starting to kind of

134
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,500
float around the world that's coming to

135
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,560
the US it's there's like 10 to 20 cases

136
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,460
and then the White House issues a decree

137
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,139
Nationwide shutdowns Nationwide

138
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,820
shutdowns everything is going into

139
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,880
lockdown mode so businesses stop

140
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,400
businesses stop bringing people in all

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,259
of that stuff happened really really

142
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,660
fast worldwide especially in the US and

143
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,180
so now imagine you're inside of a

144
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,580
federal agency and you want to like you

145
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,560
have a responsibility an imperative to

146
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,020
start contributing to the problem to the

147
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,660
solution in some meaningful way so you

148
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,000
go through and you do your ideas you

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,759
start generating things and

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,860
in the federal contact at least in CMS

151
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,199
we are heavily supported by contract

152
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,880
partners

153
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,340
and so to get to a contract partner you

154
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,020
can't just you can't just sign up with a

155
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,699
credit card you actually have to prepare

156
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,500
a proposal like a procurement package

157
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,259
put it out uh people have to submit bids

158
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,580
to it all of it like that is a whole

159
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,860
long process in and of itself uh another

160
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,259
thing that has been heavily uh glorified

161
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,120
over memes the the slow Federal

162
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,460
procurement process so call six months a

163
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,500
pretty aggressive timeline because these

164
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
are extraordinary circumstances and you

165
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,300
kind of keep evolving

166
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
um you kind of keep evolving now let's

167
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,080
say you've awarded your contract you're

168
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,840
starting to do uh design work and

169
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,220
onboarding people and background

170
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,020
checking and the contractors then hiring

171
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,220
the folks that are going to staff the

172
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,199
project and you're starting to really

173
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,780
like this idea is really starting to

174
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,780
come together and so you know from there

175
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,220
you're starting to like set up the

176
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,600
infrastructure you need you start to

177
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,580
make some some design decisions around

178
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,979
what you're doing and then rewind all

179
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,560
the way into the future and you've got

180
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
your thing built and now you have to go

181
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,240
through a three to six month ATO process

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,639
which is also like that's that's

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,660
somewhat quick in some agencies and

184
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,699
what I want to really try to drive home

185
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,139
here if I could do this without falling

186
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,460
off the stages is uh look how much these

187
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,039
the problem space has changed from when

188
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,539
you were over here and you started

189
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,460
coming up with your ideas for how you

190
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,199
were going to fix the problem the

191
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,240
assumptions that you made

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
then and the assumptions that you now

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,940
have when you're when your app is live

194
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,680
are radically different we're talking

195
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,539
Millions upon millions of people

196
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,479
affected or potentially facing like

197
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,319
lethal outcomes because of one

198
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,259
one strain of a virus in covid-19 and

199
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,660
this is like one Healthcare

200
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,000
emergency sort of situation that

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,340
agencies like CMS are contributing to

202
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,139
there's the opioid epidemic there's

203
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,300
there's uh you know these more bespoke

204
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,860
diseases that are starting to have like

205
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,440
outbreaks again and and this is the kind

206
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,240
of thing that federal agencies need to

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,580
be able to responsively and nimbly

208
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,400
respond to situations so let's say we

209
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,960
get all the way to the end of that and

210
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,699
we need to start making changes quickly

211
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,620
in the in the order of magnitude of

212
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,900
hours and days not weeks to months to

213
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,880
quarters we need to be able to do that

214
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,500
and do so in a way that doesn't throw

215
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
the baby out of the bathwater of all the

216
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,460
compliance security resiliency

217
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,160
requirements that are necessary in

218
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,539
operating in the business of the

219
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,000
government that is like we can't forego

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,160
that because real people you know it's

221
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,840
not like you're going to lose your you

222
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,339
know your cat videos or your you know

223
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,779
your food logs or whatever like you're

224
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,339
gonna like we're in the business of the

225
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,899
government so we have very real things

226
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,240
to reckon with and contend with and you

227
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,580
know like presidents come and Congress

228
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,559
comes and they you know there's hell to

229
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,020
pay if you don't do something that you

230
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,880
were asked to do from those upper

231
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,600
echelons of government so this is our

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
flywheel and I'm not going to walk in

233
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,660
detail through all of this but you'll

234
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,640
see terms on here like marketing and

235
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,800
sales and customer enablement and value

236
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,200
and all of that and we are really

237
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,540
thinking about the ecosystem that is CMS

238
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,000
hundreds of fisma systems which are

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,740
composed of different web services and

240
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,360
applications and database you know like

241
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,420
data tools all of that

242
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,279
we're thinking about this from a total

243
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,140
addressable Market space really trying

244
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,640
to lean in and instead of bring the

245
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
hammer down like most cyber security

246
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,360
organizations do and say

247
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,360
thou must adopt this platform because

248
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,920
there's people are just going to ignore

249
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,140
us that is inevitable like that's

250
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,880
typically how it goes in security when

251
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,339
security teams start going in not

252
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,800
empathizing with who their stakeholder

253
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,660
or customers a customer is on the other

254
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,899
side and just making demands you might

255
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,120
get short-term compliance but long term

256
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,740
people are going to hate you resent you

257
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,420
ignore you and so you're not going to

258
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,980
really move the needle and so we're

259
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,899
really leaning in on this concept and

260
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,940
this is more like this is part of a

261
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,980
broader culture shift inside of CMS

262
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,720
inside of our cyber security

263
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,360
organization that is focused on

264
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,339
empathy over the person on the other

265
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,560
side of the of the conversation the

266
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
developer enablement the person who's

267
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
struggling to just get something done

268
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,779
because the app that we provided them

269
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,100
sucks

270
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
um because it takes 20 seconds to load a

271
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,820
page because it's not accessible from

272
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,440
some Network segment you're in all of

273
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,560
that stuff like focusing on value

274
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,779
invest in value start to spread the word

275
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,279
like really trying to build something

276
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,440
that people find valuable and letting

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
that create virtuous Cycles is really

278
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,820
the kind of Cornerstone of our

279
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,740
particular flywheel so with that we're

280
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,480
going to transition into some of the

281
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,940
technical bits of how the Batcave

282
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,040
actually works so all right very good

283
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,959
hey everyone again my name is Jed

284
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,580
Johnson and I'll be talking about some

285
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,519
of the engineering implementation of the

286
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,339
Batcave platform so to begin with the

287
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,160
back a platform is built exclusively on

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,680
open source software and Partnerships

289
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,440
in particular we leverage an open source

290
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,240
product called Big Bang and this is

291
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,820
maintained by a United States Air Force

292
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,180
organization called Platform One and big

293
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,940
bang is the core Tech that the Batcave

294
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,279
is built off of and it's what has

295
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,339
allowed us to go from zero to prod in

296
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,040
less than six months and so big bang

297
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,180
itself

298
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,279
is a declarative Baseline of

299
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,860
configurations and applications used to

300
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,019
create a secure kubernetes based

301
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,440
platform so when we think about what all

302
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,600
is necessary to build a platform things

303
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
like logging and monitoring runtime

304
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,940
security pipeline tooling Etc Big Bang

305
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,300
provides secure hardened containers and

306
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,000
configurations for these core platform

307
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,339
components right out of the box

308
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,500
and additionally these hardened

309
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,959
containers and configurations they come

310
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,480
with oscout documents mapping their

311
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,300
implemented security controls to nist

312
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,560
853 so by adopting big bang and

313
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,320
organization can inherit a number of

314
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,300
these security controls and the goal is

315
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,200
to have in terms of nist 853 and 80

316
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,260
secure platform on day one of

317
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,120
development

318
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,459
at the same time while it's great to

319
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,560
have open source tooling like big bang

320
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,079
it's very rare that Open Source Products

321
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,360
will do exactly what you want them to do

322
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,000
right out of the box so here at Batcave

323
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,920
we have a contribute first culture

324
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,380
meaning that if an open source product

325
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,339
is lacking a feature or we find a bug we

326
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,500
will engage with that community and

327
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,000
oftentimes

328
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
we start the conversation by creating a

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,760
GitHub issue and in many cases the issue

330
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,800
that we create isn't on you know that

331
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,540
particular product's roadmap and so in

332
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,459
those cases we'll actually go in and

333
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,700
make the pr and fix the issue

334
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,639
also when using open source

335
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,680
there's always this option available to

336
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,380
create a fork of the product and while

337
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,720
there are cases when Forks are warranted

338
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,000
in our case it is an organizational

339
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,700
strategic imperative that we contribute

340
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,240
back Upstream so for example I mentioned

341
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,100
that big bang provides hardened

342
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,560
containers of Open Source Products so

343
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
let's say we want to use grafana to

344
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,480
visualize some metrics data

345
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,139
grafana the application receives

346
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,160
periodic updates from its developers

347
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,720
right like bug fixes and security

348
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,519
patches things like that

349
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,040
when these updates occur the Big Bang

350
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,480
team

351
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,360
brings them in creates a re-hardened

352
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,860
container a re-hardened version of

353
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,160
grafana updates its secure grafana Helm

354
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,380
chart and I take all of this as a

355
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,300
batcave developer and deploy it onto our

356
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,720
platform so as a result with with very

357
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,240
minimal effort on our part and using

358
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,399
this open source ecosystem

359
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,740
we get these bug fixes and we get these

360
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,200
security patches virtually for free just

361
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,540
by updating a single dependency and that

362
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,279
is big bang

363
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,100
if we were to create a fork of either

364
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,139
Big Bang or grafana this would

365
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,720
effectively double the work on our teams

366
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,300
in because now we would be the we would

367
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,279
be the ones monitoring that Upstream

368
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,380
grafana repo for updates and we would be

369
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,779
the ones maintaining this secure grafana

370
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,019
Helm chart so contributing to these

371
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,579
Upstream repos and building the

372
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,320
relationships in the open source

373
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,360
Community has been absolutely critical

374
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,300
to Batcave success

375
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,700
all right so now I'd like to introduce

376
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,740
the core Tech stack of the Batcave

377
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,540
platform that which we call the utility

378
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,839
belt and the utility belt is the set of

379
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,540
core services that run on every bat cave

380
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,639
cluster and this includes things like

381
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,500
our monitoring stack and logging stack

382
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,680
runtime security Etc and each one of the

383
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,139
apps that you see here contributes to

384
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,500
our platform's security control mapping

385
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,940
so first we Deploy on AWS eks and once

386
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,519
we have this bare eks cluster up and

387
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,440
running the first thing we do is install

388
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,380
flux and flux is our continuous delivery

389
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,139
tool for deploying the platform

390
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,079
we use flux to take all of these

391
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,920
CMS bat cave specific configurations we

392
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,959
overlay them onto a big bang Helm chart

393
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,660
and then deploy it all as a flux Helm

394
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,060
release and this single flux Helm

395
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,040
release will deploy the entirety of our

396
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,899
platform

397
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,000
so next the platform stack is deployed

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,040
in a particular order such that we

399
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,440
establish a security Baseline before

400
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,899
installing anything else in the cluster

401
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,120
so to do this the first thing we do is

402
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,339
install kyverno as our admissions

403
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,980
controller and kyverno allows us to

404
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,199
write policy as code that all of the

405
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,240
other resources in the cluster have to

406
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,860
adhere to

407
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,959
so then we install a service mesh using

408
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,300
istio this allows us to regulate all

409
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,459
Ingress egress and lateral Network

410
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,160
traffic and finally we install our

411
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,959
monitoring and Metric stack which is

412
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,360
Prometheus and grafana

413
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,060
once these apps have been installed to

414
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,160
establish that security Baseline the

415
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,959
rest of the platform the rest of the

416
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,339
apps and services you see up here

417
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,680
they're installed in parallel and again

418
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
all this is happening from a single flux

419
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,760
Helm release

420
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,100
and lastly once all of these core

421
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,740
services are deployed and healthy we use

422
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,380
Argo CD to deploy an app teams

423
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,500
application Argo CD will aggressively

424
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,260
reconcile drift so if someone attempts

425
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,019
to modify an application's configuration

426
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,480
once it's been deployed Argo will

427
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,220
automatically revert it back to the

428
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,800
state defined inversion control so in

429
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
other words we use Argo CD to deploy

430
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
tenant applications using this

431
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,740
declarative git Ops model

432
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,839
okay so at this point all of the

433
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,579
infrastructure and configuration this

434
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,320
code has been written it's all sitting

435
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,079
up in GitHub and the big question is

436
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,240
how do we want to deliver this platform

437
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,420
to the app teams and depending on what

438
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,279
app team you talk to you know people

439
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,139
want different things some application

440
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,300
teams already have platform engineers

441
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,579
and they feel comfortable managing an

442
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,740
AWS account and operating a kubernetes

443
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,740
cluster other app teams don't have any

444
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,119
platform engineers and they would rather

445
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,939
have a platform as a service fully

446
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,919
managed type of experience and of course

447
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,900
you also get every you know opinion and

448
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,119
use case in between those things so

449
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,880
after many iterations we ended up with

450
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,160
these three delivery models

451
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,040
the first and earliest model we have is

452
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,080
this single tenant platform as a service

453
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,140
and in this scenario each app team has

454
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,360
their own cluster that we the Batcave

455
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,460
team will manage and operate

456
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,440
and this model is really meant for app

457
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,620
teams who maybe have limited cloud or

458
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,140
platform expertise and also maybe they

459
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,660
have a higher budget and I mentioned the

460
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,120
budget piece because you can imagine

461
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,120
running your own eks cluster including

462
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,799
all those utility built apps you just

463
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,660
saw plus your own app like this can get

464
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,900
super expensive right that said if your

465
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,880
app is is truly Mission critical like

466
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
maybe it does warrant this single tenant

467
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,059
isolation model

468
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,400
that said like many app teams don't need

469
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,559
this level of isolation for example if

470
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,080
you're running a relatively low traffic

471
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,780
internal facing web app you probably

472
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,120
don't need an entire eks cluster to

473
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,840
yourself so in order to be a competitive

474
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,600
option for this other Market segment of

475
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,940
app teams we also have a multi-tenant

476
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,400
platform as a service model this model

477
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,340
Works especially well for entire

478
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,500
organizations that want to migrate their

479
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,600
entire Suite of applications to run in

480
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
the Batcave and of course the cost is

481
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,980
just going to be considerably less than

482
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,020
that single tenant option

483
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,820
technically speaking with this

484
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,980
multi-tenant model each app is separated

485
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,500
by namespace and each app has its own

486
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,299
dedicated node

487
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,820
by separating the apps by node this

488
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,160
allows us to mitigate the blast radius

489
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,500
in case one of the apps malfunctions so

490
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,140
for example if one of the apps has a

491
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,700
memory leak and it eats up all the

492
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,440
memory in one of the nodes and that node

493
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
becomes unhealthy and goes down the rest

494
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,039
of the apps running in the cluster

495
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,380
should be unaffected

496
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,020
and finally we meet some app teams who

497
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,880
already have platform Engineers who have

498
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,480
experience with AWS and kubernetes and

499
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,860
they express

500
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,620
and interest in Batcave to use our code

501
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,200
as a baseline for their own set of con

502
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,539
for their own set of security controls

503
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,720
and assessments for those teams we can

504
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,220
just give them an overview of the

505
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,620
Batcave platform Point them to our code

506
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,919
up in GitHub and let them dig in

507
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,740
now looking at these three models as one

508
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,780
of the engineers who has to implement

509
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,580
these different delivery models and then

510
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,140
operate all of these very different

511
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,419
clusters I can tell you firsthand like

512
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,179
this is too much right

513
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,460
having this many delivery models does

514
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,039
not scale very far past our current size

515
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,919
what we'd like to go in on is a fully

516
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,260
managed platform as a service model that

517
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,900
is multi-tenant and I I think sometimes

518
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,419
folks get hung up on this idea of

519
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,520
multi-tenancy and and for good reasons

520
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,740
but I think using that verbiage that

521
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,840
phrase like multi-tenant is actually a

522
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,120
bit of a marketing faux pas on our end

523
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,100
for example

524
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,160
when you deploy an app on Heroku or even

525
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,460
AWS do you know or even care if it's

526
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,980
multi or Singleton on the back end for

527
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,660
things like databases yeah sure you

528
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,640
might care but for the stateless

529
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,820
application itself probably not all you

530
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,860
care about is that your app is deployed

531
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,200
it's healthy and it's accessible

532
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,080
and that's the beauty of those platforms

533
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
the back end of the platform is

534
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,880
completely abstracted away from those

535
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,559
development teams and they can focus

536
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,380
solely on delivering value to their user

537
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,580
base

538
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,679
also from a platform engineering

539
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,660
perspective what we've discovered is

540
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,760
that whenever we onboard a new app team

541
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,580
it is so much easier to just spin up a

542
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,260
new node for them rather than an

543
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,200
entirely new eks cluster we can onboard

544
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,780
these teams so much faster and with way

545
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,379
less overhead

546
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,419
and lastly the the number one concern

547
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,880
that keeps coming up is this idea of

548
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,160
balancing developer Freedom versus

549
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,799
platform opinionation

550
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,900
more developer Freedom means more

551
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,880
options and more control for the

552
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,520
developers but this comes at the cost of

553
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,380
not being able to inherit security

554
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,900
controls from the platform and as a

555
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,640
result it's going to be more work on the

556
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,220
app team so in other words they pay for

557
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,980
this Freedom of Choice with their time

558
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,760
but with a highly opinionated platform

559
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,640
Rob can sign off on 80 or more of the

560
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,380
security controls as soon as an app

561
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,580
onboards

562
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,159
this enables us to give those app teams

563
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,140
the the flexibility and the control

564
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,179
where it matters most which we believe

565
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,159
is at the app tier

566
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,980
and that's the real value out of Batcave

567
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,620
we want to enable an app team to inherit

568
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,919
as many security controls as possible to

569
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,100
reduce this amount of redundant toil all

570
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,020
across CMS

571
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,400
all right with that I'll pass it back to

572
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,980
Rob to talk about what we've done so far

573
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,860
all right so

574
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,700
most recently we just re we just hit a

575
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,860
milestone around getting our full and

576
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,340
independent ATO the reason why that's

577
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,159
actually important is the way that

578
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,020
control inheritance ends up working in

579
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,159
the federal government is you kind of

580
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,960
you pick and choose things from these

581
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,940
packages these compliance

582
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,220
and if you have this this more General

583
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,900
broad

584
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,559
um

585
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,780
package where the Batcave is just a part

586
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,120
of it then the people on the other side

587
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,159
of that work the developers the

588
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,960
information security people who are

589
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,760
embedded in those teams still ended up

590
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,039
have to kind of go through and pick and

591
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,900
choose in the GRC tools like this

592
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,760
control applies that one is only

593
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,140
partially applicable this one doesn't

594
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,480
apply all of that stuff as opposed to

595
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,720
having this more modular approach and so

596
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,580
having our own full and independent ATO

597
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,500
is one of those examples of a back-end

598
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,280
process enabler for our teams

599
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,260
now right now we're heavily focused on

600
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,240
that production level multi-tenancy

601
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,919
model this is also something fairly new

602
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,640
for CMS most of the time segmentation

603
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,220
has sort of been a very rigid construct

604
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,600
we're going to segment you into

605
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,820
different AWS accounts

606
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,440
um you know your prod account your

607
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,419
staging account your test account and

608
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,900
your Dev account and um and that becomes

609
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,700
very very expensive over time especially

610
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,799
if resources are not optimized inside of

611
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,539
those accounts which oftentimes they're

612
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,840
not and so uh sort of Shifting where the

613
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,000
segmentation happens to the namespace

614
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,919
layer inside of a cluster and a node

615
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,679
that is just it's way more efficient way

616
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,780
more cost effective and so we're leaning

617
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,220
pretty heavily into that because we have

618
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,500
a lot of groupings of systems that are

619
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,460
fairly

620
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,799
on the same they're in the same sort of

621
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,960
bucket and category with regards to risk

622
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,360
and functionality and portfolio owner

623
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,220
like that the person who pays the budget

624
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,039
for that thing and so like this is

625
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,539
something that we're really uh really

626
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,880
trying to optimize for right now

627
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,400
um a couple other things that are in the

628
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,380
very near future slash being worked on

629
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,500
now integration with other stuff inside

630
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,720
of the office of impatient technology so

631
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,220
other components of the cloud program

632
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,760
writ large uh single sign-on onboarding

633
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,039
being able to generate design diagram or

634
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,659
architecture diagrams and that sort of

635
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,100
thing onboarding your logs and stuff

636
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,659
into Enterprise monitoring and

637
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,700
operations all of those other things

638
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,520
like the ATO gets a bad rap for being a

639
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,260
big Blocker in terms of getting stuff

640
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,640
out the door

641
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,980
but there's all sorts of other stuff

642
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,080
that happens either before or after the

643
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,500
ATO that also is a huge strain on

644
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,780
development teams and it's just not as

645
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,840
just not as gnarly or you can't say it

646
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,960
as easily as ATO and so

647
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,460
so we're really trying to make sure that

648
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,960
all of those other things those

649
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,659
orthogonal pieces are integrated through

650
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,940
this sort of middleware Enterprise API

651
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,860
that we're that we're building right now

652
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,960
and then the last thing which you'll see

653
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,960
on the top here is uh our security data

654
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,760
Lake integration so this is part of a

655
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,340
broader cyber security objective that we

656
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,020
have right now so

657
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,299
the show hands of folks who are familiar

658
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,740
with like Splunk deployments and stuff

659
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,100
like that all right so normally

660
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,539
uh my condolences uh normally the

661
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,640
the way you'd like deploy one of these

662
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,740
things is it's like it's anchored in

663
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,020
these little pockets of the owner of the

664
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,760
thing of the team that manages the

665
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,620
Splunk cluster now that's not a

666
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,000
limitation of Splunk that's a limitation

667
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,940
of how teams typically deploy these kind

668
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,039
of tools and so when when you start

669
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,140
introducing this like Network this like

670
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,020
Federated Network segment Dynamic and

671
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,480
and security versus operations and

672
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,100
ownership and all of that creates all of

673
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,559
these like silos and and that you

674
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,059
basically have to like reach across and

675
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,919
get approval to reach across to do

676
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,799
anything with that data and so taking

677
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,240
from

678
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,000
taking from uh like the the Lessons

679
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,740
Learned in like marketing teams and like

680
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,200
big data teams and stuff where they're

681
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,760
basically they've collapsed all those

682
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,620
organizational silos around how they

683
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,840
manage their data into you know think

684
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,059
like big data Lake tools data breaks

685
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,460
snowflakes uh redshift things like that

686
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,580
and they're optimizing more on not like

687
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,260
building detection and response

688
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,440
capabilities in cluster but rather the

689
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,860
streaming ingestion pipes the ETL

690
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,900
pipelines that are bringing data in so

691
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,760
that way they have good structured data

692
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,799
with which to work and then they're

693
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,380
focused on re-skilling upskilling their

694
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,720
teams to be more like data analysts data

695
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,940
Engineers for example the last startup

696
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,020
that I was in

697
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,200
uh was this company Simon data it was a

698
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,700
marketing company you might think why

699
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,260
why in the world does marketing have

700
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,580
anything to do with federal health care

701
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,039
and it doesn't except for the fact that

702
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,260
I think most uh so I'm wearing all birds

703
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,320
right now now I could buy my all birds

704
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,360
off of an Instagram ad I could buy them

705
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,220
off of I could go to their website I

706
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,500
might buy them in a retailer I might see

707
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,179
a Facebook ad instead of an Instagram ad

708
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,360
and marketing similar to security and

709
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,100
this is a dynamic that exists in almost

710
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,100
every industry is you know all those

711
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,260
things represented different pockets of

712
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,240
data they lived in different places they

713
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,760
didn't synchronize with one another and

714
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,980
insight glean from Instagram did not

715
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,860
yield to insights or more targeted

716
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,600
advertising in the website or in Google

717
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,179
or what have you and marketers the team

718
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,860
that was marketers were more like

719
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,440
copywriters they're buying ads they're

720
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,140
doing stuff like that similar to cyber

721
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,640
security we had a lot of policy people

722
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,620
and a lot of operations people we didn't

723
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,419
have a lot of data engineers and

724
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,340
software Engineers so really we're

725
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,140
trying to take that same concept think

726
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,700
all the data that we as cyber security

727
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,980
people operate with and and will operate

728
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,080
with in the near future s-bombs

729
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,600
compliance uh like scan data you've got

730
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,860
vulnerability scan data you've got

731
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,020
pipeline outputs you've got

732
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,159
um you've got like uh like configuration

733
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,840
uh like scan data on your SAS tools

734
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,779
you've got Asset Management data both

735
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,580
from specific tools as well as

736
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,740
normalized in in some means you've got

737
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,460
maybe training data you've got logs all

738
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,980
of that stuff and you apply that to

739
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,559
scenarios like log4j where you could

740
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,779
kind of touch all those different parts

741
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,360
of the of your data ecosystem and if

742
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,880
they live in different places you can't

743
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,980
do that efficiently and effectively and

744
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,720
so this is really about like upskilling

745
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,760
our team to be able to do that more

746
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,520
effectively all built on top of like a

747
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,679
data data Lake back end so one of the

748
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,120
big things here is making sure that the

749
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
Batcave natively integrates with as a

750
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,880
data producer onto the data Lake and

751
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,580
then eventually as a data consumer

752
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,779
pulling stuff out of the data Lake to

753
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,059
enrich the stuff that we present back to

754
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,700
the dashboards and things like that to

755
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,120
the app teams so next slide

756
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,159
all right so a couple of the big

757
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,720
accomplishments that we're pretty proud

758
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,220
of at this stage

759
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,440
80 of

760
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,179
that says 100 it's not 100 it's 80

761
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,159
um Chris Hughes would beg to differ I'm

762
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,240
sure he would uh

763
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,120
there we go okay I like that answer

764
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,960
better

765
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,380
um it looks nicer so 80 fully inherited

766
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,100
of our 853 Baseline uh which we refer to

767
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,440
as ARS because you know we can't just

768
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,000
call things consistent names

769
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,380
um so

770
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,539
uh there's also a lot of

771
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,419
correlation and uh connection points

772
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,120
happening between Batcave and platform

773
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,220
of service and Engineering emphasis and

774
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,440
policy so one of the things that falls

775
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,899
under my group is we write policy that

776
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,240
informs the agency and so starting to

777
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,340
write policy that aligns with the road

778
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,039
map that we have at Batcave and and

779
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,600
other parts of these of the security

780
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,520
organization like when and where we're

781
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,679
going to start ingesting s-bombs where

782
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,360
you're going to be sending your logs how

783
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,159
you should be doing like if you're doing

784
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,500
continuous delivery how should that work

785
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,840
and so basically laying the groundwork

786
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,179
for adoption and value creation

787
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,179
here and then also this is something

788
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,799
that it's a little near and dear to me

789
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,480
given like I used to do a lot of red

790
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,600
teaming work in my former uh Consulting

791
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,539
life and so from day one we brought in

792
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,159
what's referred to as a purple team so

793
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,200
that's sort of the the

794
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,299
think red team think blue team sort of

795
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,740
sits right in between those two things

796
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,600
and they're acting as an interface point

797
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,659
between testing and like adversarial

798
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,000
emulation and testing and security

799
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,799
operations and detection and response

800
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,899
and then platform engineering like right

801
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,299
in the middle of that and like one of

802
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,860
the things that's an emphasis for this

803
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,779
team is not only like figuring out how

804
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:58,799
things are going to break like that's

805
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,980
important but taking the way that things

806
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,659
break and turning those translating

807
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,720
those into regression tests so that they

808
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,240
can go back and do the UPS like Upstream

809
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,159
deployment pipelines so that when

810
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,659
something breaks and we know it's going

811
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,100
to break that thing doesn't start

812
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,380
breaking again in the future think like

813
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,500
uh you you may have heard pen testers or

814
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,179
people who do security testing complain

815
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,919
that like they come back the next year

816
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,480
and I found the same things in the

817
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,860
client environment and that's annoying

818
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,840
or you know they they just you know they

819
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,059
uh they block my cross-aid scripting

820
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,860
payload and all they did was like filter

821
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,600
on my one thing and I just changed one

822
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,159
character and it worked again and like

823
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,799
so that sort of dynamic of regression

824
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,440
testing where every time that we do it

825
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,260
we're raising the floor on the overall

826
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,419
resiliency and security posture of the

827
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,880
platform and that that benefit is then

828
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,860
inherited by the tenant apps that go on

829
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,299
top of it

830
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,520
all right so this was

831
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,020
I'm going to spend a ton of time on this

832
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,480
slide but this was a one of the lead

833
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,279
Engineers for one of our early adopter

834
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,559
customers now this particular customer

835
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,279
was they were working in um in an

836
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,080
on-prem environment so deploying all

837
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,000
their stuff in a brick and mortar Data

838
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,220
Center and they were planning a

839
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,179
transition into AWS and so right off the

840
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,980
gates like they were they were looking

841
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,340
at like an 18-month time frame to do all

842
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,720
of that stuff to re-architect some

843
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,059
things re-architect their app to embrace

844
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,740
and work with like Cloud native

845
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,299
Solutions stuff like that set up their

846
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,480
new uh build deployment pipelines and

847
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
all of that stuff so we got our Clause

848
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,460
into them early on in these planning

849
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,840
migration discussions we knew some

850
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,340
people there and this is part of our

851
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,600
like early marketing strategies

852
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
internally and like we took their

853
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,559
18-month road map and we ended up

854
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,320
shrinking that down into like two and a

855
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,460
half three months and like that alone

856
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,100
like is is awesome and so something

857
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,539
we're really proud of we hope that it

858
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,700
can go even faster than that for future

859
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,440
migrations for future customers because

860
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,940
we learned a lot

861
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,380
um we're a little clunky like going

862
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,480
through this initial engagement

863
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,860
um you know because we're like basically

864
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,860
working within this broader construct of

865
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,919
other oit uh office of Information

866
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,500
Technology uh resources and so like

867
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,299
figuring out how best to work and

868
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,360
collaborate with them in the service of

869
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,100
the customer is something that like

870
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,539
we've learned a lot through this initial

871
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,760
engagement others like it and we're just

872
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
folding that back into the program so

873
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,940
every single run we're going to get

874
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,700
faster faster faster and more efficient

875
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,700
um all right so a big thing like

876
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,440
throughout this whole

877
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,140
talk we've been emphasizing

878
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,960
people and Partnerships and teamwork and

879
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,840
collaboration and so this is like this

880
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,000
is part of like part of this is doing

881
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,340
inside of like doing it inside of the

882
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,919
CMS context then part of it is working

883
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,700
across other agencies so across HHS I

884
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,039
think HHS is a collective cabinet agency

885
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,480
is one of the biggest in the government

886
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,799
I think FDA CDC NIH and HHS proper like

887
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,980
that covers a lot of the federal budget

888
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,019
and a lot of basically everything like

889
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,399
any time that you're interacting with

890
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,739
anything in the healthcare space in a

891
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,179
hospital

892
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,520
um or or what have you one of these

893
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,199
agencies touches something about that

894
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,859
and CMS inclusive so like sharing out

895
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,679
code Lessons Learned getting like design

896
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,659
Partners in early so we can start like

897
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,119
thinking about what other operating

898
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,580
divisions slash agencies are gonna like

899
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,080
the needs they're gonna have so we can

900
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,239
fold that in that's really really

901
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,580
important and then this other

902
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,980
bit like really leaning into a culture

903
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,020
of openness so this is something that's

904
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,000
important for our security team writ

905
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
large it's been uncomfortable for a lot

906
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,399
of people just being more transparent

907
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,800
being open sharing my deputy and I for

908
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,540
example we do monthly ask me anythings

909
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,040
we're like all of you if you wanted

910
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,379
could could join next uh next month like

911
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,500
we don't restrict them to anybody

912
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,420
um and we do and nothing is off the

913
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,800
table like you know we've talked about

914
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,420
wine and whiskey and some of them we've

915
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,160
talked about career advice we've talked

916
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,440
about uh security policy we talked about

917
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,060
tech stuff

918
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,800
um people try to like stump the chump on

919
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,119
you know like and we do all these things

920
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,280
live and that it makes people really

921
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,500
uncomfortable but what we wanted and

922
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,300
this program is a part of that is about

923
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,560
making security more accessible and and

924
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,540
like being able to con to empathize

925
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,940
through real world connection with other

926
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,560
people and that's just that's a real

927
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,220
important cultural value for us

928
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,020
um so with that we just wanted to say

929
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,119
thank you for taking the time this

930
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,280
morning to spend with us uh these are

931
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,380
all LinkedIn links if you have any

932
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,060
interest in following along with any of

933
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,099
the rants that we do or things that we

934
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,720
post on there

935
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,540
um and I think we have some yeah we've

936
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,680
got a little bit of time for questions

937
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,750
and uh yeah thank you so much everyone

938
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:59,469
[Applause]

939
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,480
yeah

940
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,119
are there any customers that have like

941
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,180
like a tenant application that would

942
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,820
have uh operate in that space

943
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,220
um right now

944
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,920
right now I don't think so

945
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,020
um they're more

946
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,820
um

947
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,040
like they're more like a traditional

948
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,560
apis or web applications stuff like that

949
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,140
I imagine that like yes we will get to

950
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,880
that like get to that place because

951
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,940
those sort of applications do exist

952
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,180
um in CMS the you know one of the things

953
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,140
that we've been trying to be very

954
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,060
cognizant of is like taking on the right

955
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,560
customers

956
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,560
both in terms of like status and and

957
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,480
influence inside the agency early on but

958
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,240
also like Tech complexity because with

959
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,660
every customer that adopts that's

960
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,940
burden reduced for not only them but for

961
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,280
us and for other parts of our I.T office

962
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,680
and so you know we don't want to get

963
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,140
muddled down in like a super complicated

964
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,380
deployment early on and we're we're not

965
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,480
going to learn a lot of like

966
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,180
replicable lessons and stuff like that

967
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,859
to other customers but you know we're

968
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,880
trying to so we're trying to be very

969
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,220
intentional now so that we can layer

970
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,780
like lay the groundwork for scaling and

971
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,460
I feel like you know that we'd have to

972
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,960
kind of pull out like what are the what

973
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,980
are going to be the bits that are very

974
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,740
applicable to a pipeline you know where

975
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,180
that like the pipeline is really going

976
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,220
to benefit that kind of app where does

977
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,040
it run and all of that stuff and so

978
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,099
um so not yet but I imagine soon

979
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,700
good question

980
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
all right go ahead

981
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,680
yeah so so like there's layers of that

982
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,859
across uh across like the AWS accounts

983
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,320
and stuff uh as you might imagine

984
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,700
um in some cases things that are like

985
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,500
internet facing and stuff do have laughs

986
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,000
in front of them

987
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,740
um which I think they're like I think we

988
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,119
could stand to do more of that even

989
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,920
internally

990
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,480
um you know like that runtime sort of

991
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,820
security introspection stuff

992
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,240
um and it's it's it's a growth area for

993
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,619
us in terms of like doing like basically

994
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,660
layering those in more places and it's

995
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,780
not even about in my mind like blocking

996
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,540
you know malicious traffic I think

997
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,220
one of the big benefits is being able to

998
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,960
create like these virtual patches it's

999
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,880
like you find something and before you

1000
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
can fix it in code you can get like a

1001
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
virtual patch out to like prevent a

1002
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,640
thing from happening or like block you

1003
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,260
know a cluster of ips that are that's

1004
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,940
doing something or a pattern of of

1005
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,339
traffic and then you know basically buy

1006
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,740
yourself some time to fix the issue in

1007
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,599
code and so like that's something that

1008
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,220
like generally speaking not just for

1009
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,200
Batcave deployments is is like quite

1010
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,460
relevant for our like security

1011
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,680
engineering teams

1012
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,579
um

1013
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:57,660
yeah

1014
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,379
it's a good question

1015
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,700
all right well thank you so much

1016
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,320
everyone we're gonna like be hanging

1017
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,940
around for uh the rest of the day so

1018
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,920
come and chat and uh come get stickers

1019
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,960
if you want them and uh yeah have a good

1020
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,350
