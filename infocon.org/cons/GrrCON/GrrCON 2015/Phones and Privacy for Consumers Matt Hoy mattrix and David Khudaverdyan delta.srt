00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,289
good afternoon

2
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,849
I'm going to be doing a presentation
based on consumer device and the

3
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:29,089
security around consumer devices which
is basically getting me a little bit mad

4
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:30,429
these days

5
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:38,309
share I'm metrics on Twitter I'm a
principal consultant for adoptive I was

6
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:46,479
supposed to have a co-presenter today
and that would have been David Davao he

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:54,379
basically was a lot of the technical
information in regard to the talk myself

8
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:59,100
I've been practicing information
security for quite some time and I kinda

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,309
needed to get some of his techniques and
here so it was just natural that I

10
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,290
teamed up with him and actually have a
talk with him but unfortunately he

11
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:21,040
couldn't make it so basically this talk
is about consumer devices it originally

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,470
started with me just talking about
what's the difference between the

13
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,830
privacy of iOS and Android but it seems
they've gotta hadn't knocked around

14
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:39,360
specifically with our devices all the
way down to our computers computer 0

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,530
asses are no longer exactly the way that
they used to be which are pretty

16
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,030
dedicated to just running the programs
that are on it now they've kinda had

17
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,950
netted cool things like the cloud on it

18
00:01:51,950 --> 00:02:00,869
and the sad part is all these classes
and the actual classes on your hardware

19
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,130
just becoming more invasive by default

20
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:10,729
show the general consumer has no idea
and then all the default settings out of

21
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:18,660
the box and I found unfortunately even
within our own community people aren't

22
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,519
actually going ahead and making gold
standards and turning off all this stuff

23
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:32,360
share this talk is actually gonna go
cover am I going to go ahead and trust

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,390
the device I'm going to talk about the
issues with a lot of the specific oh I

25
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,110
says I'm actually gonna go ahead and
talk about how r gonna go ahead and turn

26
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,870
off these things will go ahead and look
at this as if we were actually being

27
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:55,440
targeted share in my previous talking
about tailored access operations in

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:04,670
which the computers or devices that you
have are actually intercepted before you

29
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,019
get them and their shrink wrap items in
which basically your devices compromise

30
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,300
before he even got it bad I couldn't
deal with that

31
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:23,080
we also had numerous fails in which well
Lenovo laptops had a nice things for you

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,920
that you really don't gating like
superfish things like that and other

33
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,040
words you really really should go ahead
and even if your consumer or within an

34
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,590
enterprise make sure you wipe these
things down start fresh every time you

35
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:49,950
get a chance she'll consider you have to
go ahead and consider what cloud am I

36
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,110
going to go ahead and use if it's a
mobile device

37
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:59,080
what carrier on my actually using what
apps to actually use on any of the

38
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,160
mobile devices and do i trust them

39
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,730
gonna talk about the nice advances in
mobile security some of the failures

40
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,530
invasive operating system defaults and I
shouldn't have to answer this but we we

41
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,280
willingly allow people to have their
invasion

42
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:33,130
software crap were built in the machines
so yes to a trust that bad privacy

43
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:40,760
settings SIM card security iCloud

44
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:50,780
now where you're going to do now a clean
sheet of ice and he has a items you

45
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,830
should automatically go ahead and wipe
it by wiping it you need to do what is

46
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:03,750
known as a device firmware update a DFU
now jonathan's it or she is actually

47
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,310
done a lot of research on this and he
says that if you do this three times

48
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:16,200
anything that was in there is new my
co-presenter actually goes ahead and

49
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,510
says yeah you do times it's good enough
I'm paranoid I do three past whenever I

50
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,110
have an Android device

51
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:31,330
unfortunately they don't sign their
software share I don't really have an

52
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,770
elegant solution to clean that device
the best I can do is wipe dalvik caches

53
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:45,180
and do these factory reset I'll go ahead
and do that at least a few times and at

54
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,630
least go ahead and wipe everything that
I possibly can

55
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,720
the difficult to the difficulty that we
have between iOS and Android as far as

56
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,110
dumping things is it's actually signed
in it goes up against a a digitally

57
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,210
signed certificate Android they don't
sign their software this is kind of a

58
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,810
problem when you want to go ahead and
dump everything and then start over

59
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:19,540
fresh actually house valid only a SPECT
software

60
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,580
on a Mac Macintosh computer which happen
to be using now

61
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:31,470
first thing you should do is new path
soccer it gets a little bit dicey and

62
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,190
the fact that I have said don't really
want to be hearing this thing out too

63
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,500
many times

64
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:45,680
David actually found a way around this
so yes I is basically do it and

65
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,170
extensible firmware interface allows me
to go had either USB Drive or DVD

66
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:59,260
external what does that by me basically
what it buys me is the fact that I go

67
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:06,140
ahead and I get to take a Windows or
Linux CD and wipe this disc rain I'm

68
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,030
actually not taking Ohio ash I'm
actually taking another operating system

69
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:17,200
making sure I wipe the Shocker clean
dumping everything off and then from

70
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:26,010
there actually going ahead and having a
restart from Apple getting a fresh and

71
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,070
wash now when I actually go ahead and
take and Windows or Linux partition in

72
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,010
device and I wipe this drive clean it
actually removes a recovery partition

73
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,340
one of the nice things as is I don't
even have to worry about a recovery

74
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,410
partition being there with things that I
don't know that are in there my drives

75
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,950
clean

76
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:58,270
will talk about your regular x86
computer if you can upgrade your hard

77
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,900
drive Dennis st

78
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:08,310
nice new fresh 10 that out before you
even get started on that and I hadn't

79
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:18,300
create your standard would partition
with irregular hard drive tools the

80
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:29,389
original talk was on the iOS privacy
granularity and it allows you to have

81
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:36,180
granularity on all these items first
thing you're gonna want to go ahead and

82
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,849
do is your gonna want to go ahead and
make sure that you going to your

83
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:48,790
location services and get rid of items
their shares

84
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:55,810
silly you gotta privacy here straight to
location services and you can actually

85
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:03,510
go ahead and like in the old Blackberry
days assign permissions each app why

86
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:12,650
Twitter need access to my GPS
coordinates why Evernote need access to

87
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,750
my GPS coordinates I'm not going to go
ahead give it to him but it's amazing

88
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,830
how many people actually will take a nap
and just go ahead and say okay I'll

89
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:29,580
everything and they do give you dummy
boxes to go ahead and say allow this or

90
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,220
not all this must have a time when
people are installing ups they needed it

91
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,400
yesterday so they don't pay attention to
the little boxes it's ok this is where

92
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,730
you go back to go ahead and fix that at
any given time you can go ahead and go

93
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,250
into naps permissions and later ok but
wait there's more

94
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:00,250
we now have a $9.00 to and we now have
new hardware

95
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,890
one of the things that they went ahead
and added in here is this whole thing

96
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,160
called spotlight search sadly I know
you're not going to be able to see this

97
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,230
and I unfortunately didn't have enough
time to add screenshots but basically

98
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:21,400
spotlight search gives you this in which
it does about your contacts and knows

99
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,050
about what apps he is and it integrates
with maps because yeah you totally need

100
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,110
to know they sang while my family
doesn't because I disable the thing

101
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:41,270
websearch results and i actually
disabled the spotlight suggestions if

102
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:48,690
you don't disable spotlight suggestions
it basically allows iOS and iCloud to

103
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,660
communicate with each other to actually
go ahead and look at how you use your

104
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,310
found what they wanted to go ahead and
do is make it protective so that at this

105
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,540
time I'm probably going to go take a
drive my car

106
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,780
I probably want to go ahead and launch
the Spotify I don't think they really

107
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:16,980
need to know about my behavior patterns
so I'm not doing it so near to the

108
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:24,620
actual I found success hardware have the
single life great idea because it comes

109
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,440
on by default it's actually kind of a
cold comes out I whip out my camera it

110
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,420
has this live photo mode with the sly
fair amount does it actually takes video

111
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,670
and audio 43 seconds before I actually
go ahead and take the picture what has

112
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,760
happened to be at a wedding and
somebody's drunk and somebody does the

113
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,850
self and talks crap about people this is
recorded forever

114
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,330
not only that it is straight to the
iCloud when already now I don't like the

115
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,440
way they do their multi-factor
authentication there yet others I'm

116
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,520
short comments and everything else could
actually be embarrassing because he

117
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,200
literally just have a 30 second hot mic
here

118
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:24,090
general privacy granularity when does it
ask you when it needs access to the

119
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,560
microphone when it needs access to your
contacts

120
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:34,280
sher o basically go ahead and you're
going to have to deal with that in the

121
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:42,530
settings and privacy change your mind
there's some out unfortunately that are

122
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:48,490
built in to inherent Lee that you're not
going to go ahead and change those would

123
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:55,220
be male this would be your messages I
messages you have to check the default

124
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,280
things are built and hardwired into the
US for everything else you can go into

125
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,850
the settings and privacy and go back and
each happens say well let's go ahead and

126
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,380
turn off location let's turn off
microphone let's turn off contacts are

127
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:20,380
already went ahead and glossed over this
earlier Shane about location privacy but

128
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:28,870
their specific settings in there and
flag for location important challenge I

129
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:37,040
hadn't if you don't ever want your GPA
has to be accessed slacked never

130
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,250
never means it's not going to go had
actually use GPS my favor one which is a

131
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:51,540
balances I think reasonable things is
well using that because i dont wanna say

132
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,009
they were never use my location because
I actually need you to pick me up and

133
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:02,980
this is useful but I want to at least
have had me about the find me and then

134
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:10,649
there's always which is a pervasive on
any app that always ask for always I'm

135
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:19,699
probably gonna uninstall it basically
keep it simple either the app has access

136
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:26,880
or doesn't share we're gonna go ahead
and talk about the privacy granularity

137
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:35,810
Syrian iCloud they spy on you straight
up and once you disable

138
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:42,380
location history is the equivalent to
Google Maps location history and which

139
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,870
it gives you bread crumbs of everywhere
you've ever visited

140
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:52,660
share a well you can go ahead and use it
you actually can go ahead and tell it I

141
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,390
only want you to go ahead and take my
location

142
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:01,670
never or while using it mindset to have
her and of course your safari history

143
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:09,350
but this actually gets to our I was
talking about multiple devices Safari

144
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,029
history chrome browser all these
browsers think they're being helpful to

145
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:19,140
you by allowing you to go ahead and
shamelessly hand off this session that

146
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:25,600
you're at when you arrived for their
role for sale I'm looking at Safari on

147
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:34,320
my iPhone I was browsing this on my turn
on my my Mac OSX turn on my iPad I'm

148
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,060
looking at the same exact thing on all
these devices I think that's pretty

149
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,160
creepy because I don't actually want
bread crumbs where I've been not only

150
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,610
that if I accidentally had bad security
practices never ever locked my desktop

151
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:57,029
computer and somebody had access to my
desktop computer that can see everything

152
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:04,560
that I was doing so how do you disable
it turn it off there are other things

153
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,060
that you can do and side of town which
is change your advertising idea I kinda

154
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,570
tend to do this like once a month but
advertising i think is really

155
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,760
interesting because

156
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,170
yeltsin's Ohio ass actually went ahead
and check your MAC address to make it a

157
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,550
unique identifier so when you're walking
around with their wifi on and your

158
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,110
Bluetooth

159
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:37,020
apparently they've got ahead and made it
so that it just this random advertising

160
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,400
idea she knows where you've been

161
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,250
it's kind of creepy those same people
that make the center Matic tags for loss

162
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,530
prevention have now started putting an
beacons and stores to actually go ahead

163
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,880
and look for your Bluetooth and talk
back and forth chair found as a proxy

164
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:02,630
item with a show called unique idea to
reset that often make sure you go ahead

165
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:08,160
and turn off your unused services there
was recently a security flaw which is

166
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,120
why $9 to was introduced in which

167
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:20,000
basically a five-under same network it
could cause an infection need to go

168
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,949
ahead and turn off things like airdrop
car player for not using it

169
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:29,080
fact I don't care if its iOS or Android
if you're not using a service why do you

170
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,640
leave it on even wash we leave these
services on an actual enterprise

171
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:43,280
machines and servers turning off your
not using the other thing that's the

172
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,929
fatal flaw is when people set up their
funds and set up a lock screens by

173
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:53,720
default what people don't realize is in
ILS you don't turn off the control

174
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,890
center notifications I get to go ahead
and read all your emails anyway as just

175
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,030
as a guy hadn't pop up

176
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:09,290
you need to go ahead and make sure that
you limit sherry they decided to be like

177
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:16,800
champs and every other day like Google
now which is hager going everything else

178
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,840
that this Mike needs to be that's pretty
bad

179
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,700
basically you say hey

180
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:31,550
and then I found mike is listening and
shit actually go ahead and activate Siri

181
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:37,390
turn that off another way of it you're
giving a person an attack vector

182
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:43,320
have physical access to the phone now
once again you have to remember none of

183
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,540
your devices are ever going to be secure
once you actually lose physical access

184
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:56,930
we'll have to clean all over again every
single time I'm gonna go ahead and talk

185
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:07,990
about the Android privacy granularity or
not these issues I was talking about

186
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:14,880
well I don't really have the ability to
and once again this is getting awesome

187
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,450
crash because I had this argument with
him he's using the 1+1 and they actually

188
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,520
gave you granularity but apparently if
you turn off location services for

189
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,790
Google Play none of the rest of the OPs
work show I guess you have to give

190
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:36,480
Google your location no matter what so
how do I deal with this problem I'm not

191
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,990
gonna route to justify rare and I
accidentally leave my wife or my

192
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,100
bluetooth on all makes it that much
easier for my attacker just grabbed my

193
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,890
entire found one of the ways around this
week literally went ahead and did was go

194
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,770
ahead and just grab the Android SDK
every time I haven't happened it has way

195
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:06,050
too many of these permissions like my
location I can go ahead and not grant

196
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,300
that within the manifest

197
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,210
the problem is I don't have time for
this because I'm always on the road so

198
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,830
basically if I'm messing with her at
mana fast I'm probably breaking the

199
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,680
application and this is going to take a
major story goes had it before actually

200
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,880
make this thing work why I wanted to
work and basically a general consumers

201
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,600
never gonna have a chance to even do
this they are addressing this in

202
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,130
marshmallow in the new one and they're
going to go ahead and turn on the

203
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,890
privacy options

204
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,760
basically the only way you're going to
get this is my new device that is

205
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,970
actually a Google Nexus like device and
that's the only way you're going to have

206
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:02,880
a granularity in each app once again the
1+1 on the CyanogenMod was brought up to

207
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,830
me by vis it does do this however even
all the betas Google Play will not allow

208
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,049
you to disable location services

209
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:21,259
share yeah I believe it or not Google
spies on you as well they do it pretty

210
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:24,290
much the same way does its

211
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:30,180
the best I can go ahead and do is go
into the application's drawer and look

212
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,640
at every single

213
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:40,700
up in their site up the Settings button
and this is what I get I basically get

214
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:48,990
this is going to do what it's going to
do and i cant change any of this crap I

215
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:55,559
can't change any of its

216
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:02,919
some other security research her I
forgot to go ahead and quote because

217
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,679
I've just redesignation tire slides
basically has said the difficulties is

218
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:15,999
once you register any of your devices
onto the cloud you're basically never be

219
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:21,210
able to go ahead and confidently resell
your found without remnants of the data

220
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,180
being there ever

221
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:31,970
so things that you can go ahead and do
to prevent things from fine on use

222
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,040
actually go to your account settings
which everybody should now but once

223
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,620
again this is for the general consumers
well as you need to go ahead and at

224
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,560
least turn off some of these things this
happens even on your machine on the

225
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,590
computer level when you use Chrome in
fact that

226
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:59,890
this will be convenience and I'm opening
up tabs on my browsers this world and

227
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:05,340
put it on every machine of Emer I've
ever used yeltsin interesting and tax

228
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,740
factor which I thought a riches I have
to go ahead and do as if I hated someone

229
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,450
is make sure I log into google chrome
and hopefully and then closed everything

230
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:22,260
down and leave one of my Google Chrome
sessions logged into my session pointing

231
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:29,289
to a malware page and when they log when
they launched under my profile logo to

232
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:33,840
the page that visited that was hostile
but that's another story another piece

233
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:41,120
of researchers working on anyways so it
actually has a haddon spies on you and

234
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,450
takes very decent details of where you
travel I kind of thought it was cool

235
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:53,450
because the first year I was consulting
actually matched up how many miles and

236
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,310
where I've been in the world and
everything else

237
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:01,440
and you actually have to opt out of this
and manually delete it but once again

238
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,310
this has every device every device that
i've ever

239
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:16,910
and i can claim those devices out I knew
Cano houses because Android and it gets

240
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,830
better

241
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:28,740
level we now have windows 10-10 has
Cortana Windows town is basically a

242
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:38,640
Serie A or Google now it's constantly
constantly listening share in your

243
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,300
Windows going to go ahead and start from
scratch if you're dealing with either 8

244
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:52,670
14 10 the best way to defeat
automatically get the Microsoft one

245
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,120
drive Microsoft cloud Microsoft
everything in there

246
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,690
you hadn't chillier internet connections
and do it off of physical media

247
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:08,330
otherwise by default all these things
are going to be turned on

248
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,130
share

249
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:17,950
in Windows I'm going to go ahead and
want to just say I'm definitely not

250
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:26,450
going to want their Microsoft cloud and
there's already another trusted then you

251
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,180
can go ahead and Google which is called
what should i block on my firewall for

252
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,960
Windows 10 if I'm going to use it you
can literally just google it by that

253
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,170
it's a ton of a sales and at other
things to go ahead and make sure there's

254
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,630
no communication on OSX isn't any better

255
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:57,470
Utah Jazz had once again when I just see
this when I turn on the machine his its

256
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,130
gonna ask you connect to the internet
immediately I'm not going to go ahead

257
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,220
and do that I'm going to skip the step
when it tells me set up your WiFi

258
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:13,890
because the first thing it's kinda wanna
do is sign up for its iCloud if you

259
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,180
accidentally do it you can go ahead and
on China out later but it tends to be a

260
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,730
little bit persistent when you log into
other things and there once you've

261
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,430
actually set the damn thing up it
doesn't like going away I would go ahead

262
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:34,150
and I do anyhow I clean start with a
fresh a lasting Han

263
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,220
show ever since

264
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,910
yosemite has been around and has this
thing called spotlight just like they

265
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:48,610
were adding chair found it wants to
learn what you do on your computer and

266
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,890
actually is going to have contracted
going ahead and tracking what you do on

267
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:59,010
the computer all the way down to
keystrokes anytime you go ahead and hit

268
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:06,420
the Apple space bar just to go out and
find and text items on my harddrive now

269
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,190
I don't know about you guys

270
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:14,610
whenever I do searches like hitting the
spacebar and just typing in the power

271
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:20,410
outages I don't have to mess around when
does 10 basically it doesn't have

272
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:26,940
spotlight but it has Windows Search
unless you turn off Windows 10 church

273
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:35,110
it's doing the same thing for purposes
of helping here its index and grabbing

274
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,830
all the key logs of everything you're
typing into spotlight so that it can

275
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:46,020
learn about you and be that much more
helpful that's kind of a bad what if I'm

276
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:53,910
like typing in embarrassing things like
the names of its going to actually go

277
00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:01,130
through and houses in an iCloud or
Microsoft's Bing Microsoft's cloud and

278
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,120
it's probably gonna keep history even
though they say

279
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:11,380
we use an optimized yrs ago had an
anonymized data but how does an

280
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,100
optimized it has all the really need a
single IP

281
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:21,480
so to go ahead and get rid of this tax
make sure that you actually use

282
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,510
spotlight kill the stamp thing which is
the space bar and type in spotlight it

283
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:33,070
makes no sense you can't find it when
you go to the General Settings when you

284
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:40,039
do it's tough going to be there so once
you get to those settings need to once

285
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:47,080
again it's at the very bottom I'm check
the allow spotlight suggestions and get

286
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,450
rid of bank for some reason Microsoft
and Apple has just decided to get

287
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:59,080
together with each other and whenever I
have to disable iCloud have to disable

288
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,770
being

289
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:07,750
its court on all over again even though
I genuine by a Microsoft product other

290
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,230
things you have to go ahead and do is
they have privacy default settings

291
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:18,669
inside the Mac once again get rid of San
diagnostic

292
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:24,750
really need all my crash crash down
today it has pretty cool stuff like my

293
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:30,230
location or what it is I was typing are
doing you have to get rid of that on the

294
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,929
phone as well I don't really like to go
ahead and share the crash now they just

295
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:41,230
have way too much information

296
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,200
not even Linux is sacred anymore

297
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:53,710
into it left and decided hey all these
guys are doing these analytics on our

298
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,230
users we should too

299
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:09,030
problem is you're probably gonna go with
the bench here because you don't know

300
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:14,890
any better I mean variance to basically
is like Windows seven acts like it and

301
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,010
it comes with his piece of crap called
Unity desktop that is installed by

302
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:25,580
default because most consumer users are
not going to go ahead and go ahead and

303
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,900
remove this input gnome or KDE and that
they're going to take the default bill

304
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:37,309
and they're going to say I'm at Unity
desktop it sounds pretty cool while

305
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:44,510
they're not bed with Microsoft this time
I don't have to disable bang show why

306
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,360
does it searched the web by default so
basically once again anytime I'm

307
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,799
searching for an index on Unity desktop
it's automatically going out Google

308
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:04,530
search or it's looking through my index
of files on hard drives so how do I

309
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,890
disable it

310
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:12,509
yeah I install it a real

311
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:18,229
environment on it supposedly you can go
into the Unity tweak tool and then you

312
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:25,179
have to go ahead and run a package just
to go ahead and undo the tweak tool but

313
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:31,389
once again usually general consumer
isn't going to go ahead and even be that

314
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:38,679
advanced or even realize what it's doing
so we have to go ahead and then ask Sam

315
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,159
everything connects to the cloud
everything connects me to the internet

316
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:50,659
I'm not gonna skip the shower my share
unfortunately we do have to choose

317
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:51,920
things

318
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,240
could go they make money from targeted
advertising how do I get a better idea

319
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,620
is to figure out you need to know what
happens you're running I need to go

320
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:11,610
ahead and she grabbing everything I know
about you to push his targeted

321
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,800
advertising at you by reading your
emails and everything else

322
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,430
iCloud they want you to pay for it they
take your money they give you the first

323
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:29,220
five-year tree problem that I have with
this is have had issues before I don't

324
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,640
like what they deemed to be multi-factor
authentication a text message is not a

325
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,350
multi-factor authentication Google got
this right they built on a cheerleader

326
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:46,580
Microsoft there near to the space just
seems thing in court on our the evil ass

327
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:54,230
holes of the bunch but we're going to go
ahead and allow him to do things I'm

328
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,770
actually using these days because they
check who goes authentic Air turn I

329
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:05,090
don't get all the weird ads and all the
other crap gmail has been actually

330
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,550
sending out man it doesn't feel as
invasive honestly just because this is

331
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:16,790
consumer email and I just can't seem to
go ahead and get away from a if you're

332
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,870
really going to be serious about secure
email you're going to actually use an

333
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:29,650
email client and PGP or GPG she GDP and

334
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:35,610
the problem is as much as I'd like to go
ahead and build my keys and give them

335
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,520
the other people nobody else can be
bothered to actually go ahead and use

336
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,620
them so if I encrypt it nobody's going
to read the message house timer don't

337
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,850
know how box they actually go ahead and
take your money I'll sell out for

338
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:59,530
multi-factor authentication if I have to
store and drop stuff around

339
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:07,510
they're pretty good other factors we
have to get back to you as well we're

340
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,690
stuck with carriers now

341
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:16,940
everybody knows that when we use a
device they were actually proxy and all

342
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,970
your traffic and using a super cookie or
at least if you did know you need to

343
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:28,849
know and a lot of us in the security
community and privacy community when I

344
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:34,619
hadn't pitched about it on Twitter and
wrote these people a lot of a lot of

345
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,290
hate mail Verizon now allows you to go
ahead and hopped out of the super comfy

346
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:46,329
and I'm going to happen proxy
unfortunately a change he went back to

347
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:50,339
go ahead and actually middle in your
traffic and we don't know if they're

348
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,720
ever going to allow you to go

349
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,099
knocked out there when you go ahead and
choose your actual devices need to

350
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:02,900
actually take a look at the track record
of who's actually providing you your

351
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,920
trans honestly none of this really
matters because

352
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,840
/ gonna go ahead

353
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:21,670
peter is enough to go haven't set up an
Android and iOS and are no longer using

354
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,640
your carrier's internet back when I
could opt out well should I trust my

355
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,540
care anyway

356
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:38,670
probably not and he'll now show actually
used to VPNs myself a sleepy and usually

357
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,500
for pen test and but the problem that I
found out when I have been on the road

358
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,750
and actually need to use VPN for
legitimate purpose because I'm in Canada

359
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:57,540
or in europe that a speech and is so
dirty and blacklisted it's of no use to

360
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:04,800
me to even do any bank in or anything
else even though its main so I had to go

361
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,270
ahead and find a pretty anonymous one
was for general use now changed private

362
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,810
Internet access

363
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:19,680
had to go ahead and set up things for
people who are less sophisticated truly

364
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,440
truly consumers uses Viper v-twin the
reason why he uses it is it has a very

365
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,650
down clients that damn fine actually
allows people to go ahead and just

366
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,580
launched in now and all the sudden I
have a VPN I sacking ahead and teach

367
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:40,320
people just to go ahead and get into
network too few more clicks and then

368
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:47,280
turn on there but it all depends on you
know the end user how well are they

369
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:56,079
going to be versed at using these things

370
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:05,259
and I've gone through quite a few dif
apps for enhanced privacy I'm using

371
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:11,380
signal for Android you should be using
ride founder Shakira text these are all

372
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:17,489
known to most of our community and I'm
telling you this and speaking to people

373
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:18,989
already know this stuff

374
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:24,049
one of the things that I found to be
understand was burner and burners pretty

375
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:28,069
good because we all have his occasional
I need to go ahead and move into new

376
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:35,209
apartment I really don't wanna give
people an actual cell phone number it's

377
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:40,719
been actually helped her helpful for
things like finding an apartment and it

378
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:46,519
also gives me a lair privacy or if I'm
dating someone and I just don't know how

379
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:53,890
well enough and use out further
basically as a virtual sound and sight

380
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:59,799
of their iOS or Android and it actually
came to the scale of economies in which

381
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:06,119
it's still cheaper than buying a truck
fine and one last thing I have to carry

382
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,930
around I like iMessage right now and I
like I message because it's pissing off

383
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:20,359
the surface and is the FBI and everybody
else says we have to go ahead and tell

384
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:25,969
how Paul we need access to the
encryption and I message and I keep

385
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:31,930
telling them it's not possible that's a
canary to watch everything should use

386
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:39,459
multi-factor authentication and for that
I use Google authenticator

387
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:42,720
hadn't talked about the good and the bad

388
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,200
it became apparent to me that I needed
to go ahead and eventually ditch my

389
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,920
blackberry which held on for dear life
forever and the advances were Android

390
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,270
finally give me full device encryption
and they did that lollipop that actually

391
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:11,680
fully they also did a study card
decryption yeah some here going what the

392
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,109
hell is that because they don't even
give you that option anymore and iOS 7

393
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:22,030
it was hardware-based encryption but
wasn't full device encryption or an ATM

394
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:29,220
around that's about the time I decided
to go hands which now I S nine forces

395
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:36,010
you to use a whole six digits for your
pen but depends pretty much a bad idea

396
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:45,290
Android well thanks for staying longer
pass but they have a slight problem with

397
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:51,140
you using for postured right now in
which somebody figured out a bypass and

398
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:57,280
it's a fun thing to read about back to
the lousy six digit weather pattern lock

399
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,310
because until they actually fix a tax
break for the long basket

400
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:11,280
we're not going to go ahead and be able
to effectively used baskets 26 presently

401
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:19,770
sixth one of the biggest exploits is is
Android is carrier-based I can't go

402
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:27,460
ahead and get an upgrade and updates
from iOS unless carrier says it's ok for

403
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:34,490
now we're not going to go ahead and play
with what the carrier allows me to do

404
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:39,100
we're gonna go ahead and push software
updates so at least I have a little bit

405
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,110
more security built in for security
update switches

406
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:52,330
least I can go ahead and choose to
update my my device fails and red

407
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:58,920
lollipop basically doesn't turn
encryption on out of the box I'll ask

408
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:10,160
does an out of the box somebody must
listen to my talk last time I gave it an

409
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,900
Android app store they have

410
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:20,530
a handful of applications that are
vulnerable to freak SL and chill has

411
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:30,760
issues I last ate which finally shakes
with nine the complex password bug was

412
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:40,580
an issue and needs to be addressed and
essentially well what we have is a

413
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:48,550
security and a series of massive fails
but what's even scarier has even if I go

414
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,450
ahead and secure my device I wipe clean
I do all this stuff there is this whole

415
00:41:54,450 --> 00:42:00,360
thing where Jamal tell entire SIM card
plant its compromise so once again

416
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,790
everybody has the keys to the noun SIM
cards so I'm pretty much screwed anyways

417
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:14,350
if you want to go ahead and do something
to me there for ya think about your care

418
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,100
about the device you're going to get
think about her going to configure it

419
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,560
how did this happen

420
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,520
well a lot of you guys aren't consumers
you guys are security people and we let

421
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,829
this happen

422
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:34,069
basically people went ahead develop
these not be secure

423
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:39,779
yeah we didn't stop it we've never
reviewed it we all out

424
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:42,510
developers to turn on all these

425
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:48,050
invasive things by to fall where we
should actually go ahead and say these

426
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:54,130
are features you need to turn a mom has
a dead kennedys said give me convenience

427
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,830
or give me death that's that's what
really happened here will turn out all

428
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:09,360
the shit shall inform conclusion check
your settings clean most of us

429
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,370
other conferences I think DEFCON awesome
time during image all my shed tell

430
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,700
whoever had everything on me basically
losses or trail because I'm wiping

431
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,020
cleaning everything or replacing
hardware right after dusk on so that's

432
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,900
my annual courage

433
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:35,710
need to go ahead and be mindful logging
into the cloud that includes browsers

434
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:41,589
your safari your crowd anything that
actually goes ahead and requires a login

435
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:45,920
if you can

436
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,230
one of the settings I do forever
browsing is private mode isn't good

437
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:54,410
enough screw private mad because all it
does is not remember things but it still

438
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:58,190
keeps your cookies it still keeps
everything else you need to go ahead and

439
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:03,460
say white this damn thing every time I'm
done it really really paranoid you're

440
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,720
gonna go ahead and build the vietnam a
new one every time and use up for

441
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:14,380
browsing and never ever touch her host
OS but that's just plain not practical

442
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:20,200
and I'm really not doing anything and
anybody should really care about using

443
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,800
he plans to change location

444
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,670
even though I'm here my traffic says I'm
still coming from LA when I'm in LA my

445
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:38,089
traffic says it's coming from New York
learn about your operating system

446
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:43,920
whenever they do these point releases
the watch now what you really want to go

447
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,920
ahead and look for is all the EULA and
the things that are buried at the very

448
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,859
very very very bottom of the
documentation saying this is here to

449
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:56,589
help you anytime many things in there
saying new improved feature I'm probably

450
00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:01,510
gonna wanna turn it off because I don't
understand what they're doing and if you

451
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:05,589
don't understand what the hell it still
turn it off anyways because if you don't

452
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:11,000
miss it it probably doesn't need to be
on

453
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,289
once again when you get a new Mac
computer

454
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:26,339
why we need to clean when you get a new
windows box we need to clean make sure

455
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:33,130
that you go ahead and turn off your
internet connections do not enable your

456
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,630
wife I unplug your internet and
basically you're going to be fine

457
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:45,839
a lot of those invasive portada services
and the key logging and everything else

458
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,259
don't turn on by default because it
never ever could

459
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:58,939
when you don't have an actual when you
don't actually have the cloud setting

460
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:04,239
everything up for you this whole thing
about windows and sharing your

461
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:10,899
wifi password and SSID to contact you
have it can't happen if you're not

462
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:18,069
trying to do the cloud so it was a
controversy but the thing of it is when

463
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:23,669
you actually use iCloud every time you
turn on a device it memorized is your

464
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:29,099
wife I said in so it's also in the
clouds everybody's doing this you are

465
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,289
going to go ahead and backup your iOS
device make sure you go ahead and turn

466
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:33,979
it off

467
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:40,449
don't use a cloud actually use a
computer that you lost it and back it up

468
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:45,099
there and turn on the encryption because
at least they don't have the ability to

469
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:50,109
take my computer that I have now and
still the encryption key off at this

470
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:54,749
health actually go ahead and read my
house when you're gonna need a weren't

471
00:46:54,749 --> 00:47:00,869
true that so I'm traveling never have
any devices either Android or I last

472
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:08,999
part with your computer because it
actually did a key exchange share and if

473
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:13,619
I don't have anything in the clout well
you can't get to it or not gonna get my

474
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,089
backup should not gonna get my keys and
I'm gonna get jack off now without a

475
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:28,029
warrant so the paranoid inclusion throw
your smart found out star Faraday cage

476
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:30,040
never leave

477
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:38,520
outdoors basically everything that I've
talked about should be good enough to go

478
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,100
ahead and make sure that you throw off
something that may be invasive that

479
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:49,000
somebody would try to God and plant on
you you're not going to go ahead and do

480
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,160
a nation state we have to actually know
the actor who's trying to go ahead and

481
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,310
attack you but by changing so many
things up all the time I'm definitely

482
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:04,460
gonna piss off advertisers just not
gonna love being in my life I'm

483
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:14,090
definitely not letting office cloud crap
away so I guess my advertising just but

484
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:20,800
then again crap Amazon said they have a
daughter Shannon many ways shall any

485
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:30,230
questions yes

486
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:36,470
it's actually closed and because it's
been closed and because they actually

487
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:43,400
charge you for it once again the general
consumer isn't going to actually access

488
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,880
something like that have a did have
their own problems in which they did

489
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,590
have a compromise with key system and it
lost everything in the in the clear I'm

490
00:48:53,590 --> 00:49:01,170
thinking that signal had fun and text
that should be just as good as I have it

491
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,260
for free

492
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:09,270
honestly once again what is it that I'm
protecting against the casual snapper

493
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:13,070
I'm not going to I don't even know that
silent check would be good enough

494
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:18,890
against a nation state due to the fact
that they have unlimited amount of

495
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:25,450
resources and anybody with an infinite
amount of resources basically get it

496
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:29,840
they probably can go ahead just kidnap
you anyways and crabby and rubber hose

497
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,240
technique it out of you

498
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,830
show once again you have to think about
your threat that turn what it is you're

499
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:44,260
trying to defend against anyone else
already thank you
