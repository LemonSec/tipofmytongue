3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,900
coming to this talk this is punch
counter-punch

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,689
it's actually part to write so the
original punch counter-punch I did occur

5
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:33,660
comic two or three years ago it was
client-side dotnet code you know house

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:50,629
once talked about and we're gonna break
it and you caught that talk the talk and

7
00:00:50,629 --> 00:01:02,790
developers 2012 so this is where you be
looking at web apps just

8
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,530
disclaimers so

9
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:23,420
was born I don't you guys can see it but
there's always be attached or sexy faces

10
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:36,290

wait to add a bad problem between chris

11
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:54,149
Robertson and I do it full-time now
representing employers but I'm with CBI

12
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,319
we got a booth so we're one sponsors
come and visit but the stepping outside

13
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,750
of that not even close

14
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:29,319

so big advocate for the missing you I
love you guys this is a phenomenal

16
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:44,329
community we do a lot of cool stuff
involved with Kirk on involved with

17
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:50,810
converge the b-sides conference my
psycho wasps fantastic group of people

18
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm so glad to be here I'm classically
trained as a developer which is a lot

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,909
like classically trained as a penis
which means no one piece me I was

20
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:04,530
originally gonna be a developer in and
then I let some depth teams for a while

21
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,459
on a lot of fun with it I still love
code but don't get to write it very

22
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,370
often I'm a strategist at CBI our work
with very senior security leaders to

23
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,090
define strategies solve some problems
and they were very junior folks with my

24
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,909
CBI can be my teams here

25
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:27,129
green the next generation hackers to to
solve these problems

26
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:30,819
talk too much had to be too much a blog
too much do videos

27
00:03:30,819 --> 00:05:02,610
talking about my life at forty Business
Analyst ahead

28
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,900
the setup it's the nerdy pig in the big
bad wolf give you one guess who the wolf

29
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,990
is we are going to go hey here's how tax
would happen right this is a one on one

30
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,180
application pen testing suffer some you
guys are so many other people and that's

31
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,120
that's how they do it yes they do it
don't talk button and it will turn it

32
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:50,650
over to you what I'll do a developer
they have all these are all principles

33
00:05:50,650 --> 00:06:02,259
can he live with that let's break some
apps of course the very first thing as

34
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:06,189
the big bad wolf I'm going to do is look
at your website I'm gonna look deep into

35
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,330
your soul

36
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,659
Google darkly right I love Google dorky
you would be amazed at the amount of

37
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:16,139
staff from Google dark until he gets
whether keywords passwords whatever

38
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,169
business processes following what's on
your mind who's the executive swimming

39
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:26,900
in a fish what are the names a little
pigs will start their career hit up foca

40
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:38,780
I'm gonna hit up and of course we're
gonna do Center buster

41
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:46,430
the UN in Kirsten talk about start I
love it so

42
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,930
ok they're buster will scan your server
for a whole bunch of different folders

43
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:59,419
and files right so like WTF man PHP
admin also thinks door buster has a very

44
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,259
unique user agent it is out the skated
as her buster

45
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:11,270
that's right so ok who's monitoring for
that user agent in the same if you want

46
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:21,279
to be that guy I people watch hackers
they can choose the user agents they

47
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:29,870
don't you know why some great
information on how to attack your site

48
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,360
and from there now they've got an idea
of what the website is worse than

49
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,629
keywords I can use what are some you
know pages on the thing I get an idea of

50
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,789
what you may be running I'm gonna run
per pound and I'm gonna runs a bond W W

51
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,919
scared I'm gonna basically fingerprint
the heck out of it and look for common

52
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,689
vulnerabilities and common weaknesses
ways that I

53
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:59,469
to reserve the right call the site and
from that I mean what episode is this I

54
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:04,499
know it's a wordpress site alright I
know it's got some sequel on the back is

55
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:07,659
OK again

56
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:13,610
automated tools run through Google Map
and pull out every single page that

57
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,499
sequence action on another way the big
bad walk right is a great mentor me

58
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:23,209
against you my man

59
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:29,899
cyberattacks know but the reality is
these Texas can't go on like crazy

60
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:35,180
because you know cybercrime is now an
industry that's the gutter bumpers who

61
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,699
are running DevOps teams in their sequel
scanning everything and again things we

62
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:45,029
should watch for same thing with WP scan
all I have a long ass time I read my

63
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:52,050
blog shark tank and I had wp admin page
on I loved watching people run derby

64
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,580
piece is correct

65
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,390
so we run these things will get some
great insight and then we can go ahead

66
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,260
and get into the next step now meanwhile
the little pigs got some opportunity to

67
00:09:05,260 --> 00:10:15,610
catch me got smarter to respond to this
they are looking for places and do a

68
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:36,850
video stop in new video but you don't
know you know there was an abnormal

69
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:57,080
condition so conditioned there's a
number for a little so single injection

70
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,259
I'm running against you as create a
whole bunch of papon airs

71
00:11:02,259 --> 00:12:50,689
that you should be bought and then the
other concern and yes so i lovez doctors

72
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:55,509
and I love it when it's all log
centrally and I love it when it's all

73
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,840
luck centrally to I don't know

74
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,780
endeared hypothetically Logan strongest
set up with Deepak reds or all better

75
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,640
Active Directory integrated where we can
run responder get democrats login

76
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,760
oftentimes we log in to that same as the
bad guy now get access to a comedy

77
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:23,180
writer not go through so definitely be
very careful with what's likely that's

78
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,470
not only internally that's also whenever
you considering sending out to a third

79
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,740
party right men Security Services NISS
ship out on this very sensitive data out

80
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,070
about how did someone type in the social
security number in Iraq not logged it

81
00:13:38,070 --> 00:14:09,050
now put it in my database now shifted
out across the network where once you

82
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:37,340
see table and then multiply and this is
basic is tied to your risk Ray Rice off

83
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,060
I see this I know the risk of acts upon
a certain multiplier so that that read

84
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,450
all of it right so you think about
circuit breaker in 125 watts I want to

85
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,220
make sure that I break through the 25
rocks quicker from seeing a bunch of

86
00:14:51,220 --> 00:15:09,830
sequence so what is basically eat I'm
here and what you do

87
00:15:09,830 --> 00:16:04,130
and their application user so that they
put in some extra points for he's

88
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:18,220
basically comes down to try based
security right we wants to slow down the

89
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,960
big dad wore long enough that the pics
have a chance to detect a response or or

90
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:33,980
won't slow me down long enough that I go
on time-based security here what

91
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,690
is next so from some recount assuming
that you don't get those things and just

92
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:48,210
cooking up a full details I know that
baby ronnie is not a sequel going on and

93
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,800
I can start poking all the normal attack
tool right I can throw in bourbon I can

94
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,910
start looking for sequence action
actually I really love sequin jacket my

95
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,750
my daughter I'm so proud of her she's
not fifty but their first attempt at an

96
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,880
airplane the city outs

97
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,520
to you a consult gas tank you should
their first CD up at 10 and she won a

98
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,020
whole bunch of points at doing a
sequence action attack right by kid

99
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,420
shows the next issue as you know I'm
kinda sad I want to get a bracelet to

100
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,220
celebrate winning back that's awesome I
kept going to all these sites and typing

101
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:34,770
intense I could order it in the site
crashed what's a 500 well honey feature

102
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:41,300
for pen testing sequence actions every
right to the default sequin Jackson had

103
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,990
an admin page works nine times out of
ten you mentioned you actually had a

104
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:54,390
seatbelt like one of the first things
you got into that they hope to get in

105
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:04,170
there are some recounts the big bad wolf
I found my little pig I've now done seek

106
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:38,260
injunction on his website and add insult
to injury I post big developers should

107
00:18:38,260 --> 00:19:04,450
not only going to be he also noticed

108
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:50,290
and weighs patients typically focus on
what people think that it's not all

109
00:19:50,290 --> 00:20:14,300
texts are related to the relations so
they're not yet based on the real object

110
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,290
relations

111
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:54,990
map actually and to do that ever happens
when I get the next flight the next lies

112
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,270
the pitch operable right I'm gonna just
hold on for one second

113
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,550
so we're practicing with coffee shop I
was at Sara Khan

114
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:10,140
yesterday resigning 30 cultural much
2010 things I presented on was I still

115
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,950
see saw you know it to Google Images as
one would I clicked on reuse as one

116
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,810
would defile the licensing because I'm
upstanding

117
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,100
Google suffered moment you know big
pictures and first row 3 over I'm like

118
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,710
oh my god has caused sequence action I'm
using that one that's great that such as

119
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,220
Sony Music

120
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:40,310
the solution to sequence action right as
I can almost never fuck up yeah I bet

121
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,580
you could use you can't and I told the
story about like you know it's

122
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,690
everywhere you go

123
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:52,020
yeah well I have a Google that shit type
sedan Google that and there's a sequence

124
00:21:52,020 --> 00:23:11,840
action was I think that was in the third
row HUL will enable are they

125
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:27,549
the login form he goes ahead he finds it
fixes it

126
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,789
which again has a pen tester is one of
my favorite things

127
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:35,610
hello client I found these three things
are going great I will text these two

128
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,960
things I say fantastic I'll be back in
six months six months goes by I say hey

129
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,980
I found three things next three things
no these are three new things right

130
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,739
because every time you give someone a
list of patches nope I just those

131
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:54,580
patches but don't keep up on patches the
problems recur every time we say this

132
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,009
login page is bad and developers I will
fix the login page and satisfy the

133
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,169
security guards

134
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:07,220
get in again I liked your point about
whenever there's a vulnerability found

135
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,539
it is a triggering a bank for cocoa
trees right whenever there is a bond

136
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:18,009
trader you want to look at the overall
system however we have on the boat is we

137
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,440
should still go through that says hey
what is underlying conditions and our

138
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,299
security program that allows farmers to
exist so we don't fix the underlying

139
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:36,080
conditions it's just a matter of the
next house buying the next 10 years that

140
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:55,970
because

141
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:02,840
so now as we're doing sequin Jackson
were still poking around the login form

142
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,850
no longer works are but we're creating
cares right whenever there's areas that

143
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,650
gives an opportunity to get some insight
especially if there's no secret pirate

144
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,790
ship hundred other pages are giving us
some valuable data back I had someone

145
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,730
argues that had security through
obscurity if you disable those

146
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,830
I'll take security through obscurity
fits the back because you'd be amazed

147
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:31,030
that the stuff you get out of HDPE pipe
under their this Tweet him out and I

148
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,530
love the sweet discuss ok this is why
you don't print your stack traces it

149
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:41,190
might contain this is a real world 500
from Andy 5 cracker I wonder what that

150
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,910
page does second line down there are the
credentials to connect to the database

151
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:56,660
that's the big bad wolf is happy so
we're gonna poke at these five hundred

152
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,180
and we're gonna get a sense of how the
code works were gonna poke at these five

153
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,050
hundreds and we're gonna get some areas
back in the page weird sense of the

154
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,990
structure of the database that combined
with cool and some of the tour's I

155
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,880
mention that allow us to understand what
the business logic is this application

156
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,850
will give us enough Intel to rate a
mental model what it looks like we're

157
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,460
doing sequence action snap alignright
target it

158
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:26,690
using Matt will map the database dump
the user tables through some hashes this

159
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,830
is another one I love in a tux
developers

160
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,420
my passwords are safe

161
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:38,920
their hash and I'm sorry there cryptid
right there gripped it with a deep I

162
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,860
know they're they're encrypt it that's
fantastic look even figure out what this

163
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:52,810
is so often times obviously if you're in
the biz you can take a look at something

164
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,880
very quickly go all that's a that's a
sharp one hash even if you're not it's a

165
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,330
two second thing to run something that's
how I D right in at LZR the show on its

166
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:09,290
problematical that a bit so I don't as
the big bad wolves that hash from the

167
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,590
crowds I run through hash idk as I don't
recognize it and tell me what the

168
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,520
password is rock station two seconds I
forgot password so now I don't have to

169
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,370
use sequins action on the login form of
you seek injection drug users can log in

170
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:57,650
and I i just so you should be able to
see that you should be able to see a

171
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:41,090
normal and you know when you have a GET
request one cannot stop you sorry one

172
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,020
other thing I want to say about this
right

173
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,830
so these three miles we've talked about
30 miles being a living document every

174
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,390
time there's a new tack tack are
organizations or attacking others that

175
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,260
were investigating or read about how his
threat miles become our way of

176
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,220
understanding the world our way of
understanding how the criminals are

177
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,730
moving through the network through the
application this drives logging

178
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,620
describes a lot of our activities I used
to talk about schrödinger's log writes

179
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,550
off on doing for an sex I don't know how
I get in and I'm gonna have way too many

180
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:21,050
logs can use or know and it never seems
to be in between as the developers like

181
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:26,390
I heard lawyers goods I'm logging every
single get requests can you tell me

182
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:34,360
where the bad guys got in or the other
one I heard you know logging as railways

183
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,400
time but I did log when the application
started and I think they stopped when

184
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,650
they're tacky this is my peres way to
make new instant response guys cry by

185
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,110
the way so look we need logs that are
somewhere in the middle somewhere in

186
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,270
that sweet spot in the way we get large
sweet spot is my time to go here's how

187
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,560
we think the criminals will move to the
network there's a few guys are bad

188
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,870
that's only two and both common way off

189
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,429
excuse me organizers can I get better
Charles

190
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:15,840
so when we were doing the start putting
that log entries in the right spots and

191
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:43,059
not like everything in that lawyer to
local what they should be lobby again

192
00:30:43,059 --> 00:31:55,660
make sure you don't have a car and
execute the past week lower tax just

193
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:23,290
check to make sure that actually

194
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:30,600
thousand thousand user counter
compromising get how this about a year

195
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,530
ago I spend way too much time on Twitter
these two stories when promised twenty

196
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,300
or forty thousand people lose their
passwords get how two sides were gonna

197
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,660
do something about it we're gonna do
instant response didn't really have a

198
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:51,380
plan to the particular war room ok I
bought that get have been amused the

199
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,060
rest of us on Twitter by emailing all
these people looked just like a phishing

200
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,920
attack at like ten o'clock in the
morning I'm seeing a catfish by get hug

201
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,650
1002 anyone see this get-up finish 10th
there's gotta be the jet folks they

202
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:17,240
email me Anoop as regular text the big
bad wolf like Statehouse

203
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,090
oh yeah I mean everyone put the code
right I love get out get has also

204
00:33:24,090 --> 00:35:22,530
appointed Google dark you write your
passwords there doesn't get out fast

205
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:52,380
ok we poss old is better so crypto why
actors go ahead and put that Alka when

206
00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:23,220
you work very hard so hard because we
got different salts reach one so you

207
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:30,250
can't just based on one side are because
we gotta work factor of order crypto

208
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,610
algorithms our online so again it's time
base security right we're just trying to

209
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:58,779
slow down the walls much slower so
what's the connection between USD

210
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:04,319
as you login right a lot times the way
we passed session state around is back

211
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:09,189
cookies are we all know that I'm sure
most guys saw Firesheep was a nominal

212
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:14,739
which is the attack that will go out
look for traffic sniffle why are people

213
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:19,469
log into Facebook grab their cookies you
could live and in person which actually

214
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,400
wasn't that fun points be someone else
and Facebook

215
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:30,569
messaging huge but so cookies right eye
rolls are in cookies are passing ideas

216
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:34,779
are cookies lots of things are cookies
that when you get out on can be modified

217
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:39,859
you can throw out their loss snaps a
proxy modifying the fly that way I might

218
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:45,319
have a response back buyer she presented
Firebug which is one of my favorite ways

219
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,260
to do it just brought into Firefox
modified on why so quiet with cookies

220
00:37:50,260 --> 00:38:00,369
the big bad wolf and changes I didn't
post

221
00:38:00,369 --> 00:39:20,800
manipulation that Welker's

222
00:39:20,800 --> 00:40:03,600
something like a ride if there's a
problem with installing them so that

223
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:21,890
first check

224
00:40:21,890 --> 00:41:08,980
sometimes these fees are logged in my
problem because we talked about you BC

225
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,470
as guests to like 99 tax attacks right
so it didn't machine right go see that

226
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,900
movie is a great movie how they defeated
ago she knew the person lines that were

227
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,430
gonna be sad narrowed to reverse its the
same basic concepts with some of these

228
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,450
weaker implementations which is
interesting that's like the deep ball

229
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:34,490
players is what it is so if you got that
no plane tax you have the ability to

230
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,950
cast are reversed it out it's a lot of
times won't spend an effort but it is

231
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:45,210
there a generic versions even if they
can reverse it out but can't modify

232
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,380
using Firebug or a proxy

233
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:58,109
some of her different tack redirects
redirects alright so I'm I'm poke around

234
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:03,109
the site I'm changing my cookies is now
fixed it and is implemented a circuit

235
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:07,380
breaker pattern which have it absolute
happens too often in this particular way

236
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,589
of storing circuit breaker at the cookie
changes one or two times are you not

237
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:20,009
going to almost immediately right so
immediately redirect be logged so I was

238
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:25,569
poking around and no longer works that
redirect to login page look at that URL

239
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:27,829
to login page

240
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:32,980
home / be question mark

241
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,900
back to the pages on

242
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,539
that's nice that's very handy I like
that I can take that redirect page now

243
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:48,010
this is like with Google right technical
and phishing attack or I could inject

244
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:53,270
some belonging I could take that login
page redirected to my own blog so that

245
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,160
they login twice or they log in and send
it back to a site to meet lots of fun

246
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,520
there and that was one thing I was
thinking about right when you're

247
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,960
fourteen your writing

248
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:13,900
precalc you were such das right on exact
that bad and I'm really myself but like

249
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:21,599
I was saying like crypto hackers had das
auto exact at bat when the 311 network

250
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,779
312 here's how the logins used to work
computer boot out exactly run Ill call

251
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:34,099
log and I D XE XA was a das beste after
logging a network capture crabs nice red

252
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:37,590
screen Walkman out where low-price
stores

253
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:48,480
know what I was quoting at fourteen I
had walked right that one time in 10 it

254
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,570
would look just like that login form
capture the crowds lol I'm sorry you

255
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,280
have any crack password and then send
them onto the regular one

256
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,770
great way to catch in a controlled
environment course but that's the exact

257
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,560
same thing with his redirect pages we
can do that attack that we're doing what

258
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,670
early nineties on the web and more and
allows us to do prompts or login we can

259
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,900
do cross-site request forgery so we can
still read that way all sorts of good

260
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,420
attacks

261
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,970
which is important because it's more
than one pic right that I've got a

262
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,430
website I know he's got his own
abilities I need to get one get one

263
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:33,809
access the rising bridge product if you
send out 10 fishing now stand ppl

264
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:40,400
organization getting in and reach it

265
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,700
so will send an email that looks like
it's coming from his brother or my

266
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:52,829
friend hey please register here click to
login and thanks to the password to the

267
00:44:52,829 --> 00:46:43,549
database suppose that it requires that
scripting be covered up and redirects

268
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:44,470
recovered

269
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:49,720
reconnaissance circuit breaker pattern
aspect oriented programming type

270
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,300
squatting deals we didn't talk too much
about that but why

271
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:59,490
ridin dirty walk when I so we covered
that combine lots of today's were

272
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:05,210
breaking in these pics and again the
important thing here is her buster only

273
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,590
one guys looking for it right a lot of
us are not doing his basic things which

274
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:17,990
is why the taxes on have due to complex
right we only have to move from the

275
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:22,960
warehouse to have a good chance of
companies that they won't hear the

276
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,270
matter you then have to me after whoever
they can get text you see how we can

277
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:32,600
just get rid of that low-level noise
when I'm much better spot and so on

278
00:47:32,600 --> 00:48:36,330
these things are talking about do that

279
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:49,430
is how it breaks down right so
developers are thinking about

280
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:54,990
abstractions but backed out of town if
you think about the last really cool how

281
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:00,090
you saw right that you read about me bc
it's usually something that we thought

282
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:14,310
the abstraction was this but
implementation was right to do that

283
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:19,980
wow a little passive aggressive now not
scared so it uses that Delta region

284
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,220
implementation in abstraction that we
find that Delta that the bad guys are

285
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:30,690
going after there's a really cool PHP
have I loved it there is no on a train

286
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:35,290
you could given developer for why
because PHP didn't cause a PHP was

287
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:43,660
really AC not character attack the PHP
just in the past on the stack so it's

288
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:49,180
those types of implementation details
that fundamental a weakness right that's

289
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,760
interesting it's the borders is the edge
cases it's the areas in the unknown that

290
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,810
attract us to be hackers that attract us
to break things in that are fun and it's

291
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:19,240
really a nine day difference between
that and developing

292
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:54,680
make sure that they make sure that when
you add about 10 years ago so like 15

293
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,180
years ago there's probably only are we
really do something about that quality

294
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:03,050
thing so this concept of having a
dedicated developer we've already went

295
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:08,090
down that write this kind of having a
developer who is responsible

296
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:13,119
we've got a model to follow let's find
those stakeholders the people are rude

297
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,350
charged up about it and let's embrace
them and give them the tools to do that

298
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:20,460
they can become as building inspectors
and look for the cam and things that the

299
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:26,150
Panthers are going after the criminals
are going after right now

300
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:32,190
so how would this work in development
lifecycle this is more my baby out

301
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:36,150
looking at security programs in
development lifecycle figuring out where

302
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:42,520
the security comes to place this is just
a very standard style as DLC

303
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,799
requirements were your building will
sprout miles you doing Architectural

304
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:49,990
Review you're doing a walkthrough and
making sure that it's secure development

305
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,359
where you doing static analysis you're
running at codon looking for the common

306
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,130
patterns right for weaknesses low-level
vulnerabilities

307
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:02,890
back to developers as their building
their fix when it moves in the

308
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:08,380
verification than you doing static and
an ongoing basis and dynamic now sOooo

309
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,690
cute website as ron is going through
your fussing at your doing sequin wrap

310
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:18,480
IWP scandals type of activities against
that site by Regina QA processes i'm

311
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,130
looking for the bombs open remediating
doing a pen testing one of the things

312
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,200
couple size of a kind of glossed over
and I hate to say this but and testing

313
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,339
is now a security stretches the right
our pen testing is phenomenal it's great

314
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:39,809
it's fine it's a key component but if
the ideas fantastical find three things

315
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:44,089
wrong I will pick Street things that
means you're a job right we've got to

316
00:52:44,089 --> 00:52:48,460
get into a program level perspective so
bring the pan testers and we have them

317
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,020
do the manual testing because a lot of
it and then we deploy it and once

318
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,869
deployed we protect with application
firewall reproductive monitoring we put

319
00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:01,760
in place the the rules to look at these
errors the circuit breaker patterns and

320
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,880
we continue doing dynamic testing
because

321
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,820
action or IM injection did exist you
know two years ago and does now right

322
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:18,410
now there's no tax these attacks on
their way into dynamics tests but tests

323
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:22,420
running in Sokoto did not find
weaknesses that all dismissed because

324
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:28,570
someone just invented right now says I'm
going allows us to take the best the

325
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:28,970
best

326
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:39,380
continuous us a program where where
would your guy I would say that involved

327
00:53:39,380 --> 00:54:31,000
but they're all you know and how about
and development what we are talking

328
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:39,320
about the algorithms used that's not
something common knowledge base

329
00:54:39,320 --> 00:55:07,470
everything I feel so I would say that

330
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:13,460
menu touched on aspect-oriented
programming talk rights aspect oriented

331
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:31,990
programming has a set of rules and so is
based on an audit and oversight function

332
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:37,320
perfect and then interact with the
Panthers helping make sense of the

333
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:49,410
issues that having an understanding
security software security developer

334
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:59,410
would not work and finally when life
cycle runs to life support when they're

335
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:06,000
in the monitoring every single time
there's a breach of UNAM back update it

336
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,790
to another code review to make sure that
they're capturing that knowledge of that

337
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,570
attack

338
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:21,240
so that's all we've got any questions

339
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:40,030
yes sir

340
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:48,040
doing testing third party accountable
you call them accountable six steps

341
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,940
ahead of that image on truck bays were
you have a contract languages says thou

342
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,350
shalt produced while to Kolkata code is
defined by minimum on the DFAC

343
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,900
side-effect testing process

344
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:15,450
so I become it starts a generous man
yesterday about

345
00:57:15,450 --> 00:58:05,330
perfect so that the sum of that mr perot
quick and I'm gonna cut it to things

346
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:09,060
engage the database admins and
developers along with the programmers

347
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,740
wine in second thing is realized that
not only when your pen tosses the ball

348
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,790
between abstraction implementation at
all so far between

349
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:22,810
person A's understanding in silo be
personalities and proud because what the

350
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,880
database guy thinks and what the problem
is the difference between those

351
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,509
vulnerable I

352
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:34,949
alright thanks a lot our contact
operations up here there are no one got

353
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:35,459
me really
