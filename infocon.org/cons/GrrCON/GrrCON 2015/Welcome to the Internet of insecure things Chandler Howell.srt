1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,750
ok so alright I'm there may be another
technical hiccup we can have I can't

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,760
think what would be off the top of my
head but the base of the end result is

3
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,690
that all price a little bit here and
there and just talk real fast to make up

4
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:45,820
so I'm Shannon Howell I work for next
somewhere network and security resellers

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,500
and consultants based out of Chicago
covered all over the place everything

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,500
east the mississippi so what I want to
do they want to talk about you know I O

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,030
T

8
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,280
it's getting more and more and more
pressing coverage and mindshare and so

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,580
kind of get us some some definitions
talk about why things are currently such

10
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,650
a mass getting some the implications of
this provides a real simple model for

11
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,259
thinking about failure modes that may
cause you to consider some things that

12
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,229
aren't fitting into a lot of the the
conversations that I've been

13
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:26,689
participating in bed I O T run very very
quickly through you know all the things

14
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:30,890
I've been at this point well documented
to come suck at the stuff and then get

15
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,909
into what we doing about it

16
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,110
to address this and ideally far along in
into the development process but also as

17
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,060
these things start showing up in our
worlds and we have to figure out what to

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,399
do about them so starting with the
Internet of Things the gardener

19
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,729
definition and these are smart devices
as we call them so it's take something

20
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,290
Jordan had put an IP on it puts a
management telemetry on it and call it I

21
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,990
O T I differentiate this little bit from
the spa I'm

22
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,890
which was what Bruce Sterling proposed
back out about ten years ago the idea of

23
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,759
objects that were or a spatially and
temporally aware and it seems like

24
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,980
that's fallen more down into things like
you know our kids might have some on

25
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,800
board

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,720
capability to keep up with with where
they are and what they're doing and

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,180
those are gonna be pretty much out of
scope for this first thing we need to

28
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,519
know is that you know these things
massive it's getting massive her I

29
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,690
decided that there should be a word so
it now has once again we're talking

30
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,610
twenty billion devices in 2020 that's a
heck of alot and

31
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,569
and where most shooting right now is
residential so this was torn down in

32
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,209
Austin got a drone Hilton IOT sniffer
start flying around and what they

33
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,549
discovered was it is like 80%
presidential which is of course a polite

34
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:55,670
way of saying we'll never be patched or
maintained so where this gets us is that

35
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,340
we've backed out all these devices out
there and security is not a concern so

36
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,799
what everybody is worried about is you
know how do I keep my unit costs down

37
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,220
and so they're doing things like using
little bit processors that can't do any

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,280
sort of meaningful crypto because it
costs five bucks but one of those on

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,799
board were a cost 25 bucks to put
someone on board and actually do

40
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,910
meaningful crypto they're trying to get
to market because right now it's a land

41
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,459
grab for market share for mindshare and
you know it doesn't matter if you've got

42
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,769
a better product something that's
already shipped it and there now

43
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,230
facto leader because you know though
they may be rolled the stuff in version

44
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,920
2.0 meanwhile you're out of business and
once again you know where they're

45
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,870
committing engineering resources around
features and functionality and in a lot

46
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,600
of these cases securities actually
viewed as a detriment because it's gonna

47
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,709
make things like immigration more
difficult so you know what God is cost

48
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,720
time-to-market features functionality
but we don't have as a result is

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,040
security maintainability or any
consideration whatsoever about the

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,269
longevity of these devices and this
stuff starts to get really interesting

51
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,480
because these life cycles are totally
mismatch

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,920
most people are placing their phones
every 12 to 18 months PCs 32 maybe five

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,810
years

54
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,810
network network gear is six to eight
tops but you gotta do you buy a new

55
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,430
refrigerator your smart refrigerator
every fifteen years probably maybe

56
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,810
longer if the thing doesn't break water
heaters HVAC stuff like that near home

57
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,750
these are all you know 12 to 13 your
devices you get out into the industrial

58
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,610
world the stuff literally designed to
help move things like locomotives big

59
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,800
diesel engines things like that they
were planned service nice for fifty

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
years or more

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,150
you go so I take Metro the commuter rail
work and I took the train cars

62
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,050
manufactured plate from the sixties or
start their role in today and the only

63
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,650
things that they were placed on those of
the parts that break and just absolutely

64
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:06,760
have to be refreshed so then it gets
worse I T and I T is not able to handle

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,199
the volume of these devices we've got to
mean basically this is what's gonna

66
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,820
drive stalled ip6 eventually I know
someone last night said it to me we're

67
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,770
talking about this

68
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,729
you know everything will just leave
behind in that and it's like that's

69
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:24,250
that's great but that kinda creates many
problems assaults for for lots of

70
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,320
reasons to keep up with these things so
you gotta find out when they're coming

71
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,570
into your environment and that's easy
issue in your house when you know you're

72
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,430
simultaneously I T person to procurement
person and everything else but you got

73
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,919
into the business and how do you know
what what devices the facilities guys

74
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,310
are putting in to better manage their
buildings you know if you're in a gold

75
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,300
building there's all kinds of

76
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,800
IP enabled stuff in there that your
prime not aware of it and they may not

77
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,039
appreciate how connected it is your
login monitor so some of these things

78
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,240
create massive amounts of telemetry are
you licensed for this stuff into you

79
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,270
know your log management solution you
know spunk is great but it's not cheap

80
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,199
and it's you know it's it's by the mag
by the Gigabyte the terabyte can you

81
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,389
handle this stuff from instant response
perspective as you think about detection

82
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,449
and so now we get into something like ok
what do we find we've got an issue with

83
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:30,349
a light bulb which one so get going to
figure out which like all but is hope

84
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:36,409
it's not obvious because there are you
know all different colors

85
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:41,569
compliance becomes another big as these
devices are generating data are they

86
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:46,789
produce information that could be used
in violation of privacy policies with

87
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:50,400
this is that considered a feature a
detriment of that device do you need to

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,940
retain the state if you're getting
telemetry off of systems that exist in a

89
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,009
plant somewhere said or systems coming
off your trucks roll in the field when

90
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:06,729
you need to to do with those you know it
can your standards handle this tough

91
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:13,719
period do you have standards in place
for things like you know insurance is

92
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:19,719
that's another fun where the stuff is
really starting to Clyde because what

93
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:24,909
you'll find is we talked to Chris talks
when I get a cyber insurance policy now

94
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:29,830
trying to him to pay off on an incident
so you know that they will come of all

95
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,710
sorts of reasons it's like I'm from
Texas and down in Houston everybody's to

96
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,789
have hurricane policies for hurricanes
will then after reading they feared out

97
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,029
the disallowed once claimed by saying
that wasn't hurricane damage those wind

98
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,759
driven rain damage so I gotta get a wind
driven rain policy and then they will

99
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,620
know that was caused by flooding did you
have flood insurance so it turns guys

100
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,310
are really really good at figuring out
how to do not let themselves be on the

101
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,870
hook for the stuff and the other big
place where the physical started really

102
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,320
collide with with the virtual world is
round losses

103
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,470
and what we're now seeing is that
lawsuits being certified to proceed for

104
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,960
salt for liability on software most most
significant i think was the Toyota

105
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,400
class-action suit around effective
software for their accelerators so

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,850
that's gonna take a few years to play
out but I think the ultimate result of

107
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,700
that maybe that at least some set of
software and I'm gonna be covered by my

108
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,740
liability requirements so then how do
these things and i was thinkin about

109
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,810
this and from a kind of a little bit
very very lightweight threat modeling

110
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:38,000
and I said they can basically fail in
one of three ways at that first level

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,669
they they can get broken so someone
breaks and they hack your toaster and a

112
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,980
new cat may be used to burn the house
down they can be leveraged so this is

113
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,350
where we get into things like the botnet
of refrigerators and coffeemakers they

114
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,980
can be used as a beachhead because they
might be very difficult to find if

115
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,870
there's no imagery out to a cloud
somewhere then it may be very difficult

116
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,640
to recognize that they're doing
something interesting and delicious and

117
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,580
most significantly they can get
exploited and this is the one that I

118
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,340
don't think nearly enough attention is
being paid to and this is really where

119
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,570
we start to see is you know this is
these things are being used against you

120
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,920
there's an old saying you know if you're
not the customer the product being sold

121
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,290
increasingly you're gonna find that
you're both and this is where we see

122
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,060
things like Samsung and LG Smart TVs you
can go out and and Google for LG Smart

123
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,340
ad program and you know they're they're
upfront about it if you buy their smart

124
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,140
TV and you use the smart features on it
they're going to collect information

125
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:45,030
used to sell targeted advertising boards
you so you know I expect this is the new

126
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:51,180
normal then we get into our parade of
horrors right all the stuff that we know

127
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,430
fails there's not a single new or
frankly particularly interesting thing

128
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,580
in here this is just people doing
software products security battle a lot

129
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,460
of these things like I said they they
skip they skimp on crypto or they just

130
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,020
don't use it you know they they assume
that all we're gonna use a binary format

131
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,120
on the wire and therefore no one looked
at about security check

132
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,630
you know they're they're not worried
about authentication they are running

133
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,920
these things in single user mode so
everything leads to complete compromise

134
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,770
of the device they don't you signed
images and a lot of cases actually fail

135
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,400
open and they call that ease of
integration so just this the stuff in

136
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,660
the car drives me nuts because it gets
in your environment and its gonna be

137
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:41,700
there for 5 10 15 20 50 years and you're
stopped and of course it's not your its

138
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,280
facilities guys fall people crappy stuff
it's your fault that you weren't able to

139
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,260
secure it so I mean we can we can run
down the list right consumer goods

140
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,850
fringes light bulbs light bulbs are
trying to pick on I don't know why but

141
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,730
smart watches

142
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,080
don't know how many people saw some guys
figured out a proof of concept for a

143
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,610
keylogger on the Apple watch soyuz that
the gyro and the 3d detection sort out

144
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,800
what your hands moving on the keyboard
and then they can infer the rest what

145
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,350
your other hand is doing medical devices
these things where the hell out of me I

146
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,730
used to work in the medical device
industry and they were they were just

147
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,390
happy it worked at all they were
thrilled if it worked at all so it's and

148
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,589
they don't seem to be doing any better
at it now the third putting wi-fi

149
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:39,370
connections on IP addresses cars
everybody's seen all this infrastructure

150
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,230
this one this one bothers me a lot
because these things are once again big

151
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,620
long lifecycle menos smart electric
meter found out and get a smart electric

152
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:57,650
meter this week so I was like you know
that there was a village suburb of

153
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,060
Chicago they put a smart water meters
late and work for crap that a problem

154
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,240
called spinning which may seem in that
they would spend up registering the rate

155
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,240
and then they would never dialed back
down to the water consumption fell off

156
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,530
massively overcharged known for their
bills turns out that this was a design

157
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,139
defect in the smart meter

158
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:19,540
so they took it back to the company that
made the company did they just spun that

159
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,160
division off into a separate business
and bankrupted it now the villages on

160
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,279
the hook for two million bucks to
replace the defective meters once again

161
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,089
these sorts of strategies I think we
will see as the marketplace starts

162
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,339
mature and shake out is that these guys
they don't care about us

163
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,619
behavior like that makes it very very
clear traffic lights bad industrial

164
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:45,429
control systems this was actually I
first encountered what we think of as I

165
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,959
O T was trying to secure factories that
were getting crushed by worms and

166
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:58,689
viruses back ten years or so ago and so
what we were doing was basically you're

167
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:03,850
walking down your firewall them off you
segment the environment such that the

168
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,299
network boundaries matched the scope of
control for risk boundaries meaning that

169
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,239
the only people who can make a decision
that might put that network at risk for

170
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,779
the people who are going to be on the
hook of something go south and what we

171
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,949
discovered was that we first just booked
it all off we still had problems that

172
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,519
bring laptops in the factory that plugin
man those are in fact things why because

173
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,699
there were 50 lines this plant and
anyone can approve it once we locked it

174
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:35,149
down to just that line so that only the
manager that line the laptop to go in

175
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,660
and take his line down not only to the
number of laptops are you going to the

176
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,179
factory go through the floor but the
number of incidents did as well and so

177
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:51,449
we were we were unable to secure their
stuff on Windows 31 2002 mottoes to in

178
00:13:51,449 --> 00:14:00,509
that plant chip shooters and so you know
we we get into this and so so the point

179
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,379
of that is that we don't have to just
give I mean it's not an option anyway

180
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,470
you know this is this is like an
isolation I was trying to come up like

181
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,819
globalization you don't fight it you
just deal with it so first thing is

182
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:18,829
and you know I think this is key don't
panic

183
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,119
the knee jerk response from some folks
I've talked to his ass like now just

184
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:28,019
just keep it out and that's not gonna
work there's there's too many people

185
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,749
making too many compelling business
cases that they have to have these

186
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,689
things and so what it comes down to is
the people who figure out how to manage

187
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:39,729
the risk associated with them
effectively or gonna get a competitive

188
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:45,619
advantage in their market and they're
gonna grow and win so when these things

189
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:51,369
are coming in return the stadium what is
your concern over having this thing get

190
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,119
broken or get to get used to

191
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:59,789
to go after something else is it is is
it could it be a beachhead you need to

192
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:03,189
worry about that how do you protect
restaurant burned from that is it gonna

193
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:07,169
be used against you in some other
mechanisms you may not even auto

194
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:12,859
especially with that data to limit or
going out to the cloud so but once again

195
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:18,179
I mean when you saw that that list of
fail there is nothing new in there I

196
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,409
didn't know we'd have to make up any
terms to list off all the bad things are

197
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:26,449
happening these devices but but you do
need to realize is that we will see

198
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:30,699
novel attacks around we'll see people
coming up with new and different ways to

199
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,019
get up to no good that we have not seen
before

200
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:38,079
especially as we look at that
intersection of physical and virtual so

201
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,619
what's the risk

202
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:43,809
align the Trustin Trustin risk
boundaries so this is where we didn't

203
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,239
things like segmentation

204
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:50,019
possibly even my car segment ation and
in some scenarios and this is gonna be a

205
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,899
lot of work especially if you don't have
good mechanisms for figuring out what's

206
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,959
on your network cuz you know one of
things is the stuff's gonna just start

207
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,109
showing up its gonna be coming in
through the back door you're not gonna

208
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:04,129
know about it

209
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,449
need to be architecting for these things
to be insecure because you know today's

210
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:14,519
latest and greatest is tomorrow's old
outdated insecure piece of crap and as

211
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,279
as the marquees mark start to make sure
we're starting to see standards come out

212
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,240
and be adopted insist on on those
standards this gonna keep you away from

213
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,570
you know probably questionable 22
sketchy bridge code and integration this

214
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,180
is going to simplify things

215
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,680
terms of forgot what the heck is going
on and then along with this is that you

216
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,950
know figure out have heard or said don't
forget how to operate without these

217
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,690
things and a lot of cases you know where
work if you have it with your fast

218
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,190
recovery business continuity teams this
is kind of a full-time job think about

219
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,010
it and so you know there and they don't
they'll care to the other nice piece of

220
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,370
it is that you know they want to know
this stuff just as much as you do

221
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,490
although maybe not the exact same set of
reasons

222
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:03,060
once again do do everything you already
knew headed to and don't act like these

223
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,170
things are special delicate snowflake
star not magic they may seem kind of

224
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,380
magical in to be very tiny but I mean in
general everything you do for

225
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,230
traditional I T traditional network
devices you do for these as well and

226
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,069
then when you're also going to as well
as we start to see standards bodies

227
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,980
emerged working groups emerged support
those if you are working with vendors

228
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,650
encourage them to to work with these
groups and comply with what's coming out

229
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,350
hold this line make sure that the cost
of everything that we're have to do is

230
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,950
security people gets accounted for in
these things cause a lot of times you

231
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:50,040
sit down like Cisco is pushing smart
lighting driven off a patio reports why

232
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,940
they're looking for any reason to switch
ports but what they never mention any of

233
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,230
this is the fact that you know it's
there still I T that goes with it there

234
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,750
is a cost per switchport just cuz it's
not you know Windows or Mac or Linux

235
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,460
machine doesn't mean that is magically
free to have that thing running on your

236
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:13,600
network and that is it thank you for
your patience and thank you for your

237
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:13,700
time
