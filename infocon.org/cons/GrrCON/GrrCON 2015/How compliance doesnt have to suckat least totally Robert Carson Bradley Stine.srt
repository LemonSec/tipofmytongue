1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,139
welcome thanks for showing up to this
Saturday morning first talked today

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,510
absolutely no clue about how compliance
doesn't have to suck at least totally

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,130
this is something we've been talking
about for the last three years the

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,519
balance in this office turns into good
intellectual debates and up with your

5
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,969
done and that's pretty much how all of
our conversations end up but what you

6
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:38,500
learned is this is Rob Carson is a
director of security for sure well

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:47,539
software sheep herder and he's the
compliance guy and this is Brad Stine

8
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,260
surprise sign is security consultancy
his pen tester and send response

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,340
think they're breaking things that he's
a hardcore security guys have had

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,870
multiple debates we've also been through
to ISO certifications 2005 in 2013 as

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,390
well as PC isolated on the compliance
battle over the last two years quite a

12
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:16,119
bit so initial implementation so this is
an incredibly active how many of you

13
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,580
guys have actually gone through an ISO
certification of compliance

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,390
certification so those that have it
painful

15
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,030
my first start off the initial
implementations cowboy boot camp you go

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,700
through it he started off pretty weak
finish boot camp a lot stronger than you

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,320
were but doesn't mean you're necessarily
a trained operator if he ever comes to

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,070
you and says we're going to surge for
three months ago this compliance done

19
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:49,990
it'll never end so one of the things
that I I find as a consultant travel

20
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,210
talked a lot of companies that are going
through this process there either trying

21
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,479
to get certification or the maintaining
the one of the biggest problem is that I

22
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,550
see is check back security versus
risk-based security mindset and

23
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,369
basically what that is

24
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,570
you know we're either trying to fill
some sort of audit check box or actually

25
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,400
in looking at risk

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,000
time that I so you're talking to some of
the other compliances you know there is

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,110
a risk management peace in their the
people don't use it gets overlooked is

28
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,940
just like yeah we got a risk-based
policy check great but are you actually

29
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,019
using it are you is that how you're
making the decisions for it what

30
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,880
security controls you actually need it
when you start talking about some of the

31
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,120
other appliances that are you need to
have good control is around a loss

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,060
prevention but what exactly does that
mean is that just a DLP solution or is

33
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,340
that a data classification that then you
can find through all your products

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,590
something like this or whatever you know
some security products you need you know

35
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,440
so it's not just a hey I've got a day
loss prevention solution it's truly is

36
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,810
on trying to protect data loss and these
are the security controls our technology

37
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,760
is dead though the security control with
my environment

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,019
the other part is the business
requirements have to be met you know i i

39
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,340
talked about compliance and its

40
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,870
you know when we're talking about it
it's it's not that's not the business

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,489
requirements

42
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,269
you know be four PCI you know we have to
do this there's there's reasons behind

43
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,129
it but it in the end of the day at the
business can't run it doesn't make the

44
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,930
widgets are the money that it does so we
don't have jobs so we have to be

45
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,489
thinking in you know very thoughtfully
about making sure that the new business

46
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:40,709
requirements are met

47
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:48,459
so I don't know how many here testers
red teamers purity people you know when

48
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,630
i when i hear the last couple
conferences and the keynotes and stuff

49
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,260
like that keeps coming up is automating
the pen testers I feel like there's a

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,140
lot of there's a lot of companies out
there that are producing quite frankly

51
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,480
shit and if we are going to deliver a
product or a report to you that is a

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,010
check box type report that services
useful when I'm doing a pen tester when

53
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm going in and trying to working with
a company you know I want to see them

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,310
through I want to see what the root
cause for example the Keno yesterday

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,780
they were talking about the patch patch
management everything else you not come

56
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,800
in a compromise a system based on Patch

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,500
you know exploit whatever the underlying
cause is not match it's a patch

58
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,570
management how did that system because
how's that system in your environment

59
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,720
still today and it's not that I come in
at six months I find a different patches

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,010
missing great that's the root cause it's
not the actual patch that is missing so

61
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,000
you know

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,490
working with the customers and an
expanding what we do i think is very

63
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,590
important to provide a service that you
know can be automated can't the you know

64
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,410
it's just something that everybody can
do for love you can do it but it's not

65
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,580
something that can just be is likely

66
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,949
alright so trained so when things spread
the pen testing so one of the things

67
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:26,009
change the right staff of what they need
so when you have a compliance standard

68
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,750
security assessment so you can check the
block and have a secure assessment to

69
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,150
come and scan ok great to tell you
something pretty much already know or

70
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,060
what I do is I hire company to come in
and do purple team train might seem

71
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,659
suddenly do the red team is a lot better
at as opposed to just checking the blog

72
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,610
that's one of the tricks to compliances
standard says it's nothing says you have

73
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,780
you can't go past that standard ok just
did you meet the standards but I so this

74
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,199
was in the other ones demands continued
improvement so trainer at staff of what

75
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,849
they need

76
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:05,629
in-person training and make it
applicable so long as passenger

77
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:10,250
corporation how feasible is understand
you know there is we do currently is

78
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,039
coming to get your initial online chain
that's great but why do the annual

79
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,639
training things like that get in front
of people talk to them talk to the

80
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,849
business understand what their needs are
making sure breaking their business

81
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:24,840
processes work with them to come with
the solution and train them on standard

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,620
and what it means removing all that
mystery about it get the good standing

83
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,800
in front of them say the use of the
closet we have to me let's figure out a

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,669
solution is in some of these compliance
standards if you'll get better and it's

85
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,839
a little more prescriptive ok so you
have to meet the compliance and business

86
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,099
silly mean exactly the way the book says
you have options there

87
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:50,900
great thing so one thing that you that I
think that the what you think about the

88
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,569
online modules go out for the sands
trainings and stuff like that the Saints

89
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,909
trainings where it's just hey do you
know how to set a password you you know

90
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:06,090
just the basic security 101 he's OK

91
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,889
I like to think in person anytime you
know this and stuff is great but I think

92
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,389
it's time you get from people and get
that face Sanderson who security is what

93
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,949
their there and they're not they're
they're force for good

94
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,400
out of Forestry will not lock them down
like it or not we are here to make money

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,919
we don't do security for finally do it
because they protect revenue make more

96
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:36,370
change management so you go to the
initial implementation searching for a

97
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,979
smaller company a lot of fun right cuz
you're gonna get your ID see manager is

98
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:48,669
great goalies changes like who cares
right well we don't have the log when we

99
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,729
can't prove what changes we made to it
also forces that check of hey you can

100
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,530
bring the system down to we tell the
users that we're going to be taking the

101
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,710
system down amazing how many times a
scene from my own staff occasionally

102
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,530
company right now but at different
companies you know doing something

103
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,950
holiday weekend think nobody's gonna be
online on notice but you always get

104
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,400
caught right to change management
organization you simply change

105
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,340
management organizations in pace liner
systems and being able to audit the

106
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,190
unauthorized configuration change you
know figure out what's going on your

107
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,800
system so you know how you made these
changes that make sense how did this

108
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,169
change get done so you can search you
know your security looking for those

109
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:37,770
vulnerabilities those anomalies that are
resistant to add to that is its

110
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,500
responder when you have your system's
basically login we know what kind of

111
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,540
configurations you have it makes life
easy

112
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,900
rate so when there are some buddies in
there and you now have a new services

113
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,949
started you've got security
configurations that have been disabled

114
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,830
the longing you know we can see that
someone has been messing with this we

115
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,810
need to investigate who you know who
will win this has been changed when you

116
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,810
don't have those things a slider or even
documented when I'm in there it's is

117
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,420
this is standard is this what you as how
you normally set up i mean configuration

118
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,180
is huge for making your our response

119
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,610
official things we didn't talk about
change management is when you're

120
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,810
implementing your standard you're
defining what change management is make

121
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,770
it simple K

122
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,750
Change Control Board have a change
control board but don't necessarily

123
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,080
restrict yourself and your recipes that
you have to have the change for the

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,900
change was there to discuss stuff but if
you can improve stuff via email to an

125
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,569
automated system we just click approve
any type of improved nothing wrong with

126
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,980
that you know get make it simple that's
one of the best things I can tell you is

127
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,830
having been through multiple
certifications in two other companies do

128
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,410
it keep it simple write down what you
actually do not what you think you

129
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,820
should be doing to start you can improve
that process later but right down the

130
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,600
simple answers right off the bat don't
make it so hard that you cant its

131
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:14,770
albatrosses bill approved the compliance
fails well fancy getting there's a lot

132
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,580
of places that compliance bills but
let's start with policies for the Sega

133
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,360
policies you know I know when I first
was working with Carson and we're going

134
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,460
to her first I say there was there is
policies that just didn't make sense

135
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,880
there was policies for policies about
policies as we're there it was

136
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,930
ridiculous at some points and on the one
writing this so why the hell am I

137
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,820
writing this make sure that your
policies have a purpose

138
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,790
make sure that they know they're clear
one of the things that I learned from

139
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,000
from cars in and I think it's a military
background is the work instruction versa

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,160
policy I think that's very important go
into the

141
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,130
so the policy high-level policy and one
of things you don't have to have a

142
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,140
policy document and SOP and work
instruction you can have a sop with a

143
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,840
policy statement right in the front so
you don't have to have this paper tiger

144
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,640
of a thousand pieces of documents you
get an update and maintain but the work

145
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,070
instruction were construction workers
are sincere screenshots but you can do

146
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,520
nothing wrong with referencing the
manual ok that can be your work

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,740
instruction that passes compliance here
is

148
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,090
here's how we do it we follow the book
and expose policies that don't make

149
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:43,290
sense I've heard about policy a passer
policy 288 pages great dissertation but

150
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,350
really what the hell can you have an
eight-page policy you know pastor policy

151
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,000
but the other things you know I know
that there's been times where you know I

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,100
think cursing himself even put a
smartphone and a tablet you know if

153
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,750
you're not allowed to have a tablet and
in an organization for that of a

154
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,680
smartphone is the same thing just a lil
bit smaller so you know make sure that

155
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:15,350
your policies make sense make sure that
they're they're like he was referring to

156
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,410
earlier that you can follow up you make
them so difficult

157
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,880
you have people like me your
organization I'm going on around them

158
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,070
I'll be stopping straight up I am that
person you know you have to make it

159
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,150
simple and they can make logical sense
or you know you're gonna have some of

160
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,400
its technical there's going to be able
to get around the security controls so

161
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,880
organization stop in what's policies
trucked in implemented this is something

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,630
that I find when I do security reviews
for a lot of companies we we've got a

163
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:54,450
system in place rates haven't touched it
since and basically what I'm talking

164
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,030
about his ears are you tuning are you
are you looking at your security

165
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,840
controls to figure out how to make more
efficient ru automating the EU

166
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,240
integrating these systems to make your
job easier or what I've seen is or what

167
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,360
I hear is we've got this security tool
is bringing so much more work I'm

168
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,340
getting tried to get notifications and
have all the time in the world to to get

169
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,880
to these ok I understand that what is
your process for reducing the false

170
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,590
positives what is your process for
identifying what what you need to be

171
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,190
looking at vs

172
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,080
you know how do we have to be silence
that are you actually doing the tuning

173
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,460
process do you have integration points
where say if I got a vulnerability

174
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,220
scanning program right and I have
high-level vulnerabilities

175
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,250
really don't need to go and send it
through three people to get it approved

176
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,540
I can just set up the open ticket to the
you know integrated so that my system

177
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,290
will automatically created ticketed I T
stuff because it and they go through the

178
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,449
change management process to get it into
a minute so you can automate is that

179
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,670
what you're not having to be that
central chokehold going forward again we

180
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,220
want to make this easy for software also
want to security officials so we have to

181
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,850
make this thing automated as we can and
just because a security technologies

182
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:19,459
implemented doesn't mean that we're
seeing my last job I had to do a

183
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:26,199
cybersecurity and your plan was great
and I had acquired one from the from my

184
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,009
predecessor and basically in it just
said that we have a strong perimeter

185
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:37,300
great I got a strong perimeter that
means nothing you know I mean let's

186
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,079
let's look at the last type of Honor
abilities here and point them out where

187
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,439
the stuff like that once you're inside
you've got to all the information no

188
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:50,470
segmentation breaks so you know
implementing these technologies you can

189
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,410
be compliant have everything there and
it doesn't mean shit if you're not

190
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:03,569
following through and trying to make
these things secure finance wins so

191
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:10,089
never happens you can trust me so one of
the things I can tell you having been

192
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,819
through these things so the difference
to me having a crap security program and

193
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:20,879
a good one is the DSS change three auto
one of our customers required us hey we

194
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,189
gotta be PCI compliant we didn't three
months why because we had a major

195
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:30,189
security program we had to 80% of it was
done for us we're twenty percent to meet

196
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:33,980
some specific PCI controls are a little
different than what we had to do a few

197
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,529
little things up a little bit
documentation to the more segmentation

198
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:38,870
we're on our way

199
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,220
compliance Lynn so they sign the
security controls if you have nothing

200
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,730
compliance is a good thing because at
least it forces you think about the

201
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,089
entire environment 11 physical security
to onboarding off for all those great

202
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:51,689
things

203
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:55,439
addressing the people and processes
security and that's where the best

204
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,689
things you know a lot of times you'll
start off with a policy that says this

205
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,939
is how you do things you may have to
roll out of control

206
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:06,059
later to enforce it the nice part of
that policies already signed off you

207
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,589
know set to get permission to enforce
the policy that you've already written

208
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:17,339
have proved too great thing about so I
so I like myself and affected him and it

209
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,050
continues improving I think it's a great
baseline foundation missed you know

210
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,559
Federer out to those those standards
what's great about them is they have

211
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,540
some more specific controls but if
you're starting price is a great place

212
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,290
to start and then add on those controls
that are specific to what you need to do

213
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,980
you know the NIST standard rate but the
great thing about ISO doesn't mean it

214
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:41,160
doesn't require you to do it isn't it
doesn't have the exact specific guidance

215
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,829
relating this does work better and
forget about fourteen character password

216
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:50,540
or some like that which is actually good
thing but you may not be mature enough

217
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:56,199
for some organizations mechanism for
budget budgets the way I built my budget

218
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,360
here's a business process

219
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,189
here's the risk here them doing to
protect that line of revenue it's not

220
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,630
based off of

221
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:11,689
well the Chinese markets well so it's
based off of what business process I'm

222
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,220
trying to protect what revenue I'm
trying to protect that's how I based my

223
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,399
budget so that's all my controls are
built and that's how I justify my budget

224
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:26,980
one of the things I advise you to
automate automate

225
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:33,200
so by a password management and soapy
management software

226
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,640
ok there's things out there

227
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,330
the idea is that you can easily track
your compliance you know every tracking

228
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,409
approval for SOP the email try to prove
that to an auditor have seen companies

229
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,630
do that horrible don't do that

230
00:17:49,630 --> 00:18:02,680
that's what I see where we're going to
go look at what point place so the next

231
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:10,020
one is how i fucked your compliance not
just as a redeemer but as maybe a system

232
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,770
admin person one of the things that I
find is socially went on during a pen

233
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,510
test is Patch's inspirations are not
verified

234
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:27,240
just because he push out a patch doesn't
mean the system took it has been

235
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,280
rebooted has you know have you checked
to see that vulnerability still exists I

236
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:40,940
still believe I still find you you'd be
surprised this is something I is all

237
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,890
over the board doesn't matter whatever
compliance your with maybe no compliance

238
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:50,530
if you don't have a mechanism to verify
that your patches in your creations have

239
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:58,250
taken your probably changes in the
environment are reviewed so I don't know

240
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:05,010
how many people do a lot of developments
admin work by Roberta snapshot right

241
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,900
after patch Tuesday I know how to unpack
server that just reapplied into my

242
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,220
environment ok so he says things that we
have to look at we have to understand

243
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,650
what the risks are for certain types of
types of configurations are changes in

244
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:26,610
the in the environment I know that as a
security person I don't have the the

245
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,170
ownership of the IIT you know the
availability of time and everything else

246
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,650
I can't always force that however you
know as cute as I need to know when

247
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,480
those changes happen so that I can add a
point maybe reproach out this those

248
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,130
patches or ensure that the regions are
right or maybe just do another skin

249
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,740
against that machine to make sure you
know they didn't open up telling her

250
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,059
some stupid defining exceptions to the
policy

251
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,259
first of all I want to say I always like
to be exceptions to the policy will know

252
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,370
that you know I started working with him
and I was like so you can either give me

253
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,990
a small box a separate account or just
going to pull off the box either way

254
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,429
doesn't matter I'm had it so how do you
want to do this and some of the tricks

255
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:22,259
to is we have those battles max right
standardized sometimes the best thing to

256
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:27,230
do is to buy the Mac release its your
Mac that you control and not their

257
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,440
personal device running corporate data
so she's the battles that you gotta have

258
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,450
to figure out what the risk point is is
it better for them to have at least your

259
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,269
Mac that you have you make sure they
have now on how someone had one company

260
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:46,149
had a board member tell me this is like
a year ago I've got a Mac I don't need

261
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:50,490
now where the action is ten years ago

262
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:57,899
best so fine exceptions I also look for
the red team engagements for your CDL

263
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:01,799
great cause they're generally relaxed
they have access to a lot of things and

264
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,470
they're they're going to get around a
lot of skating skills they just want to

265
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,529
be bothered so these are definitely
weaknesses that you're gonna have in

266
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:08,899
your environment

267
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:13,629
limiting the school going on engagement
all the time people when they discover

268
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:17,509
all these are these are are compliant
boxes this is what we have low great but

269
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,429
I'm gonna put an hour on your employee
and then just literally traverse into it

270
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:25,759
so it's one of those that hey you gotta
be careful I would include everything as

271
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,940
much as you can read it when you're
starting out I know that you don't want

272
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,269
to just throw the kitchen sink any Legos
we're gonna be compliant with everything

273
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:38,909
that makes your screen monitor you know
the nice thing is with it as a pen

274
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:43,490
tester noisy as hell and most of the
time people are looking there's very few

275
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,919
shops with his government stuff like
that that are actually looking so we

276
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:54,020
just you know monitored the tools that
you put in place

277
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:00,810
so that's why can't we just get along as
you tell we have to work together we

278
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,390
have to come together and make things
happen although as we're going to make

279
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,380
the entire thing sale and one of the
best and most important thing to

280
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,370
understand the control and don't make it
bigger than it has to be ok so figure

281
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,140
out what the control is and start simple
