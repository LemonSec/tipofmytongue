1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,009
my own interests here now you don't have
any idea why you're here you you won't

2
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:29,670
care and two minutes anyway alright well
as keeping this is this is not the talk

3

to bring your kids to you brought your
kids take kids out or you know tonya

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,920
from here on out cuz I am sure this
isn't the first talk that somebody's

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,559
going to say fuck in but it is in fact
my mission to save more than anyone else

6
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:56,300
ok so who the fuck am I am Dunkin Donuts
exchange student from Deutschland thank

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:06,470
you I've been in InfoSec for 15 years I
T 44 a little more than 20 and I'm sick

8
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,450
of all of you doing here on that's my
talk I'm going to talk about how your

9
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:21,740
bad here job and if you think I am using
online you have some homework ok so by

10
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:32,850
the way right just a PSA alright let's
get this started

11
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:40,560
damn straight it is so I've been in
information security for 15 years I just

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,550
said that

13
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,330
scorecard information security

14
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,410
raise your hand if you know what the
Triad is so much to shout out what the

15
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:03,980
triads dance for Chinese described that
was amazing

16
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:12,390
now that the well that's so much more
right that's such a bitch I that's a

17
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:20,060
better answer those guys on so many
levels ok but the information security

18
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,890
CIA triad rate is confidentiality
integrity and availability

19
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,440
sex drugs and rock and roll now that was
a derby can talk you're not a derby

20
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:40,590
and I have not been to rehab but perhaps
I should go so so these are kind of the

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,010
three promises that right we're supposed
to keep for the the organizations that

22
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:52,670
that we served at the pleasure of so
confidentiality quick check how we doing

23
00:02:52,670 --> 00:03:00,710
real good like not at all so these this
is just a bar graph data lost the baby

24
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,930
and you know maybe last year wasn't the
worst year ever but is still fucking

25
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:13,280
look at all the bridges that a lot of
breaches that have been reported you

26
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,730
suspect there may be more than I do
about availability

27
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:27,740
there's optimized dee da dee da boss is
so fucking cheap now there's literally a

28
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,300
group out there called detox for Bitcoin
and they will stop D Dawson you for the

29
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,970
grand total of two Bitcoin that's how
fucking good you all are at your job

30
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:47,459
right that effectively like this is like
their lake

31
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:56,100
internet squeegee scam artists right
you're getting beat by them

32
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:04,500
how about integrity now in the stands in
the centre the CISSP and the CIA tried

33
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,960
and all that they're talking about your
ability to protect the integrity of data

34
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,500
but I think we have a different and much
bigger integrity problem within this

35
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,820
industry

36
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:30,570
yeah this is kind of a shitty thing fuck
these guys sorry we weren't good enough

37
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,100
to be man tax guess we're gonna sell too
oppressive regimes that rape torture

38
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:43,950
commit genocide that's fucking rad
Eugene Kaspersky that crazy bastard so I

39
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:53,020
but yeah unfair practices withdrawal our
own competitors actively right fake data

40
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,640
breaches as an extortion as business
model like this is all shit that's going

41
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:08,890
on in our industry that is so fucked up
so there anybody who wants to tell me

42
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,070
that they think that they're kicking
after that we're doing a good job so I

43
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:22,000
got a lot more slides to go that kick in
as you're not even employed tell me I'm

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,500
wrong

45
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:35,530
know it's I'm an asshole and I'm not
right but okay so what's the fucking

46
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:42,540
point if we're not coming through right
for not delivering what the fuck are we

47
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,590
doing here and and and it occurred to me
though right that I had to stop and

48
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,490
think about this because companies are
spending record amounts of money

49
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,710
talent is at an all-time high yes sure
there's a massive shortage but I can't

50
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,980
blame the shortage for the last round of
bullshit I just showed you right that's

51
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:07,960
too many of the wrong people in the
field in my opinion so with that being

52
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,169
the case why why do security sock why
are we fucking up why is this industry

53
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:28,110
so ineffective and I got to thinking and
I'm gonna tell you why let's start with

54
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:37,130
your deja so if you follow the sands
library ISO 27 K

55
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:43,080
there are 23 mandatory policies 27
optional policies to be deployed under

56
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,970
ISO that's fifty security policies

57
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:54,410
averaging somewhere in the forty
eight-page range your employees never

58
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,320
fucking read it

59
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,630
you read it just the once a year you
have to read it when you have to update

60
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:12,540
it so that the auditors like it tell me
I'm wrong this guy hates you I hate you

61
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:19,870
too but here's the thing it's not even
your fault right because you're forced

62
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,150
into this regulation in industry
standards are fucking oppressive there

63
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,460
are months there there are two hundred
and forty-two controls in the PCI DSS

64
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:36,260
version 3 right and everybody knows full
well that lots of those controls have

65
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,870
subparts in multiple tests and then you
have to scope them so they grow

66
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,810
exponentially the same is true high
trust which is a leading framework for

67
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,170
health care and then the Cloud Security
Alliance hundred 3436 controls but by

68
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,610
the time their scope then applied right
how many individual tests are you

69
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,850
running and validating and processes
that you're following and boxes that you

70
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:10,150
are checking out a lot of shit isn't
working so let's ask that question is

71
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,260
PCI working since 2010 there have been
eight hundred and seventy-eight publicly

72
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,900
reported breaches involving PII there's
a follow-up first so for those of you

73
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,620
wondering if that includes bhi it does
not give slides coming

74
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:32,950
the top 10 breaches of the biggest jumps
of card numbers that we know of so

75
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:41,120
that's going to be primarily in the you
s all passed their rack right there they

76
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,770
were all certified they were all
compliant they all followed the

77
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,680
framework at some point a third party
who is paid to be an expert in that

78
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,020
standard vetted ehman said that they
were doing a good job within 12 months

79
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:02,839
prior to their breach you're offended by
a fact go fuck yourself over there is

80
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,300
not okay I write it was so you wanna
argue with me about this would cause

81
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,060
you're right there are four brands but
they're really three companies he would

82
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:21,329
agree I'm actually counting the ship box
you just quit troll harder bitch

83
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:25,449
anyway the fact remains that right

84
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,470
the card brands that are enforcing and
requiring this in issuing this they've

85
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:41,259
been hacked 20 shit I think we can all
agree BC I write to pick 2010 we can go

86
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,809
back and see more before the spot-kick
2010 because that was the full

87
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:56,959
implementation date for all the level
ones right so it's a mess about hip-hop

88
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:07,649
you had one job keep those records
private nobody wants to know about your

89
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,790
valtrex prescription

90
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,089
well that's not true the Chinese
government clearly wants the no budget

91
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,019
valtrex for sure

92
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,579
anyway so 1183 breaches economy is
really interesting as I got this from

93
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,179
the Public Policy Center on privacy they
have a fantastic searchable database

94
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:32,169
that you can find out all these
humiliating tracks from so 1183 reported

95
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:36,829
breaches of pH I so here's the thing you
should know about health care if you

96
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:43,449
don't already though is that cool rules
around so that's 1100 unencrypted

97
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:49,309
laptops and backup tapes and USB drives
right like that's what that shit is

98
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:53,629
eleven hundred of them didn't have an
adversary 1100 amor just sloppy and

99
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,259
careless and here's the thing

100
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:04,229
that's only half of the reporting period
right because mandatory public reporting

101
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:08,619
didn't go into place until five years
after compliance was mandated by federal

102
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:16,139
law so that 1100 that you know about
thats all since 2010 but everybody was

103
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:23,939
supposed to be fully compliant by 2004
at the absolute latest by a third of the

104
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:29,869
record stolen all occurred in eighty
three of the of the attacks were there

105
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:34,459
was a natural adversaries they were
doing we got the data took it left oh

106
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:40,239
and the enforcement body health and
human services they've been run through

107
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:48,079
so bad that they actually took their
budget for 2014 external audits of

108
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,689
healthcare providers and payers and
pulled it back into their own security

109
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:58,129
budget to fix their own shit on one hand
that's terrifying on the other hand

110
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:03,709
kudos to them for at least recognizing
they had no fucking credibility last if

111
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:09,730
they went ahead and audited other people
will hackers are still active in all

112
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,629
their shit

113
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:21,470
regulation kickin ass making a
difference i watch

114
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:28,210
Regulation and Enforcement let's turn
back to you and your shitty gazillion

115
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:34,410
pages of policy at work when was the
last time you fired somebody when was

116
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,610
the last time you pick up the phone and
called a jar and said this person put a

117
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,490
sticky note with their password on a
monitor walk them out tomorrow and it

118
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:51,470
happened and how many of your policies
have ever been used to fire somebody I

119
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,610
know you got at least 20 you probably
got about fifty you may be one the

120
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:09,050
somebody's ever been fired for price and
that's the one about porn so maybe it's

121
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:15,500
time to recognize the policy enforcement
isn't even a thing we're doing so what

122
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:26,200
do you have those policies for other
trade the auditors my favorite thought

123
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,640
is that next year will come back to go
and I'll be able to troll the sky as the

124
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,660
president you know it's fucking scary

125
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:48,660
they really that would be a huge problem
do so but forget forget the forget the

126
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:56,220
future president let's talk about my
favorite past first lady sorry wrong one

127
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:04,920
so I actually have a point here though
I'm not trying to get political although

128
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,629
it's funny right now

129
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:12,750
politics is very funny right now funny
said anyway so Secretary of State

130
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,930
Hillary Clinton has been in the news a
whole lot lately because she hosted a

131
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,990
private email server where she put all
of her email and there's a good chance

132
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,519
that she was doing some state business
email server seems like there's some

133
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,240
backup tapes though I'm missing
apparently she heard people from

134
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:38,930
healthcare and well I'm just connecting
dots that's all I do so so here's the

135
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,149
thing though is everybody's up in arms
and I've heard a lot of people from our

136
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,759
industry like go on the press and talk
about how much bullshit that is and how

137
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,019
that's inappropriate and I want you to
stop and think about how you would feel

138
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,680
if you found out that a key executive in
your company was running their own email

139
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,800
system on the side instead of yours
right but how pissed would you be right

140
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,459
if this person wasn't following the
corporate standard in using the central

141
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:06,540
email system and solution

142
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,230
the you served up to be pretty fucking
pissed you would wish you could try that

143
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:23,850
person but you can but you can't
actually not mad at hillary I'm actually

144
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:32,000
not pissed you know why this chick how
quickly everybody forgot that an easy

145
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,650
one

146
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,950
private from the Army docs the whole
state depart- setback Foreign Relations

147
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:45,160
in some circumstances over a decade

148
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,740
blame somebody who's charged with highly
sensitive negotiations for whining

149
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,720
better control and a tighter loop around
their calm but what do you want to bet

150
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,290
that there's a FIPS certification for
the mail system where the communique is

151
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,389
the Chelsea Manning ripped off right I
mean like you get it this is military

152
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,620
grade compliant which for those of you
in the military that you can laugh at

153
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,949
school but but right like should but
that's the thing right this is this

154
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:19,399
isn't this isn'ta hey where business and
we don't want to deal with regulation

155
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,069
and cost effectiveness right like this
is the military nobody budgets they just

156
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:37,290
do it so at the end of the day the
standard is broken you get it so

157
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:42,709
flattered couple of the cows I'd love to
take credit for this by the way I don't

158
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:48,290
know like if anybody else is old enough
to actually read basic or too stupid to

159
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,910
teach yourself in the next five minutes

160
00:16:52,910 --> 00:17:03,870
let me explain these go in order and go
to means go to that line number so

161
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,060
here's the thing about vulnerability
management I'm not going to tell you

162
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,830
that in the real world bad guys aren't
using exploits to pop systems and really

163
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:17,510
do really damaging shit but you you have
a failed premise here this is a lot of

164
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:23,250
time and a lot of energy and a lot of
work spent on trying to make this

165
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,810
perfect right and PCI forces a lot of
this but but Ivory industries got this

166
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:34,320
great so we're slamming in patches where
we're scanning all the things which

167
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,750
means we're probably not going over a
few of the things right the whole group

168
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:46,070
of people dedicated to make something
like this happen but they only know what

169
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:53,710
they know whether I should say they only
know the vendors know right so so an

170
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,500
interesting thing happened by the way
the MJR in the bottom there is my

171
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,200
favorite Security Commission in the
world Marcus Ranum and this is right out

172
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,560
of a paper of his entitled The the top
six stupidest security ideas there is a

173
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,420
chapter on vulnerability management
right penetrating patches is

174
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,710
fundamentally broken because straight-up
penetrate is not what the attackers to

175
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:24,270
rate if you patched everything they just
choose a new avenue oh and just because

176
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,880
you deployed all the patches who thinks
that their entire external facing

177
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,620
infrastructure right now fully patched
has 0 vulnerabilities you're retarded

178
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:52,800
in fact I'm sorry too retarded people so
funny things that happened over the last

179
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,860
year you've got you got packing team got
the text and then there was also some

180
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,980
some news about it was it was discovered
that after after a particular o'day I

181
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:12,740
think it was heart bleed came out was
made public that that the PLA right that

182
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,900
the chinese hackers whoever the hell
they are you get to the boogie man

183
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:24,720
syndrome later but they were co-opting
these exploits very quickly in turning

184
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,050
around and using them really really
quickly or it could just be the fact

185
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:37,090
that now you notify can look for and now
you see it right that's really by and

186
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,390
large that's what's happening in the
hacking chained up they paid thirty

187
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:50,390
grand for a couple of a couple of flash
exploits that would work very well and

188
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:58,280
phishing campaign or watering hole
attack right now anybody who's really

189
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,580
good at that

190
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,960
better lately that's my point great
you'd already sold this to a lot of

191
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,149
places and it's not like his research
wasn't recreate Apple so you already

192
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,399
know that there were other adversaries
by looking at hacking team we get a

193
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:18,640
chance to finally see yes this day we
went public when they got docs and all

194
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,860
of a sudden we started seeing exploits
but at the same time it's also right

195
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,909
there in the dump the day bought it from
a guy who didn't give him an exclusive

196
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:32,510
on it to everybody that drew the
conclusion that China quickly co-opted

197
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:42,090
that is in China bought it actually
probably founded by the way I love your

198
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:48,639
monthly publication UPenn testers deal
he had that thing I got like 12 more of

199
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:55,570
them but they couldn't read on the slide
i just i just pick the ones he probably

200
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:06,110
is he has a shitty job so user awareness
training right because hey if we can't

201
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:13,230
patch the servers let patch the bball
Bell ok so but has any of you ever said

202
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,440
there's no patch for stupid and they
hear users are the weak link I expected

203
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,929
way more hands the rest of you you
should be ashamed for feeling that way

204
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,529
not the cheer on necessarily but i wanna
talk about something when it comes to

205
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:33,630
security awareness training caused this
is my new favorite piece of bullshit so

206
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,429
mathematically speaking security
awareness training is never going to

207
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:40,600
work right what's what's a passing grade
right like 90% is like a really good

208
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,380
grade right what if you got 99% of the
people in your company to be so good at

209
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,820
spotting fishing that they never click
the link you got one percent your

210
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,220
company that's a foothold every time
that's right so admittedly something's

211
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:03,679
better than nothing but your fucking
that up to we're going to play a little

212
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:11,110
game called spot the fish is this a fish
or is this something that your corporate

213
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:18,279
company security awareness training
program would have sent you the headers

214
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:22,650
users don't get to see headers you can't
train them

215
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:32,020
sorry maybe you should write better
detection and prevention so how about

216
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,320
this one had two black this one out a
little so that might give you an idea is

217
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:47,290
this a real fish so so which ones the
fishing line is that the first one or

218
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:53,770
the second one of your wrong the answer
is neither the first one is a bullshit

219
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,820
training exercise in the second one is
an email sent by a vendor hired by that

220
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,030
company that requires mandatory
inclusion by employees your training

221
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,000
people did not do something that turning
around and making them do that thing

222
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:16,700
where to go I T department that's
fucking brilliant so why isn't this

223
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,850
working because we're stupid

224
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,090
this is for

225
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:30,240
follow me on Twitter for the last point
I want to make the thing I want to get

226
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,389
to

227
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:38,729
is as much fun as it is to laugh at
other people's misfortune this has a

228
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:42,820
huge negative effect on our industry and
our ability to be effective

229
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,909
gonna spend the rest of the talk talking
about this because ultimately this is

230
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:54,959
the problem we are blaming people that
are broken into by hackers and had their

231
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:58,889
day to stall right and I get that
there's two sets of victims right if

232
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:02,969
your data is ever stolen if you were one
of the people I'm fortunate enough to

233
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:07,219
come to learn that the Chinese
intelligence service now has your

234
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:15,349
military record that's a victim but so
is a p.m. right they were broken into

235
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:24,109
they have done more potentially possibly
if they weren't you know too busy with

236
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:26,140
other things

237
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,630
that we force on them

238
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,070
but so here's the thing you have to
understand everybody's been popped or

239
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,660
will be popped great stop and think
about the vertical the industry that you

240
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:45,480
work in right now think about who you
know is due date got the best they're

241
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,330
good but we learn from them every time
we hang out with them I would like to

242
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,440
work there

243
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,429
r right org and you are vertical they've
been hacked and you know it like you can

244
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:06,090
probably Google the article that talks
about their breach cause that's how it

245
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:06,720
is

246
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:16,470
work you know South America which by the
way so long as flight so but that's the

247
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,950
thing there are no sacred cows

248
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,700
and every breach has the same root cause
what do I mean by this right because you

249
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,539
know if you study these things closer
look now that was a phishing attack that

250
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:40,559
was that was a lost laptop that was you
know they used heart bleed right sequel

251
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,190
injection right so but that's not the
root cause the root causes the same

252
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:53,669
thing every time the root cause is that
all of the security resources that they

253
00:25:53,669 --> 00:26:00,899
had available to them we're looking at
the wrong thing right they were focused

254
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:04,590
on the wrong stuff and whose fault is
that

255
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:13,400
laugh it up at you

256
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:20,500
so I wanna spend a little time thinking
about this why are we blaming victim

257
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,700
organizations for getting popped why is
this thing why is there so much press

258
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,300
about this why why does everybody in
this room know who Brian Krebs as you

259
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,210
know and and and he's hardly the worst
he's probably the best in our field at

260
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,340
reporting the terrible things that
happen right but his readership is

261
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:45,120
because this is salacious and it's
interesting so why does the public love

262
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,160
the data breach the public loves data
breaches one cos hackers are amazing

263
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,810
no but really I mean by and large right
technology even though everybody has it

264
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,940
is still magic to a lot of people
especially outside of our industry right

265
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,530
I just downloaded the whole movie to the
little box in my pocket I'm gonna watch

266
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,960
it on the plane that magic now if people
knew the fog and leg baling wire duct

267
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,460
tape that was required to make those
servers like stay up and and be

268
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,990
functional and provide that service like
they had any idea what the backend

269
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:27,900
infrastructure look like they may be
horrified but but it's magic in my hand

270
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,650
but the other part of it right as the
actors aren't tangible right i cant too

271
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,750
so if somebody walks into a bank and
robs a bank what we get we get camera

272
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:44,050
footage somebody looks like me right and
you can say to yourself a look at those

273
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:50,730
jeans and and maybe he's got like a
ruptured at me like I'm in bed

274
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,500
upbringing I could probably get on
Google Maps right now look at that bank

275
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,360
and figure out you know maybe which
apartment building a trailer park that

276
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,170
dudes running back to like we all feel
like we might be able to solve that

277
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:08,620
crime because we've seen the guy and you
know that if I saw that guy come into a

278
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,470
bank I would do something

279
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:20,000
me too I believe hackers are tangible
man the fuckin ghost right I can't you

280
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,110
know we have all sorts of means but for
real right like what are hackers right I

281
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,080
like lava hoodie

282
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,630
latex gloves typing on the keyboard so
so that part of it right there an

283
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,810
interesting story in the reason that we
blame the companies that were broken

284
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,440
into his because we don't feel like
there's anybody to point that great I

285
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,640
can't explain to my mom that an army
unit in China just told her information

286
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,560
right leg and it wasn't really an army
it is really a contractor and the way we

287
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,330
do this shit to you know but that
doesn't register but she can be really

288
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,920
really mad at the company that lost her
data as they should have protected it

289
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,350
that her but the reason we do it is even
worse

290
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,470
reason we do it is we're lying to
ourselves

291
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,480
we want to focus on what they did wrong
what they missed what they should have

292
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,260
been doing better so that we can
convince ourselves that we can be good

293
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,179
enough that it won't happen to us we're
focused on the how they did it

294
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:29,820
we're focused on the mistakes were
focused on trying to grab some last

295
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,280
little shitty bitter hope that maybe if
we do all the things that won't happen

296
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:44,350
to us so we blame the victims because we
have to because what's the next thing

297
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:50,850
like a winner when a story breaks on
Friday afternoon what's the email

298
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:58,440
waiting for you on Monday afternoon so
you know the words right hey I saw this

299
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,890
story could it happen

300
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:08,800
so you have to run around you are
required to run around and figure out

301
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:15,170
what the fuck went wrong over there and
figure out whether or not those same

302
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,090
issues apply to your network as I
promise you this because I've done this

303
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:27,700
when you just send them back an email
that says yes . send they show up at

304
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:36,650
your office your CIO don't think that's
funny that's not

305
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:42,580
the answer he's paying you for but it is
the right answer the right answer is it

306
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,230
absolutely could happen to us because
the attackers don't need that one

307
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,490
vulnerability or that one stupid
operational mistake that one thing that

308
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,520
made its way to the papers which by the
way was probably wrong anyway right

309
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,920
journal like for real I have no faith in
anything I see on TV or the news anymore

310
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,130
just room having worked in security so
long that now that we're in the

311
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,240
headlines man they really fucked that
story up

312
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:21,250
looking up other stories to they are
never goes so here's the thing though is

313
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,260
a really want to talk about what the
solution is what I got a lot of shit

314
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,840
last year for late just leaving on a
bummer no but sorry man it's a bummer

315
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:38,260
when I'm gonna try and make this not so
not so fucking terrible so shaming does

316
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,570
a couple of things that really enable
some of the words and prevent some of

317
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:50,250
the best that the industry is capable of
providing shaming justifies litigation

318
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:55,030
and conceals data you've ever been
involved in a data breach you know that

319
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,700
the only thing there are more than I T
people and consultants in the room is

320
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,140
lawyers and so everything's a secret
because we don't want to get to tour

321
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,530
because we know we're gonna get suit so
we're gonna get sued and we don't want

322
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,100
to share anything they gotta figure it
all out they've got to discover all of

323
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:18,300
it and we are clearing no one because
what if it got out he answered a

324
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,690
question about what if it got out the
thing is that the mistakes aren't as

325
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,060
important anyway as it is the
information about the attackers the

326
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,880
tools the tactics what did they do so
how helpful is it for me as a security

327
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,350
person to hear that your company up
because you had something that was

328
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:42,100
vulnerable to hurt lead sitting on your
network and that's how they got in that

329
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,050
useful to me

330
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:50,590
no not really but what if I knew what
kind of day today we're after what sort

331
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,330
of tools they were using where their
infrastructure from there bob was what

332
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,600
the phishing email looked like what the
address was right what if I had all that

333
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,120
information what if everybody had all
that information what if the attacker

334
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,470
had to burn it all every time all of a
sudden we're going to price some people

335
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,070
out of the game but thats

336
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,200
did they don't have to

337
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,200
right so we've been watching kind of the
the the year of the healthcare data

338
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,240
breach unfold and then lead in 20 p.m.
season and I'm sure we're not done

339
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,000
somebody else is next

340
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,200
we'll talk about them in a minute

341
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,720
but not to shame them because that would
make me a hypocrite and I'm a piece of

342
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,179
shit but I'm not a hypocrite some
interesting is that right so why did we

343
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:43,429
have why do we have the seasonality
right cause the same thing happen to

344
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:49,899
retail two years ago right it was just
like one after another because the first

345
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:54,760
case breaks and now somebody knows what
to look for and they go looking and they

346
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,159
find it everywhere right but what if
everybody had that information as soon

347
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,830
as it happened what if they had to start
over time they don't it's cheap it's

348
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:09,419
easy and that's our fault that's on us

349
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:14,980
right who also supposed to do this I'm
pretty sure security is in your job

350
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,550
title

351
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:29,580
sharing is caring so something happened
the other day as Gurgaon was was getting

352
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:38,220
started and that is the Dow Jones media
and also Rupert Murdoch and his company

353
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:49,580
whatever they're called I forget anyway
thank you for the rest of your going I

354
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,000
don't know either

355
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,630
so they've been compromised going back
to 2012 huge infiltration potentially

356
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,880
looking at sources right but so that's
been part of the statement so they they

357
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,980
issued a letter

358
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,210
admittedly right this is like three
years of breach its not the best this is

359
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,980
kind of bad news but they came out with
a public statement but then you've got

360
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,230
the CEOs of both of these companies also
going on the press yesterday telling

361
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:26,640
people yeah we're pretty sure that this
is widespread other people need to be

362
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,460
looking for this information and we're
willing to tell you more about it if

363
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:38,240
you're in our sector and you reach out
to us privately budget that's amazing

364
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,400
a CEO it's weird that a CEO had to go on
the news and say this is this is

365
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,350
impacting other people this is not just
us these people were after a lot of

366
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,560
information from a lot of different
sources and we have a good reason to

367
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:58,380
suspect why if you might be one of them
call us and here's the thing it's not

368
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,120
that intelligence sharing doesn't happen
now what is what is what is threatened

369
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,960
tell these days it's a

370
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,510
second product it's a

371
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:20,410
so let's talk about that for a minute
just the second now I'm not saying that

372
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,510
the altar at intel has bad some of its
good some of its not but how do you know

373
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:31,680
I do know one thing I do know that
there's an actor out there that some of

374
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,440
you may know he likes to call me btw
three strikes to call them three

375
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,160
different names and that's the problem
is is that the Intel is so focused on

376
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,370
attribution that even their missing the
point

377
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,540
anybody

378
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,990
buying intel that disagrees that pay
that Intel's really solid he like all

379
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:04,930
those MDN 5 emailing you they're pretty
badass those are hard to change so

380
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:13,050
anyway that's my point is that until we
fix this aspect of our industry until we

381
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,860
get over the shame and the secrecy
around a compromise because it happened

382
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,750
to everyone and if you're sitting here
going hasn't happened to me but that's

383
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,250
going to be a bummer when you have to
come out in 2016 and talk about how you

384
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:33,710
were popped going back to 2013 yes okay
so this is our mission

385
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,099
moving forward if you want this industry
to stop sucking

386
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:42,749
it's time to start gearing up i mean she
came to hacker conference got drunk with

387
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:46,809
a few of these people told him
embarrassing stories may be worked on CT

388
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,930
Ave had some Shiite forensics challenge
shared some info

389
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,660
it's not hard it's fine should we go out
of our way we make vacations out of

390
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,329
doing this stuff so professionally as
weird as this sounds our industry needs

391
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:07,220
to move more in this direction right the
community can't just be where we go to

392
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,829
have a good time the community has got
to be turned on all the time and it's

393
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:16,290
got to be about working against the
adversary

394
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,970
compliance fuck their rules right like I
mean yeah you probably don't want to

395
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:30,040
walk into the office on Monday and open
with that I depends maybe your severance

396
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,380
package is better than mine

397
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,700
you could trigger that shit have a good
time

398
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,540
but realistically right like it's time
to stop pretending that there's a

399
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,599
framework of this asset of things that
if we just do all the perfect things

400
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,670
perfectly then would be perfect I will
not have any problems like 10 years ago

401
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,000
we could have debated about them

402
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,490
the validity of external attackers
trying to really do damage to companies

403
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:02,910
but I think there's no debate left the
adversary is real it's our job to defend

404
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:09,349
our organizations against them they
collaborate they sell information they

405
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,950
sell tools

406
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:17,240
they have a marketplace we have lots of
marketplaces so we've got to stop

407
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,720
claiming and stop talking and not
talking about them and not talking about

408
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,470
what happened to us and instead open up
as a community and begin making more

409
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,890
general sharing of information because
right now tell you this it is a haves

410
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,050
and have-nots game and there are not
very many halves in this game right now

411
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:42,010
but as I have do you know what else you
don't have you tell from all the have

412
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,290
nots because they don't have it but
they've been hit two so by being better

413
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,730
than them you're not helping them years
ago I when I was consulting i would tell

414
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:59,030
people about the you know the the joke
about the about the the the the to the

415
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:04,180
two hunters in Africa came around the
corner and there's a cheetah about ready

416
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,310
to pounce on the one guy grabs a parent
make your running shoes out of his

417
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:12,440
backpack and he throws and the other
guesses dude you cannot run a cheetah he

418
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,329
said i'm not out running it she down on
you and by customers you think that shit

419
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:22,710
was funny cuz that's it we don't have to
be perfect we have to be good enough to

420
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,819
let the business go on but just enough
that your harder target that someone

421
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:32,710
else and that shits not true anymore
either I actually feel bad about telling

422
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,349
that joke now because it turns out I was
lying I didn't know it so maybe I was

423
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:43,599
just wrong but that's the problem right
there are so many adversaries and they

424
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:53,640
are so under addressed the walls are not
high the challenge is not hard by why is

425
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,670
China famous for using fishing

426
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,210
cuz they fucking can be right leg

427
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,190
why because it works because we're still
using forty year old protocols and still

428
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,020
asking people to do stupid things on a
daily basis

429
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:16,480
a lot of work to do but it starts here
it starts with the industry has starts

430
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,859
with us trying to bring everybody up and
make everybody better that's really the

431
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:26,920
secret I need all of you to stop sucking
and her for me to help you not stop

432
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:34,980
sucking I have to admit I said not know
definitely do stop socket we have to

433
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,950
stop sucking together right because
whether I'm whether I'm actually any

434
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,890
better at this than you are not as
irrelevant as long as there's a problem

435
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:53,720
you guys are bad people you think I can
hear you but I i

436
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:10,109
pieces so ok you don't have to stop sake
or swat away love you too so anyway

437
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:16,510
well apparently this should I get the
fuck out
