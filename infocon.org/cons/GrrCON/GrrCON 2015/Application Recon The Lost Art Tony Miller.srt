1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,180
alright so we're going down to the close
of the end of the day here not quite

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,049
there yet so we all here for a talk
about application reach the lost art

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,179
my name's Tony Miller and that's why I'm
standing in front of Use I'm gonna tell

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:24,320
you all about this crazy stuff so let me
begin with why am I getting my name is

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Tony Miller I am a principal application
security engineer i think is the

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,340
official title whatever that means the
more important thing I spent 10 years as

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,930
a developer working for a large
financial services company done another

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,440
ten years and application security can
see if there are different technologies

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,850
of work with pretty much just about
anything under the Sun missing some

10
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,460
means tax stuff and other stuff done
more recently but that wasn't as a true

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,230
developers so I guess I'll include it
down here the shameless plug my twitter

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,710
handle sure some ungodly reason she
wanted to follow me or shoot me a

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,660
question whatever I'm out there feel
free

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,920
my email address as well if you guys
wanna email me questions or a man have a

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,060
buncha links in the slides so for some
reason you don't catch up and you want

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,570
to later let me know I will get you that
information finally if anybody really

17
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,070
gives a shit at all

18
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,340
down there in the bottom that's my
employer this really doesn't represent

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,410
them necessarily but in case you should
you know they're there you go I work for

20
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,450
a special security fair enough that I'm
going to see that there is talk

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,310
so let me talk a little bit about where
we're headed today as I said we're going

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,070
to talk about application recount now
let's let's sorry I know guys were all

23
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,070
these were all kinda shy nor was his
hands and shit but bear with me right up

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,770
there where are my pen testers first of
all what they're doing pen testing and

25
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,670
as a job ok I've got a few cool so a lot
of guys are gonna know already what i'm

26
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,110
talking I want to stay up recount how
many guys are developers out there and

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,369
wrestle all just do something else cool
so for the developers you gonna see this

28
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:07,259
might be a little bit a news to you
maybe not gonna take it back to how this

29
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,450
plays into a lot of things you're doing
too so we gonna talk a little bit water

30
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,290
recon is we're gonna get into Google
hacking or more commonly nowadays

31
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,599
they're calling Google Dorking will go
through some of the history real quick

32
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,450
on that but let me show you some cool
stuff how we use our friend Google to do

33
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,200
a lot of great things when it comes to
getting reconnaissance on an application

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,030
also show you how we can using DNS
records and you know a lot of times

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,840
application pen tester see no DNS well
that's for those network guys wonder why

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,239
do I care what's in DNS if I get to the
app I'm happy

37
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,340
well there's a lot of really cool stuff
we can find out from DNS it's going to

38
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,400
help us with our pen testing might even
you know point us in the direction of

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,200
our abilities

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,109
talk about how we can use social media
we love social media everybody loves to

41
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:02,100
put all their information on social
media and has a hacker trying to figure

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,079
out what you're doing in your
application man that's awesome thanks

43
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,060
for her thanks for the help I'll tell
you guys about some other sources to

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,540
will talk about how you put it together
and your test how you put it together if

45
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,630
you got software out there how you can
use this country Canadian more of a

46
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,950
defensive strategy as well I'll give you
a bunch of tools are you a whole list a

47
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,780
different tools you guys can use for
this but hopefully army was some

48
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,120
information that you can use directly on
your own so I'm gonna start with little

49
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,349
short story but before I get there so I
wouldn't talk about what happened on his

50
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,150
first you get here by a different name
some people refer to it as

51
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,010
reconnaissance some people call info
gathering some people call information

52
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,500
discovery and more recently received
this concept of open source intelligence

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,450
are also called whatever you want its
I'm going out and I'm gonna find out at

54
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,780
information about your application
without actually having even touched her

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,969
application solo in a traditional sense
if you guys are familiar with say ten

56
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,980
testing guide or you're doing network
pen test for that matter

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,289
everybody always puts it is the first
phase I'm gonna go on a recon 3 I'm

58
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,419
gonna gain all the information I can
about your appt about your network or

59
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,789
whatever it is cuz I wanna know what's
going on in there as much as I can

60
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,270
before I ever touch it so with
applications were trying to figure out

61
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,610
maybe what kind of technologies you've
gotten use what the breadth of that

62
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,830
application is things like that and
generally that's gonna be information

63
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,250
that has been provided to us know if I'm
doing it as part of my organization I'm

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,000
going on I'm testing some internal app
we have that we've developed were not

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,450
there for customers I probably know
quite a bit about that application and

66
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,979
sometimes as we're going to talk about a
little bit that leads to some

67
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,270
complacency where suddenly recon isn't
so important in our heads as we know

68
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,830
everything about that app already we
work with it day in and day out

69
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,250
for guys like me were consultants yeah
it's a little more important sometimes

70
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,310
cause maybe I don't know everything
about the app but I think even as

71
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,150
consultants we start to become
complacent and we'll talk more about

72
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,250
that generally were using publicly
accessible resources you saw Google up

73
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,090
there before we saw DNS records you see
some of the things social media that's

74
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,110
all stuff that's out there to be head
it's again that concept of open source

75
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,310
intelligence at all there for us we just
got to use it and how to find it

76
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,220
the concept that I want to stress you
that's really important is we talked

77
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,410
about it being this first base first
raises recon we're gonna go out we're

78
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,580
going to recon that's our first phase we
find out all the information and now I'm

79
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,390
just a tester a while

80
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,970
anybody who is destined to get in there
and after a few minutes to start finding

81
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,270
some stuff that doesn't make sense I
can't think of too many apps I've gotten

82
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,250
into where it got through the whole
application and looked at me all my

83
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,250
blogs or whatever and yet they're all
made sense that was that I totally

84
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,900
figured that all out just by using the
app so this concept of going back and

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,890
doing more recon after we have an idea
of what the app looks like what that

86
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,680
landscape looks like maybe we season
technology in there but we're not quite

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,660
sure how they're using or the use it
correctly so we can use recon help us

88
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,470
out there so I'm gonna tell you a little
story and this story explains why I'm

89
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,650
standing here today it was kind of my
inspiration to put this talk together in

90
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,260
the first place

91
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,440
the soul just so you know I'm not
preaching I fall into the same trip as

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,230
everybody else I said you know we as
testers we get complacent we've kind of

93
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,180
more and more we've moved away from
doing this type of recon here's my story

94
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,150
where I kind of was reminded why it was
so important so I was called by a client

95
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,890
I was asked to go in and they wanted to
test you want me to test their single

96
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,150
sign-on page now how many you guys were
in Jason street stock this morning

97
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,940
quite a few you see remember him talking
about that the scope and bringing it

98
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,510
from way out here to be down here they
literally wanted me to test the SMS page

99
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:20,690
so here we go we're gonna give you user
IDs and passwords to log in but have no

100
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,420
access to any applications and we've got
a landing page so that after you

101
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,460
successfully login it just says hey
you're successfully logged in

102
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:37,940
well okay so you can imagine right away
the list of vulnerabilities you find

103
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,420
when testing something like that don't
extend very far I think ahead they had a

104
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,250
cookie that maybe wasn't being mark
secure their weak password controls had

105
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,810
that one in there to put you on that it
was pretty lame so I'm sitting there I

106
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,220
can't release a report that's got to
find inside this is ridiculous so when

107
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,380
in doubt turn to Google

108
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,420
we love Google Google is awesome I'm
gonna use Google same alot but obviously

109
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,480
a lot of what I'm gonna talk about you
can do with us Thurs other search

110
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,860
engines to I would recommend that you
try them all they've all got different

111
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,170
capabilities different strengths and
weaknesses and definitely using all the

112
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,780
tools at your disposal will help you out
but we'll start with Google so in my

113
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,600
tests I went out to do a little bit of
Google food I eat it all searchs start

114
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,690
checking around you some things I found
in the application before I know it I

115
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,000
found all sorts of vendor documentation
for the SSO provided that they were

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,070
using

117
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,800
just available in their website you go
to the vendor this is all on the

118
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,140
client's website this random University
I was testing something in there really

119
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,900
cool so they have these optional
parameters

120
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,240
now when I log into this is all they do
is give me this URL there no parameters

121
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,730
so I will these kind of interesting
that's cool

122
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,670
redirect URI which presumably is gonna
send me somewhere after i log in this

123
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,000
service identifier which I later found
out was used to identify which

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,870
application was that you were looking
into those kinda cool I figured out from

125
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:25,270
there is the URL to the default web
admin interface as a supervisor Scott

126
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,470
web admin interface

127
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,440
oh yeah by the way it has a set of the
full credits lol obviously get

128
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,940
interesting

129
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,450
el sabado through some more Google
hacking

130
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,020
URLs for number the client applications
are out there so I found out he you know

131
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,830
we've got these these two parameters
here and I don't have the names up there

132
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,320
because they would actually uniquely
identify the provider and i dont wanna

133
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,770
do that but that's exactly how I started
finding these URLs was just a simple

134
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,030
search and you'll see how we do it a few
minutes just looking for those

135
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:05,560
parameters in specific URLs and finally
a listing service identifiers as well i

136
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,890
mean great stuff all of it out there

137
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:14,980
public domain easy for me to discover so
my two page for my to finding report

138
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:22,660
suddenly went to what I say there are 16
findings stop trying so here we go now

139
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,730
I've got

140
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,830
apologize I originally was gonna have
candy

141
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,330
but like all they had left out there was
meant as I was gonna go candy for people

142
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,190
to get this but we're doing the family
thing later so we'll start now wants

143
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,450
take a guess given the information I
just gave you gotta get that one of

144
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,870
these vulnerabilities is gonna be

145
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:52,720
hired direct that's your first rake
actually open redress you said that is

146
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,490
the number one answer yes absolutely

147
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,649
first thing I see when I C A

148
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:03,220
redirect URI as a parameter holy shit
what can I do it that way I can send

149
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,069
everywhere I want and sure enough
unveiled complete one validator redirect

150
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,369
I could send you anywhere you want to go
that's cool

151
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,959
other thoughts all the things I talked
about what would be vulnerabilities I

152
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:20,759
found out there yes and yes you guys are
together so it's two and three see you

153
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:26,639
guys are right down the list so yes I
found that sure enough this brilliant

154
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,149
educational institution where I presume
lots of people center find children to

155
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:38,069
become smart had the web admin interface
exposed to the Internet

156
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:45,629
damage what are we doing worse yet that
wasn't enough we really just wanted to

157
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:51,259
screw ourselves over good we need to
change any of the threads on their web

158
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:57,860
admin interface so sure no default Reds
not my guests to be fair is that nobody

159
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,869
realized this thing even exist because
by default install you throw the

160
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:05,870
webserver alternate hey it was just
available and if you did make a

161
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,699
concerted effort to change your schedule
here they're there for you to write any

162
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,550
other thoughts

163
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,300
the other two maybe not so obvious

164
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,730
all given to you because well they're
not as obvious when I gave you cross

165
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,260
site scripting so when I was no longer
landing on that cool little page they

166
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,340
put together for me but now realized I
could send these parameters and kind of

167
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,670
just how it responded to me I got to
another page which was kinda like de

168
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,030
intermediate hey you've logged in an
hour on redirect you somewhere else page

169
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,410
well that murder redirect you to this
service that you provided us boom

170
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,230
cross-site scripting think you have a
good nice day also want to get into that

171
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,250
admin site

172
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:58,930
well yet see surf beautiful so now not
only even if we change the default Reds

173
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,340
hey maybe I fish one-year Edmonds or
somebody on the system and there's all

174
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,170
sorts of fun stuff

175
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,860
changing people's profiles so the point
of all this is this was my reminder

176
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,230
right so I took this happened I okay
that claim providing information i'm

177
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,690
looking at man this is a tiny little
scope I'm gonna do with this has nothing

178
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,280
to do I took for granted that I had all
the information I need it when I

179
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,390
realized I wasn't gonna get anything in
this kind of went back to basics which

180
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:33,860
is the whole point of this talk alright
so what do we do well man if I go back

181
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,440
and I do some recon

182
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,170
suddenly not so far more impressive
report then a cookie finding and oh yeah

183
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:50,850
your password policy sucks alright so
that brings us to where we are today so

184
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,000
jumping right into this one to start off
with this idea of Google hacking know

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,550
anybody heard and Google hacking Google
Dorking that terms also will you do if

186
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,470
you are you also so for some of this
might be review maybe I'm gonna give you

187
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,700
some new material that you hadn't used
before some ways you thought before but

188
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,000
for those who are familiar with it

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,080
Google Google Dorking is just using
advanced features in Google that exists

190
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,800
today some of them documented some of
them not so much to do really advanced

191
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,040
in deep searches Google catalogs the
freakin world everything's in there so

192
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,600
what's making you so that many you might
recognize the name Johnny Law

193
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,290
back 2008 he wrote a book and presented
on this idea

194
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:50,720
black there is one of those biggest
10002 second edition I think second

195
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,490
edition of 2010 so it's still cold but
it still works all this stuff still

196
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,160
worse couple tools came out

197
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,600
site digger is still available we'll
talk more about it later it's had its

198
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,000
issues because originally used Google
API using Google found out what they

199
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,170
were doing and using the API Google is
real happy about that people started

200
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,899
using it to things like Facebook

201
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:23,790
started finding some very interesting
surprisingly easy attacks against

202
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,240
Facebook using Google hacking out there
now and we'll talk more about it later

203
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,199
again is this Google hacking database
I'll give you a link to that one later

204
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,379
on if you haven't seen it before but a
collection of all the crap all these

205
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,569
Google search strings that will find you
all sorts of great information that you

206
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,069
might be interested in

207
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:51,059
types of things that we finally Google
hacking a lot files containing sensitive

208
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,009
data you'll see some examples of that
anything from passwords network

209
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,459
information you know vendor product
information okay maybe it's not so

210
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:06,139
sensitive in this particular case for me
it was vulnerable server software you'll

211
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:13,319
see how hey I want to go find you know
all this case also you will find PHP my

212
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:20,869
admin running little setup attached to
route will see that definitely you know

213
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:26,490
this whole idea of what was up your
report talking about her buster and

214
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,410
finding all these directories what if I
don't wanna bang away at that website

215
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,189
for five hours with her buster credo
bunch of noise there well what if I go

216
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,790
into Google and just use Google

217
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,439
directories I can find the
Administrative Tools all sorts of cool

218
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:44,970
stuff now we're getting into this
Internet of Things everything is

219
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,829
connected we've got cameras and washing
machines apparently I guess Jason was

220
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:52,889
talking about this morning holy crap why
do I need my washing machine connected

221
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,339
to the Internet

222
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:59,899
she is but we can find the money and
never use Google help us web service

223
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,040
endpoints that's a great one too

224
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,260
fun testing and application maybe it's
got some third-party your own API to

225
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:14,750
allow their partners in whatever great
stuff and just tons tons more so some of

226
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,949
those common operators all there's a
bunch I mean you can go out you can do a

227
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:22,150
search for Google advanced Google
operators you can get a buncha list

228
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,459
these are some of the more common ones
that you're going to see news

229
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,570
indefinitely and some of my example that
you'll see in a minute in URL really

230
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,230
simple I got a string I wanna find all
search results that have that particular

231
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:42,760
string in the URL so admin a pretty
common one site is really good if you're

232
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,850
doing a pen testing you want to tie it
down to one small site that you're

233
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,809
working on

234
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,429
does it'll make sure that all the
results come back from just that site

235
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:55,270
they entitle is kind of interesting
you're going to see where that comes in

236
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:01,790
handy in a few minutes but entitled just
looks at the title tag on your web page

237
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:07,419
you're gonna show up in the top of your
window if you're in Microsoft Windows

238
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:13,000
hey happy stuff so I can look for pages
that have that string in their title

239
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,460
this is great for identifying specific
software file type i'm looking for files

240
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,830
of a specific type so in this case a PDF
files gonna find me all PDFs on a

241
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:28,409
particular whatever meets the rest of
that search criteria there is some of

242
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,419
these also have aliases to them so
filetype you can also substitute in ext

243
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,470
for extension and will do the same
behavior and then number range this is

244
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:45,540
one that caused all sorts of heading for
Google and its been treated they keep

245
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,669
changing how they handle it so for a
while because people were using them

246
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:54,549
range to hack facebook profile ID's and
other things and they were using it to

247
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:59,779
discover credit card data and Internet
Google for a while limited two-week run

248
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:05,590
range against four-digit numbers or less
now it seems to be open again so I'm not

249
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,779
sure I'll be honest I'm not sure no
tried to find an answer I don't know if

250
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,269
they're filtering out credit card data
what they're doing but you can now again

251
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:19,159
new number and John A sixteen character
Laurel number whatever that value is so

252
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:25,369
cool stuff so take a look at some of the
things we can do this is one of my

253
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:34,080
favorites I do this probably just about
every test I dunno intitle index as you

254
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,289
can see and understand what's going on
there I think most of us do you can see

255
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,599
the search results

256
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,769
weirdoes index up shop in the title
anytime I've got directory browsing

257
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:52,639
enabled so here's the whole list and I
just thought to make it interesting

258
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:58,559
essay ok where can I find some cool
private information

259
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,169
so I just looking for people w nights at
the bottom there is a couple there are a

260
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,730
lot more now my standard disclaimer for
all of this I'm gonna show you these

261
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,899
doing the search is perfectly safe and
perfectly legal

262
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,649
clicking some of those links starts to
enter that dubious territory of me maybe

263
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:27,830
not so use it at your own risk but it's
definitely out there you can see this

264
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,090
one came back 98 results

265
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,179
you know there's obviously many other
options

266
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:41,419
this is from the Google hacking database
I'll give them credit for this one this

267
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,809
one is a Google Doc that was out there
but I liked it

268
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:51,149
entitled my PHP admin running as root

269
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:55,589
I love this one and this one rather than
this one I did actually I'll admit

270
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:00,509
there's law enforcement arm and
handcuffs at the end of the day all I

271
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,719
did was I click the one win from Google
it took me to this page I swear it into

272
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:06,650
anything past that

273
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:18,160
that's pretty wide open running as root
login so hard to see where these things

274
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,220
lead some other ones this I can imagine
this before

275
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,470
for this is how I find edmund cites a
lot of times it's a great one

276
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:34,090
just fine in the euro / admin maybe look
for login in the title so I've got my

277
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,120
admin login page this is where I start
to find WordPress loggins all the time

278
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,280
you could also do a search engine for wp
admin that helps sometimes do but I mean

279
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,100
you can see ok I've got yelled admin
logins for all sorts of cool

280
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,470
applications here in what I have to her
six thousand results

281
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,660
there's a few of them out there they're
out there to be found so maybe I'm

282
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,330
testing that as a solo page looks great
but that's all it is now putting that

283
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,820
site and safe I me admin and the URL and
login now I find that I didn't even need

284
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,880
the documentation and I could have found
it just would you will

285
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:22,350
anyone know if this is anybody ever
heard of Axis cameras

286
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,640
yeah this is cool stuff

287
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,380
alright so if I wanna go find people who
have their surveillance cameras

288
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:38,419
available on the internet could rise
people sure enough yeah these are all

289
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:42,750
cameras again I will admit to having
clicked on at least one of them in a

290
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:51,090
deserved a life she'd of their
particular facility that was interesting

291
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,330
do no harm right to know her I just died
just click the link it was there I

292
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:02,020
didn't do anything it just showed me
cameras swear so interesting stuff this

293
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,919
is restored to get in their Internet of
Things not now I have to go and I have

294
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:14,309
to figure out where the washing machine
thing is is that got me and treat this

295
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,120
is a great

296
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,940
winding down at web services became very
simple just in the title

297
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,400
looking for web service in a file type
of data has a max that's perfect on came

298
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,210
over and as you can see you know when
you get most of these are nice enough to

299
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,950
provide you a really great summary of
how their web service works I think you

300
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:46,320
British Council appreciate it that was a
really educational whether it now there

301
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,420
is a catch all of this when you start
doing this with Google Google has gotten

302
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,230
smart they know people have been doing
this you will start to see this page

303
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:01,560
after a few tries as far as I know I
haven't gotten called by the FBI yet

304
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,670
you do have to type through this it may
take a little longer it's kind of a pain

305
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:10,720
in the ass I know but you will start to
see it again I think receive google has

306
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,570
an enormous showed up at my door just
yet although you know maybe I should

307
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:22,800
check my phone but no I they are doing
everything they can to try to limit it

308
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,090
so people are scripting the stuff so
forth you understand how cool is fair

309
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,200
enough so some tools that help you do
this as I said site digger is out there

310
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,500
its last release was 2009 it does still
work they've updated enough to keep it

311
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,870
working

312
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,400
the results are hit or miss but it does
tie in with the Google hacking database

313
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,090
or at least pulls in a fair amount of
results from time to time

314
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,300
a newer one that's out there it's a
little easier

315
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,760
Bishop Fox I think I don't they bought
it or how they ended up with it but

316
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,580
ultimately search diggity this one's
really cool because it does a lot of

317
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,200
stuff with throttling so that you can
avoid detection by Google or other

318
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,230
things out there that might be watching
you may be your own internal proxies so

319
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,790
if you want to limit the noise it's
really cool to get a lot of really cool

320
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,150
features the polls graphical interface
is there really is you can tell them

321
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,750
what searches you are on the wrong you
can get a custom searches they do all

322
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,360
that great stuff for you so you can
build up your library as I have a

323
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,780
different Google dorks that you're gonna
run and firearm up based on categories

324
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,020
and so forth in these tools works really
nice have gotten both on here are some

325
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,600
of us take a look at them later we can
if we do that

326
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,110
but it's Google hacking like I said this
is all specific to Google but other

327
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,690
search engines are capable the same
things now some of them have different

328
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,480
operators the operator names have
changed but they're all capable of doing

329
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,480
it and indeed I use being use Yahoo I
use a couple because they've all got

330
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,330
their strengths and weaknesses in house
operators work great stuff when you're

331
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:09,400
trying to reconnect location and it
really doesn't take that long so moving

332
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,600
on from Google hacking I said ok let's
talk about DNS records there's a lot of

333
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:21,220
stuff to be found in DNS records it's
not just for network folks kiddos no one

334
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,720
of the biggest pains in the butt as a an
application tester is when you encounter

335
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,730
an application where I use it once and
I've got a vulnerability I come back to

336
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,850
it later to get my screenshot and what's
not doing that anymore than I tried

337
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,340
again tomorrow it's doing it again

338
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,650
a lot of times this is the cause right
here

339
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,090
well robin DNS I end up on a different
server as we all know that you know when

340
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,870
developers and organizations deploy code
they always deploy the exact same code

341
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,990
all of the boxes all the time without
fail perfectly every time right so this

342
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,870
is a really good thing if you're seeing
something like that in particular it's a

343
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:03,600
great way to find out is that what's
going on here just a good way even on

344
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,200
the way into doing a test now you know
what to expect

345
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,610
ok I'm gonna see some behavior that may
change I'm gonna see different holes

346
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,520
that are a part of this that can be
important information to know when

347
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,630
you're jumping into a test

348
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:23,800
another great thing about where is the
application hosting cloud right

349
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,600
everybody loves the cloud it's all about
the cloud our newest buzzword I should

350
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,770
have been counting today how many times
already have heard the term cloud from

351
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:37,940
folks in the vendor area being what it
is a simple search and find out where is

352
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,470
OpenBSD toward posted so I lived quick
lookup find out where it's at and

353
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,350
there's any number tools I can use role
in this case cool it's also at the

354
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,159
University of Alberta

355
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:57,820
Edmonton called up there guys again
great information especially if you're

356
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:05,099
testing on behalf of somebody else more
than once I'm gone into a pen test and

357
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,869
yes we give you all the permission of
tests blah blah blah blah blah great

358
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:13,419
wonderful and oh yeah after star testing
shit you're hosting Rackspace and you

359
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,220
didn't notify Rackspace and rack spaces
and happy cuz I didn't know this was

360
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:24,239
coming so this can be a good way to save
her but in a situation like that for

361
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:27,440
those who work inside an organization
might be helpful just to know for sure

362
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,909
that it's in a specific data center

363
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:38,509
make sure that you are you think your
ended up using more DNS here's a really

364
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,539
cool tool called suburb

365
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:47,799
some fruit is pretty much what the name
implies if I wanna brute force out a

366
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,419
bunch of the subdomains on your
particular domain I run this cool to

367
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:55,190
hear the results are running against
Google got a lot of different options I

368
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,279
just read it is the focus of a run
against Google and you can see it just

369
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:03,289
does a dictionary brute forcing of all
sorts of different subdomains you see is

370
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:07,299
just the list piles up I there's some
like a couple thousand interview go as

371
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:12,899
you can imagine but this is great too so
I'm sitting here and testing you know

372
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:19,349
WWW dot whatever dot com and it turns
out that there is also lost that

373
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:24,960
whatever dot com or austat W whatever
you know they're out there so this is a

374
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,249
great little tool keeps its silent you
can feed it your customer word lists its

375
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:40,559
awesome cool great great stuff so DNS
again it's not just for the kids in the

376
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,809
network site we use it on the apps I do
it's got good information for us it can

377
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,789
lead us to places we didn't know existed

378
00:29:49,789 --> 00:30:02,279
everybody's favorite topic social media
social media has become a phenomenal

379
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,729
tool for the pen tester I hope you
realize this is where as developers

380
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:12,399
might start to see already some
connections why this might have some

381
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,960
impact on you how many developers got
the Stack Exchange

382
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,350
working on

383
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,049
some function trying to do something and
i can understand how to get this

384
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:31,510
particular string a comeback in whatever
format I needed right that's great

385
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,770
information it has a pen tester I might
like to find so as a pen tester I happen

386
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,260
to know the developers name or maybe
through some of that Google hacking I

387
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,820
pulled the developer named her to her an
email address

388
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,140
of source somewhere maybe

389
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:54,250
hey I'm gonna head out to social media
just take a look at the MSDN forums

390
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,880
maybe the Eclipse community I can find
you out there find the questions you've

391
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,160
been asking some of those might have
little snippets of code that pertain

392
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,640
directly to the application i'm looking
at that may be cool stuff to know sweet

393
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,940
so once we start getting that kind of
inside now have gone beyond even see if

394
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,230
I can agree box test and I don't have
any code I just got an application and

395
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,720
some painful now I support your code

396
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:36,250
believe it or not LinkedIn developer
blogs Facebook even now you're getting

397
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,870
I'll admit to getting kind of desperate
when you start looking at this stuff

398
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,669
because it takes a lot of effort to find
but sometimes this can be useful just

399
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,440
looking at the status is people are
posting on their blog horse hey I'm

400
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,929
working on this or that or the other
thing and again I've connected you to

401
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,539
this organization through some way
because I found your name somewhere or

402
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,159
bbm working directly with you I've done
that

403
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,620
hey I'm gonna do a little Google stock
and bond yet find out okay I'm testing

404
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,710
Europe and find out all about you what
are you working in what are the

405
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:15,370
technologies looking for your rants
epigrams out there that can be all sorts

406
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,510
of information about what's going on in
a particular application killer stuff

407
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:25,039
sometimes even just a skills list but
look at you on LinkedIn and I can see

408
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,640
that you know I'm working on a nap I'm
not really sure based on behavior what

409
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,440
exactly technology or user using some
type of weird templating or something I

410
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,400
don't know what's going on

411
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,169
take a look at your skills list what do
you what are the things that you say

412
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:41,669
you're working on right now maybe under
your current employer you tell me all

413
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:46,789
sorts of great stuff about yeah you know
we're doing and where you are using

414
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:50,260
mustache or whatever you know all these
wonderful things that are out there are

415
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,380
great tools when I you tell me about him
I know a little bit more time looking

416
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:01,409
for what I need to be up to speed up
here's another one again we're getting

417
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:04,640
down to the bottom of the barrel things
I might check but sometimes it's good

418
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,740
information out there checking either
corporate career page or a third-party

419
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,150
job site

420
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:16,630
again are they trying to hire developers
what skills they want those developers

421
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,490
to have what kinds of things are they

422
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:28,220
exposing just threw a job posting about
their development environment does it

423
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:35,830
give me clues things that I can use
oftentimes the answer is yes

424
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:44,529
we move on beyond social media there are
other places we can look to everybody is

425
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:49,590
aware of document metadata rights how
many know first of all that things like

426
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,140
PDFs in Excel and Word docs but all
sorts of your personal information in

427
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,909
there that you don't take yourself ok
most you know this good if you didn't

428
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:04,880
know that you know it now those awesome
document generators word processor apps

429
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,029
they leave all sorts of stuff in there

430
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:11,990
Xcel puts all sorts of great information
in there and if I can go on discover

431
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,129
that you be amazing things I find user
names all the time

432
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:19,359
anybody this using Microsoft Office in a
corporate environment 99 out of a

433
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,240
hundred times are user name shows up in
that document metadata sober posting

434
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,980
Word docs to the web

435
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,700
there's a torn word they will strip that
crap out use it but will find all sorts

436
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,720
of stuff networking full MAC addresses
shop in their IP addresses sometimes we

437
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,050
forget operating system information
tells me know obviously what version of

438
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,300
the software you used which are trying
to figure out from the file anyway but

439
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,260
I'll find out more stuff about the
operating system in use that was used to

440
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,429
create that file that may or may not be
useful to me but you know it gives me

441
00:34:52,429 --> 00:35:00,780
some clues git repositories are becoming
more akin treasure trolls right now this

442
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,260
seems ridiculous right so I got to get
home

443
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,610
I can get a private repository right I
can create a repository that security

444
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:14,920
system i company whatever you would be
amazed at the amount of source code I

445
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,880
have found for applications I've tested
in ghetto in the public space now

446
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,800
they're not you know it's not bank ABC's
online banking as a repository in get up

447
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,710
no but that seemed developer maybe did
some work on a different app per your

448
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,920
put together a little library things and
has that goes to get up and then you go

449
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,440
back and look at that web app that he
was working on holy city's Union in

450
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,810
there too and I've got the code i win

451
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:54,470
sweet love it or scanning another one
that's not just for network people any

452
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,260
more kids

453
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,920
when I can find a lot of from an
application perspective we are going to

454
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,560
find some lot of times as admin tools
run on a different port right I've got

455
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,200
my website running out for 43 so where
do I put my admin tool

456
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:22,450
C 444 sometimes 8080 8081 are right so a
lot of times a quick ports can just see

457
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,590
what it does is running out there if you
see web service on other ports

458
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,570
and you can justify being in scope maybe
take a look and see what's going on out

459
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,740
there it's the same URL I just changed
the port number so they can scope to me

460
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,810
and him vendor websites I think Jason

461
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:47,900
so I mention this one this morning too
and I was so glad when they mention a

462
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,850
presentation

463
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:56,460
fender benders love to brag about who's
using their stuff go out to any he you

464
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,210
know you name it corporate software site
I mean whatever it is

465
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,560
CRM tools or you know sales force or any
of those others they all love to break

466
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,930
hey here's all these companies we have
using our stuff well that makes it

467
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:16,859
really fun because no I know what I'm
looking for

468
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,519
if I'm just looking for anybody random
to screw with that can be great

469
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:28,019
information they get a little dubious
here as we talk about the ethics of that

470
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:31,369
but sure there's some great information
for you those are some folks maybe you

471
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:41,940
want to target so much away is that we
can find information about our ads put

472
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,829
this into practice so from a black box
testing perspective this is almost a

473
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:50,559
month straight if I got a black box
testing I've been provided may be

474
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,509
nothing more than a URL if even that
I've got to basically zero information

475
00:37:55,509 --> 00:38:00,940
on this app this is oftentimes doing a
precon will be the difference between me

476
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,890
having a North finance report and me
having a stack of findings that leaves

477
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,870
them screaming and kicking this is

478
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,370
this is gonna be killer for great backs
doesn't perspective again like I

479
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:20,090
mentioned before as a consultant myself
I got complacent I talk to a lot of

480
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,840
people after I did that test the kind of
inspired this whole mess and it was

481
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,520
interesting a number of people I talked
on asking the same thing work what do

482
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,000
you do for a precon

483
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,800
what you do on your test what we can do
I don't do anything we have our kickoff

484
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,220
meeting that it tell me everything holy
crap so it's not just me so a lot of us

485
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,690
are getting complacent on this even if
they gave me tons in stacks of

486
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,540
information that they really tell me
everything did everything they tell me

487
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,110
actually have reality connected to it

488
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,560
ok how much of that stuff really is true

489
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,710
go out and verify the things you're
always gonna find things you didn't know

490
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:05,750
you gonna find things that will clue you
in two different attacks against that

491
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,310
web application so this is a great thing
to work with a developer perspective I

492
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:14,680
think so we start to see already some of
the defensive strategies you can employ

493
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,830
her first of all you can do a lot of
these same types of info gathering just

494
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:24,310
understand what it is what information
is out there in the public domain that

495
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,960
an attacker coming after your website
can use what are they going to discover

496
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,320
you go out there to have a bunch of
medidata hang in our documents that are

497
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,860
on our website what's out there these
people are going to discover and what

498
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,990
can we strip out there it might also do
you good to kind of look at yourself

499
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,460
right

500
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,720
Google yourself only people who
themselves were all veiny want to see

501
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,660
how many times I show up but operate but
now it's good stuff I mean look at

502
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,140
what's out there how much have you put
out there you know Stack Exchange MSDN

503
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,520
forums Facebook Linkedin anything else I
could be connected back to the work

504
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,470
you're doing on these applications
that's all stuff that some jerk like me

505
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,850
is gonna go out there later and try to
find so I can go and manipulate the crap

506
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:14,120
out here and that's what we do so being
aware of that using that in a defensive

507
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,330
strategy is huge

508
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:21,360
so let's talk tools I promise you guys
tools everybody loves tools tools make

509
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,930
our lives easier

510
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,700
you seen some of the things with Google
hacking you seen kind of hopefully

511
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,800
you've got some ideas now running
through your head of OG I could go

512
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,580
discover this is that with some cool
little Google dorks whilst choice and

513
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,300
tools that will help you along the way
Google hacking database I mention that

514
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,430
before this is a great resource that
exploit the be if you haven't been there

515
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,260
before I highly recommend you check it
out they have tons and tons and tons of

516
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,870
Google dorks just simple search strings
they've gotten categorize so if you

517
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:56,090
wanna go look at the Internet of Things
you wanna find specific devices go out

518
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,320
there they will give you tons of
different strains the best part is it's

519
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,440
an open community can contributed to so
if you have one of your own favorite

520
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,900
that you use you can go ahead and
contributed to the database great stuff

521
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,020
that is awesome anytime especially
you're working with a particular

522
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,650
technology and you want to go Google
hackett you go out there check it out

523
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,520
you'll probably be able to find a Google
dork that I hope you search for it how

524
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,880
many people have heard a showdown before
all that's awesome you know how many

525
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,990
times I asked that question everybody's
looking around at each other like what

526
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,970
the hell did he just say no

527
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:35,290
short and is awesome so short and is
basically the catalogue of all internet

528
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:41,570
surfers everywhere is the coolest thing
ever you want to know what servers on

529
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,660
the Internet are running a particular
version of some vulnerable software they

530
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,200
just launched today for short answer
answer short arms really good do if you

531
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,630
want to go out you just want explorer
four different crap that's on the

532
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,220
internet that shouldn't be going to show
it in great stuff for you but you can

533
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,890
search by host name so if you're testing
a particular hosting you want to find

534
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,750
out more information really quickly
really easily

535
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,210
showed in order to find that hosts you
get lots of great information they've

536
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,680
already collected for you save you some
time and she was in trouble with Google

537
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:18,230
multi goes a huge master tool that
there's some really cool stuff

538
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:23,170
moltedo does essentially the only way I
can terminate its relationship mapping

539
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:28,980
so multi-goal going out there and it
will use everything from DNS records to

540
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:35,360
meditate and files and whatever it will
map out people and hoes and applications

541
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,450
and show how they're all interconnected
within a given scope this thing is a

542
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,640
monster kicks butt so if you're really
looking out there especially from a

543
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,210
defensive perspective this is a great
tool to really see the extent to which

544
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:53,400
all these little seemingly unrelated
pieces of information suddenly creating

545
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:02,440
huge map in picture of your entire world
for any potential attacker was great so

546
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,250
more tools foca so was up here before
you mentioned as he give you a quick

547
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,100
screenshot of it focused a great
metadata gathering to go out and explore

548
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,220
metadata within multiple different types
of files that uses

549
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:23,260
search engine uses the bulls in network
info from DNS and from Aaron and so

550
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,260
forth so we'll give you a lot of
information a really good wide ranging

551
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,410
view of what's going on within a
particular website or within that

552
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,100
particular web application this one is
really slick

553
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:41,450
all graphical so it's coming it's for
those of you that really like The

554
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,980
Goonies they're all set

555
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:52,800
medical I'm trying to say this a hundred
times I can never get it out Google is

556
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,740
another one this is another medidata
tool so is similar to you

557
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:03,630
although it focuses more on the metadata
side on some of that network stuff this

558
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,760
was actually included in backtrack I
don't know if it's still there in Cali I

559
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,210
admit I didn't look but its alternate
download either way if you're not using

560
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:19,650
Kelly your distro great on Virgin
discovering metadata another graphical

561
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,200
interface it'll be altered to all sorts
of discovery for you lays it all out

562
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,580
really easy goals in the files its
search is on for things like user names

563
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,320
or other common things that might show
up in those files it's got its own

564
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,350
internal search capability that then you
can customize and have a search for

565
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:44,250
specific things specific signatures and
so forth great little tool

566
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:50,680
and then the last one for my firefox
users out there this is really cool

567
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:58,890
passive Rica as you can see from your
own appear sorry no this one this is a

568
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,520
plug-in for Firefox and it's really cool
you get into Firefox go visit the site

569
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,450
that you wanna take a look at right
click right there in your context menu

570
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:13,040
is passive recon it'll pull up DNS
records it'll pull up all sorts of

571
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,740
different metadata information
everything you want to know about that

572
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:21,150
website available with a single right
click it's really cold really slick I

573
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,300
highly recommend this one just because
it's so simple to use just while you're

574
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,840
browsing through their application
collecting Gator

575
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:35,810
doing her first steps of hacking the
website great stuff so ultimately I hope

576
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:41,410
that from this you guys but if you take
anything out here it's the importance of

577
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,990
some of this recounted what it can mean
we're trying to assess an application as

578
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:50,970
I said it became apparent to me from my
own failures in this regard and then

579
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:55,170
from talking with my peers how old
complacent we've become on this and how

580
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,250
important this can be seen some of the
examples in Google use your creativity

581
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,220
and again I'm sure as some of those
examples were up there you guys had

582
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,800
things going in your head I encourage
you to explore with it play around with

583
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,810
it see what things you can discover look
at their Google hacking database see

584
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,740
what's in there and get some ideas from
that as well

585
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,470
dig into some of these tools they're
great thing to add to your arsenal

586
