1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:01,660
my name is Martin Hsu manager my bar at
the end I gotta wrap build a great big

2
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:10,350
mo Lawal

3
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,310
later they're gonna get either we're
facing they're going to be back to get

4
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,119
through that we decided that any virus
maybe he'll gonna get on that machine

5
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,119
but we want to stop them at that machine

6
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:32,920
well some of the issues with this is
that after I get there

7
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,210
do you make it so that why that while an
antivirus no longer recognize the code

8
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,420
that I'm running when we look at a lot
of the attack that happened all of them

9
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,789
pretty much come down to be getting some
form of how worried get a half ago on to

10
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:53,930
an individual machine and that's kind of
where we're at today

11
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:07,300
today we heard yet so I'm a hacker I
want to get onto an individual machine

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,350
I'm gonna walk in delaware

13
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,780
fishing I'm gonna get on individual
laptop but Mikey my goal is to get off

14
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,980
the lab and into the rest of the King in
order to do that I need to get the key

15
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,400
and that he ends up being a published
account of any one of a number of things

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,970
to make the grower a local administrator
it could be anyone take your pick

17
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:40,880
everything that we look at whether it's
a sans target asked about it and they

18
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,970
are kind of leverage the same
methodology used the same thing and it

19
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,060
could be different people could be a
state-sponsored pack it could be some

20
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:57,170
financially sponsor looking for credit
card debt writedown we're going to try

21
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,530
and get a breach ok the breaches going
to be some way to get onto an individual

22
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,630
machine when we look at a lot of the
attacks

23
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,790
people will not necessarily Carter
breach the main target they're not going

24
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,859
to try to get the main corporate
environment they're going to look for

25
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:16,140
vendors they're gonna look for some
networks are going to look for IIS

26
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,260
server that have been stood up but are
not protected ok we're looking for some

27
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,420
way to get in and that reaches gonna be
usually on some ancillary type system

28
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,730
once we got on to that individual system
our next step is

29
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,430
Karmakar crowd we're gonna plants and
software that's up in the top corner

30
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:45,420
there when we play at software we have
multiple ways but all your resources

31
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,660
computers to do our work for some of the
smartest hikes that we've seen people of

32
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,030
actually making code and recompiled it
within your network to read attacker

33
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:02,239
network once I man I have your resources
at my back in command but ultimately

34
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,480
when I'm finding software I'm looking
for I'm looking for some way to move

35
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,239
laterally across your organization and
looking for some way to move beyond that

36
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,370
initial target I want to get that next
step and how am I gonna do that I knew

37
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,079
certain environments

38
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,139
get every single factor you think that
he once I get those credentials I'm

39
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,880
gonna do a couple different things I'm
going to number one try to use those

40
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,180
credentials on further machines ok so
maybe those credentials are only good

41
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,800
for a few machines but I'm gonna try and
use those potential number 2 I'm going

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,300
to take username password to build a
nice dictionary file and I'm going to

43
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,229
continually grow that dictionary file
with those whose main passports the next

44
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:54,960
mission pack I have a couple more counts
the machine after that I got a few more

45
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,590
like a girl my dictionary pile bigger
bigger bigger the further I get

46
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,039
environment again they're slightly
different depending on what I want to

47
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,940
get my wanna do a Windows system I'm
going to use the cats if I'm gonna go to

48
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,840
or coordinated eight so how does it work

49
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,780
let's look at our breach somebody break
I want to look at the value of the

50
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,210
target

51
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,550
what am I trying to get them getting a
credit card am I getting help her record

52
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,960
300 bucks very much anymore what do I
want to get my wanted to face our

53
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,169
website don't want to shut down their
servers what do I want to get another

54
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:47,360
German whatever hard it is important
obviously another and then we want to

55
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,780
look at what they offer based on that
I'm going to look at different schools

56
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:05,470
that I could use fishing and what some
of the scenes that I'm in a plant that

57
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:13,080
so many people per team hats for
everybody to get into more detail we can

58
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:25,810
into Kerberos to pass a half get a run
in those kind of the main ones that were

59
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:33,400
talking about this for Windows
vulnerabilities the dedication this is a

60
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,690
very old people these are like a miracle
good news why I said it all carver all

61
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,940
those kind of things are all derivatives
essentially doing the same thing we look

62
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:50,979
for these are all looking like obviously
we have a number listing packet capture

63
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,469
different ways to scan the network has a
lot of people focus on what is typically

64
00:06:55,469 --> 00:07:03,840
not the primary focus of the code that
ok everybody focuses on a network attack

65
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,460
or something I honestly believe people
are looking for help

66
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:18,720
going somewhere within the network once
they're in it's a question of how do I

67
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,199
get on value

68
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:32,620
peaceful part of a little bit more later
once I've got in my hood of launched it

69
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,639
running in your environment I'm looking
for her credential I can go ahead and

70
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,110
move further into the environment I want
to get as far as I can or also finds and

71
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:53,400
valuable data I'm gonna try to export
data what am I gonna do with it I want

72
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:01,030
to continue that tax as long as possible
before I all right there's two types of

73
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,870
attacks are still attack and there's an
attack that is deliberate and often

74
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,550
triggers if I'm a smart hacker I will
not set up as victors and I will be

75
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,550
running install you guys will see most
of the attacks that we find a cruise I

76
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:23,380
get data so I can stay in your in your
environment for about two hundred days

77
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,729
days I can stand for a while before I
actually get hot and I want to stand

78
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:39,110
still if I get a good credential that's
great if I can create an even better

79
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,919
right so I can hack your domain
controllers and I can create my own

80
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,380
credentials I can do whatever I want
whenever I want right and then

81
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:57,600
ultimately because we're computer guys
problem that I have both working along

82
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,730
with a lot of many servers as possible
so now what I'm doing is in reaching

83
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:12,310
their servers to work for me to reach
out to other servers to get further

84
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:23,580
manual process for carpal however every
once in awhile we're going to find that

85
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:33,970
there's a valuable part of their we know
has no basis in Figure has a huge data

86
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,300
store maybe a terabyte and I just want
to get that error by today as I know

87
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,620
within that area by today to their case
I get to the point that code harvard is

88
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,510
the Civic League for that machine that I
probably think might work to get done

89
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,660
she ok again most of its gonna be around
the purpose think they've been putting a

90
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,570
Wireshark on there and i no listen to
packets going to and from that right

91
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,610
inside of those packet how many people
were coded an application that needs a

92
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,200
day today you guys have an application
use region how many people put in a

93
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,500
patient's

94
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,570
within that nobody that's every time you
see a third party reaching into a day

95
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:29,820
today inside that code tickets sent
along the wire tax if I want to get a

96
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,310
database and putting that will listen to
the wire I'll see that market and I will

97
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:44,230
know what the username and password is
very easy very simple so if there's

98
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,420
something I see valuable advice he
advocated I'm gonna lost I'm gonna find

99
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,760
out you need password and I'm going to
get free and clear that if I could run

100
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,000
sequel manager on a different machine I
know the password or login with username

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,030
password and go and retrieve data put it
on your file server I gotta let us sit

102
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,160
there were few months like the rest of
your system and then

103
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,250
good I know that once I start sending a
terabyte of data across the wire every

104
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:23,129
alarming that we also want to store
information right now many people know

105
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:29,800
how long dormant will go into the
environment and display their the gears

106
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:43,709
right when the I was a fool the Iranian
nuclear rate anybody know how long or

107
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:49,029
somewhere between happier

108
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,920
who were three years but hey it was
their president and while they were

109
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,079
investigating other parts of the
environment

110
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:04,220
Verma coated the very people they don't
know where the malware didn't raise its

111
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,000
ugly head and it just ran as a service
in the background people will be able to

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:19,300
how many people have a backup from a
time and maybe we had no where did you

113
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:26,430
stand that backup tape from our very
murky waters cannot so there's instances

114
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:33,699
where we will restore from safe and will
put stuff back into our way though it

115
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,769
all comes back sending the data rate

116
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:50,209
take a little 375 question yes

117
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:53,959
frequent but you will see it
occasionally more common you will see

118
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:59,009
dormant vote so hate you have a hack but
say they actually get into your machine

119
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:04,209
and it's a silent hacker . advertising
that there there there are you'll see

120
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:09,040
them place code into various locations
that allows some of her later on OK

121
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,869
Sports more common but you will see
occasionally that code inadvertently get

122
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:17,230
back up after serving her file server
whatever it might be

123
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,579
they could stay there and Casey to come
back and obviously spent a lot of time

124
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:27,569
there any virus or a courageous enough
to get that stuff out but ultimately

125
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:31,639
there maybe legacy stuff somewhere and
you don't know what's going to hurt me

126
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:46,679
with any other but no I forgot about 15
minutes for her role as everybody knows

127
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:53,559
it all the latest ones are all using
that as you know figure heck they're all

128
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,499
using the exact same thing we're gonna
do an initial breach

129
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:03,019
gonna go ahead and ultimately what
they're going to do is planting codes

130
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:06,290
gonna get credentials to get the
credentials and they go

131
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:13,149
for voting on the top so roughly they
target they look for a few weeks

132
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:24,810
whatever their motivation was your
credit card company so they try to the

133
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:34,230
mean more targets I think could get in
and where the good writeup on it that's

134
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:45,839
her conditioning heating pad and they
need to use remote sessions into the

135
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:55,300
main artist say in order to do so what
they found in order to get in faccio

136
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,970
that's a little

137
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:07,149
individual's computer in patio and on
that computer they ran social malware ok

138
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:09,920
maybe a little maybe they'll

139
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:21,290
download their antivirus I love any
virus but at the same time that I'll

140
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,209
change so quickly I can change the
citadel code I could put salt thing I

141
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:30,230
know I can put something into suitable

142
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:40,850
lockhart 2008 leaving got into this
machine and we plan to anybody who wants

143
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,660
to go pick it up you could find us on
the internet is so big deal going to

144
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:52,459
find it is not a coder I don't care you
can see that his phone calling different

145
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,680
guys did account

146
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,270
what we'll do though as a hacker is
gonna put a list together we're gonna

147
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,930
bundle whole bunch of different pieces

148
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:11,620
little news from France reported while
standing reduced while we're gonna do it

149
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,630
all together so that one of them is
gonna work and then do whatever one

150
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,050
works we know that that's a bummer
believe that I can point and then

151
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:32,720
they're gonna put special emphasis so
anyway they planned it so that all they

152
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:49,320
got it going and not allowed us to get
access to remote vendor in that building

153
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,500
all of which had web interfaces world
based on that portal I was able to get

154
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:05,880
whatever I want I think I was my goal at
that point was I'm into the target

155
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,069
network but I'm on medical system again
I have you been some time getting an

156
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,500
account that's gonna allow me into

157
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,329
viable system and in this case the
credit cards are stored in the UN what

158
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:25,470
I'm doing is looking at remote interface
web console I want to get to the server

159
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,250
that is running out web console which
will allow me to get further into that

160
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:38,570
and able to get that credential I had to
obtain some form of privileged access in

161
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,550
this case ended up being a demain and I
we don't know for sure but we assume

162
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,350
that there was a keylogger installed on
that machine and that keylogger when

163
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:55,950
somebody logged in they got access to
see how many people know about passive

164
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:02,000
house that's everybody knows passed the
house we also know that they want and

165
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,920
ran on that server to grab perhaps
everybody knows it once I get a half an

166
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:14,440
account of the past half a golden ticket
we also know that I can you that I can

167
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,000
use it on any machine that has to meet
him an account on it that has logged in

168
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,290
and is not that half is used to go and
talk to the entire environment and at

169
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,000
that point I could go and talk to
different systems which are relevant to

170
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,190
me right maybe it's a database maybe not
but be anything but now I can extract

171
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,760
that house I have a Kerberos
vulnerability and based on that house I

172
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,350
can go to make controller if they go to
a domain controller what I'm gonna do as

173
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,780
I'm gonna create myself and I T and
that's exactly what they did go up the

174
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,000
Active Directory I create my domain in
men and what could I do want someone to

175
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,690
make dinner enterprises

176
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,149
I can do anything I want they had full
access to do anything they wanted within

177
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:06,960
the entire environment also want to know
here this is roughly approximately don't

178
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,179
know exactly but this is roughly 830 see
if you look at the county could do this

179
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:15,340
for any one of a number

180
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:21,070
typically gonna start at roughly about
day one and you're gonna have 36 is

181
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,190
gonna be roughly when they're gonna get
in there somewhere and then it basically

182
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,710
exporter 800 252 days the last 10 days
are critical because that's when they're

183
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,960
going to start doing the data extraction
and that's when all the red bike at this

184
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,880
point nobody knows what's going on yet
I'm in there I put it to me 10 min I

185
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,580
have access to everything but nobody
knows I'm in those triggers a fire over

186
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,930
everything is a legitimate access using
accounts that are allowed within the

187
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:57,780
environment so I know that the POS
system as credit cards I'm after credit

188
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:04,970
cards I want some money credit card but
it is also an hour and a POS system I

189
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:14,520
have acted to make voters and I mean
selling price drop water to cool a lot

190
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,060
of what you'll find is that hackers use
the same tools we use against us

191
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,020
gonna find tools like rats yes exact all
that kind of stuff those schools are

192
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,510
good for us but they're also good for
hackers to you

193
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,220
some of the things that I've found is
that they will actually go online on

194
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,300
your store a tool that you use hikers
were going out from you as opposed to

195
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,590
download it from the internet or
coughing it brings together so they will

196
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,850
do a search will be a dictionary search
your file servers looking for his exact

197
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,680
and then they will copy that onto a
secondary server the victim on why would

198
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,710
i try to copy over myself and i could
assume you're basically tool that is

199
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:05,160
used to going fine exploit code fairly
fairly simple interface here in V 50

200
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,760
kind of the court has been finished and
at this point we're basically clearing

201
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:18,360
up and we listened to all of it all back
or systems we'd have a domain admin

202
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,350
access this folder now where we've done
a lot of different things we're not

203
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,280
really sure at this point the POS system
talking circle of focusing on the POS

204
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,600
system you don't know whether they
created this account or whether this

205
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,720
count as existing but we know that there
was a ps1 underscore you back up sister

206
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,250
backup account of the use in that system
to copy the data back from the outlying

207
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,680
not really sure how they got that the
creditor or was existing but essentially

208
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,760
they got this account again focused on
getting some form of account setting up

209
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,060
house where they leverage is the whole
system that I can get I

210
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,530
the god they got the account they
created password either way and at that

211
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:14,520
point they aren't going to automate a
day-to-day running of the type of hacker

212
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,350
and what's happening they're gonna do a
couple different things here there's a

213
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,670
few things I could do one is going to be
copied this stuff to an internal policy

214
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:28,170
on your network to get it off the party
machine on football server in your

215
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,760
network it doesn't really good things
because file servers are very seldom

216
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,970
recognized are known as a card it's
never too often the main system and if

217
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,210
that made system does shut down I still
have my data made is invaluable partner

218
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,390
support I wanna meet then from there I
can break it into chunks and send it out

219
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,840
of network or if I wanted to wrap up my
whole high and just say I wanna be my

220
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,930
date out he will start transferring his
house as they possibly can to Brazil and

221
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,730
redirect the rougher we're gonna go I'm
going to send that data off in this case

222
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,970
yes exactly you send the data

223
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:10,640
and everybody knows it's good so
basically we're using tools that are in

224
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,690
your system

225
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:32,390
you guys already know probably go ahead
and do that they're all the same process

226
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,500
over and over and over that slightly
different tool sets slightly different

227
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,730
ways to get some hand action that is and
I talk about real quick you know I

228
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,350
didn't spend a lot of time analyzing
this I was on site or anything but

229
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:51,250
ultimately it was either a disgruntled
employee and/or someone who had access

230
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:58,659
into the system along I did a monitoring
her listening there was an interview you

231
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:02,140
gotta go and look out but they've
obviously been targeting these guys her

232
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:13,830
while nobody was watching those security
network and password for the Internet to

233
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,070
the VPN so obviously whoever set up
security for this obviously was not

234
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,400
looking at the accounts for know that
hackers typically use accounts as a

235
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,340
privilege

236
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,450
way to get into that work

237
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:33,430
same thing disgruntled employee good
access to the VPN username password

238
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:41,450
access route accounts and we're gonna

239
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:47,870
any ideas on how we're going to try to
remediate some of us are gonna fix it

240
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:55,340
thoughts over there yes sure another one

241
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:02,430
two-factor authentication anybody their
buddies who factor authentication error

242
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:08,130
per server I can we don't even carried
the first thing you want to do is 150

243
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:28,040
problem of service and I will scan very
large organizations hundred thousand

244
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,480
computers will come back to the service
accounts passwords and haven't changed

245
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,390
in 10 years is the account enabled yes
is it on every single machine in the

246
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:44,200
enterprise yes would be happy to find
that it is not seated passport and ten

247
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,070
years yes I would have access to
everything that's fine though

248
00:25:50,070 --> 00:26:08,690
what types are vulnerable are my
databases are decode it is hard coded

249
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:17,070
credentials are my IIS servers probably
figured ultimately want to solve both

250
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,790
pastors who want to put in some
randomized characters

251
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:41,890
microsoft does Microsoft wines I want to
create secondary within my environment

252
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,530
that isolate my domain controllers I
don't want them sitting in a while with

253
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:52,890
all my other I want to create a
secondary to my database nobody does

254
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:58,450
everybody ought to isolate isolate them
using jump server so I can isolate him

255
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:05,960
doing well here workflows plan some of
the newer things that we we see people

256
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:17,210
forgive you I know they're more basic
right some people have celebrated

257
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,270
hunting Hotspur your network maybe maybe
for web servers setup a lot of traffic

258
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:30,980
trip wires have a lot of wording on that
you have a work I have to wake up early

259
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,150
in the morning to get the phone I could
walk to the computer after final with a

260
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,990
problem is and then maybe

261
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:50,140
I copy code for getting think that a
programmer developer when he's hacking

262
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,860
he knows that alerts gonna go off and he
knows that he has about 15 to 20 minutes

263
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:09,860
before you actually react so you have to
be smarter and yet this crap or that

264
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,120
said an hour
