1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,610
alright thanks for showing up a first
talk artist forestry better penetration

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:18,109
testing my name is Patrick muscle in
your body

3
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,810
finding out of the day say today
interesting decided he wanted to take a

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:31,820
minute to look me up on line what I do
some work for PSE TSC is primarily a PCI

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,420
compliance company they do a lot
different services so my main concern

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,899
here that is interesting because I am a
real quickly some common ground for any

7
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,329
other penetration testers out there so I
said with PCI penetration testing

8
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:55,660
external internal application this is
very goal-oriented testing and its bring

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,239
that up so that you know I'm coming from
china military is as general and

10
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:10,450
everyone as possible so as to talk about
his possession testers we ingest the

11
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,330
large amount of data in limited time
brains and even when you start out with

12
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,930
good intentions with how you store and
manage that data it's very easy to get

13
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,490
tripped up and become less methodical
and things and what I want to do that

14
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,220
this talk is refusing strategies and
tools for modernizing practices and

15
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,310
capture data into an effective structure
help ensure accuracy security efficiency

16
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,729
making sure that we can store and access
data easily

17
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:49,920
also making sure that we're we're still
going through with everything we capture

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,159
how we gonna get through this I have a
sort of loose interpretation of the the

19
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:01,380
pen test execution standard their faces
they define good he's one of those at

20
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,640
Agra briefly about some sand data points
that get captured in the spaces and

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,039
after we talked about that one to go
into a couple of strategies that are are

22
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,340
are practices are tools that are loosely
associated with that that phase and how

23
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,250
we can apply those strategies for
jumping right in his evidence collection

24
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,569
start as an answer for me during any pre
engagement exchange with a client right

25
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,209
so in this case a couple of different
forms this may be a sort of official

26
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,670
data collection standard so maybe you
know this is my email maybe if they a

27
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,989
form that they fell out with your be no
definite scope dates and times for the

28
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:49,080
contact list also includes things that
are true that less official net no suit

29
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,670
a during meetings that have relevance to
you soon engagement challenges keep in

30
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,700
mind here there's a lot of variability
in format of the data we can get even if

31
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,739
you have a standardized approach to this
clients can often be creative in the way

32
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,049
that they fill them out if you don't get
the data accuracy can really come into

33
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:17,120
play here you know copy and paste shares
of an IP range can cause a lot of

34
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,980
problems in being careful is a big deal
so things that maybe don't even seem

35
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,079
incredible right off the bat they can be
important as well

36
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:31,500
contact info for an organization is a
big deal if you know you think something

37
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,680
strange going on environment may be
causing problems with the system you

38
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,019
want to show you need to contact in this
situation so I'm gonna jump in with a

39
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,299
concept I think everyone's probably
looks familiar with namespaces rape a

40
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:49,579
needs basis just that way or an idea
conceptually a way of encapsulating

41
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,769
items I grouping related files

42
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:57,000
determines common programming you write
code you run into this before but on a

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,670
file system he just called this folder
right it that's the way of making sure

44
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,540
that things that

45
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,299
together stay together a very simple
concept almost laughably obvious but

46
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,939
taking it for granted is called the path
of dark side will restore data

47
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:20,359
unintended ways unattended places with
data leakage and unintended retention of

48
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,979
employees at efu the freeways and
practices really just start defining a

49
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:34,330
namespace for any unique uniqueness base
for every engagement and simple enough

50
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,960
and quick application of this on the
screen here again this is this is very

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,650
simple but robust command prompt and
effective namespace make it really easy

52
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,789
to look at terminal cook identify where
you are and what you're doing

53
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,550
there's a ton really great ways to set
up a command prompt only wanted to point

54
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,360
out that it's something that should have
it as part of your should complement

55
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,759
what you're what you're doing your
testing

56
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,990
namespace defined for our project for
this engagement unique we also want to

57
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,289
structure for the day that goes into
that folder or namespace it's easy and

58
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,099
tempting to dump everything into the
route maybe what you want to do is is

59
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:24,820
wherever you are you gonna run a command
and leave the output there but as you

60
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,520
continue to testing collecting more and
more data makes it makes it much harder

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,240
to parse find something that you just
out but it's got thirty in map files

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,770
even if you name them effectively
becomes real hard to figure out which

63
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,479
one with which has so my suggestion here
btw details and how you separate folders

64
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,530
and there's a lot of different ways you
can organize them you know you could do

65
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,599
it by tool by activity and get the the
two samples out here in these are just

66
00:05:53,599 --> 00:06:00,070
sort of threw together it just might
Diaz does it really matter you can do it

67
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,190
by day of the week whatever you choose
is a structure

68
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,550
think the year prior year methodology
your process come up with a structure

69
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,430
that works for you and make sure that
you know

70
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,860
whatever the structure you pick is has a
focus on being easy to navigate and

71
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,480
descriptive at the same time so another
part of the setup is thing about your

72
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,190
virtual machine right and one thing at a
real one folks on here is avoiding the

73
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,440
cross-contamination of client data and
the reason I bring this up with

74
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,920
reference the virtual machines as I
think that the more ephemeral nature of

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,820
a virtual machine has a tendency to get
up to speed it down and delete it makes

76
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,720
us feel less cognizant of what we're
storing on them which sometimes is ok

77
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,030
but sometimes we end up with data center
around 20 minutes to get that that that

78
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,030
what are called the data leakage really
want to make sure we're not avoid

79
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:02,840
showing day that we don't want sitting
around 2012 that everybody's pilots

80
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,900
mother with that you can use to help
with this is Shane snapshots write a

81
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,370
snapshot preserves the state of the date
of receipt sheen at any point in time

82
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,020
it's a quick and easy way to create a
segregated testing environment for every

83
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,770
engagement you build a plant based
virtual machine

84
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,030
snapshot for the engagement name it
appropriately and then destroyed when

85
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,230
you're done and we've avoided a lot of
that headache of making sure that we

86
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,460
didn't leave policy tomorrow whether you
store your day primarily on your host

87
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,520
operating system or you were always in
your post machine and take the time to

88
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,930
set up the Shared Folders between the
two that complement your process so my

89
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,410
approach for dealing with this issue is
using a so-called bigger you're not

90
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,220
familiar with it it's essentially just a
command-line tool for building a custom

91
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,670
her son she notices from the base image
it said according to define a

92
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,540
configuration file look something like
this and you told the builder machine

93
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,569
and it does all the magic for you

94
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,429
so you just pretty simple this is just
an example of what it might look like

95
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:19,240
when you're spending up machine you say
you go diving is the directory where

96
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,779
your configuration file is there to
launch it and a few minutes later you

97
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:31,629
have your environment ready for testing
as to why do I use she's a some of the

98
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,620
same things as the virtual snapshot and
trading that segregated testing

99
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,240
environment at the same time as you
respect that the namespace of your

100
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,370
project right so I can put that figure
in the configuration file interact with

101
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:50,240
the machine in the project directory
also has a customized a very

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,680
customizable configuration files and
it's easy to have a consistent workflow

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,540
for each project we can quickly
configure the machine name shareholders

104
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,790
install specific software packages and
there's lots of potential for a

105
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,940
automation and the creating and editing
of the ball because it's it's

106
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:14,220
essentially a text to change so you end
up with something very custom to what

107
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,220
you need with very low effort alright
next phase into a gathering I kinda

108
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,339
grouped in a senate passes an extra
content just 44 remedies they did

109
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,930
together in this phase 10 the set the
game up for success or it certainly can

110
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,160
for example emails we harvest during
ascent and some custom password list

111
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,180
might mean you find success for you
otherwise might miss something

112
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,800
understanding what hoster active have
services long what you feel and can be

113
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,370
really daunting task of taking into
account the number of systems that might

114
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,949
be active on on a large network so I
think that think about and in the space

115
00:09:54,949 --> 00:10:01,649
here I found it useful for helping
ensure the consistency efficiency here

116
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,720
is a stripping in automating repetitive
tasks as much as I possibly can so

117
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,980
anywhere I can reduce the number of
steps for doing something the right way

118
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,910
take the time to do that Apple might be
opening terminals accessing data

119
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,380
regarding a specific project anywhere I
want to make sure I respect the name

120
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,380
face of the current engagement my
personal approach to this has been

121
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,650
called for if you've never seen before

122
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:37,510
politically that uses for to build
command line documentation essentially

123
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,140
for is a review took it for building
command line interfaces it also has a

124
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:49,960
nice little though the poor command line
tool will take a a file where you define

125
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,620
some test and review and turn it into a
full-featured

126
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,300
under command line up has uses
documentation that makes it very easy to

127
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,380
quickly install remove applications and
what this really means is you can

128
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:13,490
quickly build and deploy a fairly robust
command line up on the fly and how we

129
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,480
use this a wise it's useful I used for
programs to do a lot of things simply

130
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,260
interaction with projects and its files
on the screen you can see a couple of

131
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,500
tests that I've defined with the word
for interacting with other projects and

132
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,990
this includes your project creation
opening terminal windows in particular

133
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:40,540
show my the show function here this is
obviously a a simple example I'm sure

134
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:47,020
that you gave me your pregnancy lot more
range than this but very what I wanna do

135
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,240
is make it very easy to say for a given
project show me some data set and I try

136
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,680
I try to be inclusive with this have
lots of different pieces I can show

137
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,329
myself very quickly contact data I feel
you know if there's a list of

138
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,040
posted I'm not supposed to scan give
myself quick access to the data so that

139
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,869
I always have it on hand without having
to take time to look it up one thing and

140
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:16,869
one thing i mission is to open up
terminal windows and one of the reasons

141
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:21,959
that I do that it was walking my
terminal sessions it's a wonder goal is

142
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:29,429
to be thorough and make sure that we and
walking out homosexuals is that it's

143
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:34,170
really easy to forget to add a pipe out
something or add that that flag to make

144
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,999
sure we we save our our our data file
from a command line tool and you say

145
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,329
well just go back and copy and paste
that later at the terminal make sure I

146
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,040
get into text Bob relying on yourself to
do this increases the chance of

147
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,899
forgetting something missing something

148
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,910
your terminal dies forget assets
rollback whatever happens your day

149
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,249
disappears and and now you re-run it or
maybe it's something that's gone forever

150
00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:01,279
I think that the strip to manage
something is very fairly ubiquitous for

151
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,230
most Linux users and kiss you never
heard of it socially it's a very simple

152
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,489
command he told where you want to save
your console session does it when you're

153
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:17,149
done you tape and work is done and
additionally got in power so we can

154
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:25,319
start trans demanded that use the same
thing right next phase

155
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:32,339
exploitation post exploitation together
against for brevity this is I know for

156
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,369
me this is where things have a tendency
to get to get messy what I gained a

157
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:41,749
foothold I tend to chase the hackworth
get excited you get your first access

158
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:47,829
you trying to escalate as you let that
get away from you you know what we end

159
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,619
up doing is opening a lot of show maybe
you you stray shells and you got thirty

160
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:59,040
open or maybe a hundred 200 for managing
multiple network and try to remember

161
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,929
what's going on where it is exciting but
we're not careful cause a lot of

162
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:04,499
problems

163
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:08,339
rushing makes it hard to recreate what
you've done in turn increases the amount

164
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,089
I need for reporting it and and and
models up any communication with the

165
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,870
customer specially if its mission is
happening

166
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:22,990
during the engagement so is crucial for
this is walking a descriptive summary of

167
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,380
your significant actions that princess
this is a practice that was born of

168
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,180
requirement from PSC they require that
we keep a chronology

169
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,779
engagement and so over the years I've
kind of expanded this into a much more

170
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:45,160
robust practice that's very specific the
way that I that I work now doing a

171
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,970
mission this this process can can reach
back and affects other phases of a

172
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,560
testing but I find that comes the most
significant in that transition between

173
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,170
intelligence gathering and exploitation
when when used to this art accelerate

174
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,880
the pace of what's going on

175
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,210
running log to think cities is a simple
rape you know something that you think

176
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:11,270
is going to matter happens taken note of
it and then you know I know what else to

177
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,550
capture some of the the most relevant
output or just note a craft store the

178
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,650
files are related to it does a few
things for us feel strong situational

179
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,160
awareness of where you've been and where
we're going

180
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,040
forces just slow down a little bit about
what's coming next

181
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,670
in streamlining the communication with
the customer about you know what's going

182
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,089
on and during the engagement is also
really handy when it comes to clean up

183
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:40,510
any shelter open files that are are
dropped by councillors rated makes it

184
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,560
very very simple to go back and make
sure that those things are are remedied

185
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,420
before you leave so what you see on the
screen here this is actually an axe

186
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,010
murderer with or demote

187
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,130
it's essentially just a handyman

188
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,880
major mode for taking notes in an hour
on very easy to navigate have one so

189
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,550
which see it and yellow there are the
headlines and then you can expand or

190
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,899
contract and you think that's underneath
one of those

191
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,569
and you can you have again subheading as
many as you need very flexible very easy

192
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:20,959
navigation and makes it easy I can
compress everything inside of all the

193
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,629
headlines is very easy to read and
essentially have a narrative of

194
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:29,589
everything that's happened at all he
could do the same thing with magic tree

195
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,309
ever know I'm sure that them probably
has something similar because they

196
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:37,839
always do

197
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,600
final phase of testing so the good news
for for this part is this practice and

198
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,329
to meet you in their benefits as you
progress if you took the time to really

199
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:51,410
diligent in your evidence collection the
other phases of testing the reporting

200
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:57,470
because very very easy and you wanna
touch on one final little tool that help

201
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,529
and Silas and gather that is grabbing
the narrative so if you've ever had

202
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,630
tried to sit down and explain the
actions that happen and maybe some sort

203
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,919
of complex boasting exploitation
scenario to someone you can even get

204
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:16,409
future self even if the person who did
because talking about lots of lateral

205
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:19,980
movement and describing how these things
relate to each other can get really

206
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:28,610
really hard to track so I started off
just by drawing and I'm really terrible

207
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:37,260
artists so that it doesn't look great
but there's a graph is that will help

208
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,549
solve all this quick intro to touch on
on what it is all about this is a a

209
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,250
visualization sweet

210
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,960
several programs take the description of
graphs and a simple text language and

211
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,419
all the graph for us in the figures in
sort of see we have these are all these

212
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,919
are notes here and then you can see the
little girl areas they're just tells us

213
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,840
the relation

214
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,320
and told the jobs are wrapping it does
all the hard work for us this is a

215
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,750
specially simple example right here

216
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,740
his graphics can do lots lots of fun
stuff but at the same time it's very

217
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,809
easy to pick this up and and and have
something that works for you right away

218
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:26,850
just as a side note the atom text editor
got a great label extension that will

219
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,289
live under these graphs for you guys are
drawing them and so combining this tool

220
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:35,330
with our are sort of running narrative
are testing makes you very very aware of

221
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,909
exactly what's going on and then makes
it easy to describe to me when I know

222
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:47,399
how you got where you got during a
pentose alright so was take away our

223
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:52,409
practices around how we collect data
anything related to 10 tests should

224
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:58,580
ensure that we we are you all day is
accurate access it efficiently make sure

225
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,620
its thorough and obviously want to make
sure it's secure do a quick review of

226
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,990
your own methods your own practices and
make sure that there's that you're

227
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,630
trying trying to or achieving these
things and hopefully the tools in the

228
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:22,590
practices I want every day to maybe
improve some things girardi doing very

229
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:22,620
much
