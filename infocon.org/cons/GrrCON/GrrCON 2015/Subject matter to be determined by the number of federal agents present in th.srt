1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,089
the ball and also keeps getting bigger
disease the first year we took over like

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,779
two or three tables now we take global
one entire side of its own place

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:12,440
secondly the guys in orange and give
them a hug you give them alcohol as well

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,199
please they're all some guys they
volunteered that time so be nice well as

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,400
Chris responses

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,150
the reason we have alcohol the rest of
we can do with the hat for kids they go

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,910
walk young minds it's so much fun to do
this so much drink be merry and that

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,350
wall in the foyer its GNE be taking a
look at that will you can actually go

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,379
from the ground level up to that
mezzanine level have fun doing that much

10
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,300
fun to be had

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:56,100
alright so it's all gonna put it up on
line so we're gonna have some fun with

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,949
us but for those that are in the
audience that might have some kind of

13
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:07,350
law enforcement this is for you now as
nice as I can put it off because we're

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,000
gonna have some fun so the civilized
abstract about what we're gonna talk

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,369
about today as well as I can

16
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,740
the beauty of humans for all this week
we also have the capability to evolve

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:28,200
unfortunately that also comes with a
downside that we really are the weakest

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,900
link out there we are both the ability
have the ability to provide the solution

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,310
also unfortunately into way of putting
those solutions in place so gonna go

20
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,159
through the what's the White House Motel
past us but we'll take a blunt abstract

21
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,369
for a second as well now this is less
and you guys directly unless you are in

22
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:57,640
the position of Management therefore
probably in the way of security but it

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,570
is something for us all to take back to
the organizations that we worked for and

24
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,850
it really is a case of many of us many
of the guys in here it'll be standing up

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,500
on stage we've been doing this for many
years ago hired as a problem look here

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,250
it is

27
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,350
we've been doing this for 15 10 15 20
years yet the problem still keeps

28
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,640
getting worse but only does the problem
getting worse with finding new and

29
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,240
innovative ways to actually spread-out
nature everywhere

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,840
of which there will be many talks today
so the challenge of the question is for

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,720
all of us is whether we actually gonna
wake up and when we talk to those who

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,780
have the authority to have the ability
to actually enact change is what is that

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,470
trigger point that is actually going to
make the wake up for some it might be

34
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,020
the intellectual property for some its
financial for some and we've done before

35
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,890
we sat down in front of the CEO and gone
hi I know we kids go to school I know

36
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,780
what their names are know that both days
I know the bus I know the current

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,090
vehicle now get your shit off the ins
and that each one of these people and

38
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,350
organizations is a different trigger
point the challenge is is how do we get

39
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:17,310
to those people how do we actually get
them to think through this one in this

40
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,560
was ninety miles one did its trade off
to a little challenge now for those in

41
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,049
the audience unfortunate that are hoping
this is not gonna be full today's topic

42
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:32,530
is I will get yelled at and I will get
arrested probably again how we're going

43
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,080
to talk a little bit about this stuff
this one's the fun one to make for those

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,320
of you don't know what this is this is
8049 Mata targets but new Russian thing

45
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,920
that's out that the russians almost
different than us they build a tank to

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,739
give all the pieces to everybody else
including the source code we have the

47
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,400
source code for most of the T-forty
namitha tank now and it's run by GPS

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
uses a semi-autonomous things so it's
also a couple of us have now mapped out

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,290
exactly how to do a line Dunst and red
square next yo

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,510
if we can get it back on the tank red
square praised gonna be really

51
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:20,769
interesting so what else we messing with
how we gonna get into this

52
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,169
ironically the scary thing about this is
all the plane stuff I mean how many of

53
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,320
you being here how many would you like
your one year two years three yeah we

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,430
stood up to talking about pleadings
missiles also some other way jet and

55
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,150
they still didn't listen that's the
biggest challenge for us at the moment

56
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,720
was like ok how do we get people to
listen the new big thing everybody's

57
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,520
talking about is obviously the Internet
of Things on the internet of everything

58
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,750
presented over urs a bunch went from
somebody's Dacor of in and ended up at a

59
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,500
powered down all through the wonders of
the Internet of Things again we keep

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,270
adding these things into a life into our
systems how do we start controlling them

61
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,830
how do we work with the people of a
controlling them so a bit of focus for

62
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,550
today obviously address the elephant in
the room with the alphabet soup

63
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,620
cooperation is going to be a fun one
when do we talk when do we shut the fuck

64
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,440
up legal here and then go a little bit
of her and evolve or die diskussion so

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,330
the only thing I'm probably kind of
allowed is to say sideways aeroplanes

66
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,720
well physics says know as much as the
press and the media want to say yes

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,280
physics kind of says not for the stuff
that we did the research that was done

68
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,550
on those things unfortunately the actor
David that was leaked by the DOJ took

69
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,870
five years worth of information

70
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,229
compressed into to roll the
sensationalist paragraphs which is what

71
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,930
they used to get the search warrant for
all the equipment the challenge and all

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,060
that is fortunately it wasn't really
accurately represented that a problem

73
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,539
here possibly a problem with how things
were described as discussed possibly as

74
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:21,260
well but the one thing I definitely will
say is on the 2015 flights nothing was

75
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,529
done as part of the reason I'm still
standing here and not in a bright orange

76
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:32,950
jumpsuit as a says next time probably
not gonna mess around with it too much

77
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:41,729
although it was myself Justin and chest
were sitting on the plane yesterday with

78
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,010
the screenshot of ourselves and send it
to TSA and the FBI so we keep poking the

79
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,500
budget for shits and giggles of fun
thing about it is I was sitting on the

80
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,219
plane messing with the slide yesterday
and the other week when I was still in

81
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:57,650
overtime saddam and stuff like you know
probably shouldn't be editing these

82
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:04,949
slides while sitting on a radio play it
so let's talk about when and how and

83
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:10,930
what we do when we engage with a little
friends this one I love you think with

84
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,940
the fact that the NSA actually watches
everything though to figure out the

85
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:23,520
fuckin spam problem on their however
these

86
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,150
lot of guys the individuals the teams in
the potty is that we get to deal with on

87
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,490
a regular basis we still still deal with
on a regular basis I think the challenge

88
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,110
here is there is a diversity of systems
and people and the biggest issue on this

89
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,020
one but we still see today is it will
deal with one set of teams from a

90
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,009
particular agency because the feds for a
second will deal with one team at a

91
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,990
local level will deal with a different
team at HQ level then we'll deal with a

92
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,830
different team somewhere else and
unfortunately their ability or lack

93
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,300
thereof to communicate in between these
teams as well sometimes screw this up

94
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,620
but the argument is also the fact that
we need to cooperate with these guys and

95
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,669
we actually do need to work with them as
much as we want to win them up and have

96
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:25,349
fun with them to win the battle that was
based on their own actual no chance so

97
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:31,090
there has to be a level of cooperation
but the challenge is how do we balance I

98
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:37,320
corporation had to be retained but we
like doing which is breaking shit not

99
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,610
necessarily staying completely within
the rules all the time but still being

100
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,140
able to work with them still being able
to hand them actionable intelligence

101
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:55,290
help them understand what is going on
some of the stuff will talk about I'm

102
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,420
glad betsy's up here by the way have you
guys so Betsy on was it and BCC NBC who

103
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,180
the hell was it

104
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,440
CNN for Betsy go profiles

105
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,270
so let's talk a little bit about
cooperation I love drama restricted also

106
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:19,530
I think the challenge is a loss of us
who've been in the industry for a long

107
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,950
list under this is screwed up completely
on I like about here wanna play over

108
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,310
there but i cum a lot of us like pushing
the envelope a lot of us mess around the

109
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,030
lot of us get to a stage where we were
kinda wanna cooperates of you want to

110
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:40,180
work with them but what is the cost of
doing that and say you take a look at it

111
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,800
when you have to cooperate how do you do
it how do you talk how did you discuss

112
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,870
and unfortunately these bogus tend to
get involved as well so that any of you

113
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,800
that have seen some of the press it is
rather interesting because it's all over

114
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,080
the place

115
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,210
apparently according to one report on
county still locked up somewhere in

116
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,170
prison but last I checked I'm still
floating around as she managed to still

117
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,540
get my TSA period I can still go in and
out of the country apparently they still

118
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,880
let me in but if you have to deal with
the press and you are dealing with them

119
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,590
choose wisely

120
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:25,010
learn from some of my mistakes and
others appears around us on this one as

121
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,460
well start taking a look at who's asking
the right questions as you are dealing

122
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,220
with the people of the press understand
their job unfortunately for the most

123
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,520
part is to get the best most sensational
is news out there

124
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:47,260
your job is to protect your ass as best
as possible

125
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:57,510
you have a little situation you probably
want to get these guys involved

126
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:05,020
quickly eff has been freaking awesome I
dealing with a lot of the stuff when

127
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,030
your organisation you work for says that
they will work with you or they will

128
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:14,460
look after you'd as nice as you can put
it gracefully decline as best as options

129
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,300
their responsibility is to the
corporation and the organization itself

130
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:31,550
it is not to you Yes in the third party
and will look after you not them what we

131
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:39,810
did play

132
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,300
law enforcement the device you take a
screenshot please we've been putting a

133
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:50,660
bloody report today so no one on this
one

134
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,410
United got annoyed although this time so
just joined in the shot I was sitting in

135
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,100
germany what they wanted a Thursday
Thursday sitting in germany two days ago

136
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:08,769
and apparently looked down so I got a
phone call from United

137
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,529
looking and I think there's going to be
a couple of talks in the next couple of

138
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,589
days about this the Internet of Things
this is really the new and fun

139
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,199
playground four billion people

140
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,850
25 million apps over its 24 million nine
hundred ninety five thousand probably

141
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:36,600
won't be coded properly so what do we do
about a little bit about the manifesto

142
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,779
for a second I keep bringing millions to
this conference cause I keep like him I

143
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:47,379
keep having fun with them but to me they
represent us a better way of putting it

144
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,559
the biggest to one of the biggest
challenges we are facing as we go into

145
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,489
organizations these days is like a fine
we covered we have a cyber liability

146
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,230
insurance policy

147
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,369
publicly acceptable of one of those of
us that they asked us three questions do

148
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:06,670
you have security yes you have a
firewall probably is it a dollar

149
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,110
strength truck is not the next question
they typically ask and then they cover

150
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,819
you know which point you leadership goes
out and we're perfectly fine with

151
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:18,230
covered we don't have to worry about the
security thing anymore not a problem

152
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,029
what so it's bullshit

153
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:35,569
mayor is a simple question stuff and it
comes down to us humans ourselves many

154
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:35,910
of

155
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,630
especially the ones also stood up on
stage a quite honestly getting fed up

156
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:47,430
with mainstream humans were getting fed
up with organizations with entities they

157
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:53,500
just want to carry on going on the same
way they've been doing resentful of the

158
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,340
executives who sit there and think
security is a burden or it'll happen to

159
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,920
somebody else other issues and mouse
somebody else's problem will find the

160
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:11,250
media's over blowing it all the humans
again it comes down to us

161
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:18,820
of the people and the challenge is
dealing with the company's now and the

162
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,180
challenge is also looking at the
individuals that take an interest in

163
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,380
security and working with the companies
that tried to take an interesting

164
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,620
security rare is the personal company
that keeps this effort up for an

165
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,820
extended period of time how many of us
have walked into organizations or are

166
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,380
working in organizations where literally
you walk in go we have a problem and you

167
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,560
deal with it for the first three months
and the new shiny problem goes away and

168
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,550
they don't care about it anymore or
proactive security is actually

169
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,450
monitoring the firewall or maybe it's
buying the new blinking blue light fire

170
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,270
well as opposed to red blinky life I
will they both lost you can practice but

171
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:04,930
a new colored think you liked this year

172
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:13,610
abused the technology itself is there to
secure the problem but unfortunately the

173
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,960
human keeps getting in the way of the
equation

174
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:25,220
my worst enemy

175
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,829
human to know that but you can't make
them think I love horses

176
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:36,910
write the stupid things I got no freakin
breaks but I can feed carrots and it

177
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:48,699
seems happy so what do we do about it I
put this to you have some fun we had a

178
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,939
couple of talks about this last night
but imagine the situation

179
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:58,639
breaks into the company was great got in
a fun wasn't too hard to do was it for

180
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,129
most of us you break into the system

181
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:06,920
you look around you Patchett you put
antivirus on it

182
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,819
you encrypt the freakin hard drive cuz
they can't be asked to do it you secure

183
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:15,670
the damn day so they have and then you
get the hell out of there potentially

184
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,879
leaving the keys on the front doorstep
with a little note saying loves hugs and

185
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:28,339
kisses jaco imagine standing in court he
broke him a bad person and he fixed

186
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:35,720
everything what the fuck did he do any
damage nobody encrypted my hard drives

187
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:45,089
me the key those cyber stuff he
protected my dates up man

188
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:52,220
imagine having that legal discussion
your standing up there and you broke in

189
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,370
you got the thrill of breaking in which
is always the fun part about it

190
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,259
the thrill of fun part is getting into
the dam system once you're in it like

191
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:04,010
that plaintiff like the hell out of
those pics and screenshots get the pcap

192
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:10,669
follow well as it doesn't count by the
way for everyone during we do have pcap

193
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,220
files of airplanes

194
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:20,079
imagine the same thing with SCADA we all
know how many fund challenges that are

195
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,150
always SCADA but you break into the
power station kinda like we did it's the

196
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:30,260
Michigan cyber age was at a couple of
years ago I was spotted to cut the

197
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,100
pipeline is apparently a really cool
pipeline that goes all the way across

198
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:39,270
this state I've got the user IDs and
passwords if anybody wants them I don't

199
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,220
think they've changed them in like two
or three years but you break into the

200
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,039
damn place you take it off a plane txt
protocol that anybody man woman child

201
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:55,960
kid whatever conflicting Smith you put
protections in place you disconnect it

202
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,030
from some of the stupid shit they've got
in the corporate world and you protect

203
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:07,010
it and how much fun that would be having
that legal discussion now I don't

204
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,950
necessarily want to be the test case for
that to be perfectly honest give them my

205
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:23,210
recent indiscretions but it raises the
question should it be done to you yes

206
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:30,630
logic simply states we keep losing data
cuz we're not fixing the basics I still

207
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:37,630
shouldn't be finding 2008
vulnerabilities or 2003 Windows NTC over

208
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,919
the other day for god sakes I even had
to look up how to break the bloody thing

209
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,789
like shit like desist

210
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:54,640
books and they had the installation
disks for god sakes

211
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,580
shouldn't be fine in this and if we do
find it it should be heading somewhere

212
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:05,080
but logic says the data encrypted
arrested a motion is harder to steal

213
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,920
impossible but it's a hell of alot
harder to steal logic also says have

214
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,400
less people lost African credentials the
waterfall effect throughout the rest of

215
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,160
the industry is rather positive to us
here it's a fairly logical argument

216
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:32,480
unfortunately we're not dealing with
logic we dealing with executives road

217
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,680
repair that that's a problem we dealing
with health care system so you can scan

218
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,410
that but other network has all the
important shit on it and if you still

219
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,920
need it will break

220
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,140
yes I'm sorry that's kinda of those
running Windows XP because the

221
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,070
manufacturer says the only should run
Windows XP shoot the fucking

222
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:58,350
manufacturer take them outside tar and
feather their sorry ass as an example to

223
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,800
every other Sunni son of a bitch who
tells you that old shit should still be

224
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,710
ok seriously logics

225
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:17,049
says that we should be able to do that
said his the challenge for all of us

226
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:24,750
next time you research something next
time you decide to have some fun with

227
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,350
the device or an entity or a system or a
computer up don't just stand up here and

228
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:42,260
go haha your broker to make a fix for it
put something in place next time you

229
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:51,659
break a company or organization
government agency could sit down and

230
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:59,409
figure out how you would fix it work out
watching you could do to make it better

231
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:04,640
standing up here and exposing the
problem not good standing up here and

232
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,770
saying you have an issue and I've got
three solutions for you pick one

233
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:18,270
otherwise I'm gonna tell you the
question is on the challenges do you

234
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:24,059
call the agencies or the intelligence
community and say hey there's a problem

235
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:31,740
two issues here my issue with the whole
0 day world if you have a zero-day

236
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,890
exploit that could affect what we do in
this country 300 million people of which

237
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,870
most of them use Windows 2000 Windows 0
day exploit you got couple of options

238
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,830
you can give it to the government and it
will use it against a hundred 200 300

239
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,590
people

240
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,250
or you can put it out there put a
fucking fix out there and sold 300

241
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,890
million people's worth of computer
problems

242
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:07,100
ethical choice to me at this point I
think the next time something is

243
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,150
researched it should be this is well
broken this is how we broke it and here

244
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:19,799
is a fully automated script to fix it
and then we should just basically deploy

245
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,809
it and be done with it fixes the problem

246
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:32,539
removes the human couldn't help it had
put this one in can you guys read that

247
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:40,480
of the back yes so much fun so what am I
talking about here I'm talking about

248
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,720
taking a leaf out of the humans the
vaccination process that we have as

249
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,890
humans with you believe in vaccinations
oh don't believe in vaccinations an

250
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,080
interesting process at that take the
best part of a virus called Zeus pick up

251
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,970
a couple of others take the transport
methodology from Zeus take the attack

252
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,970
methodology from zoosk take you 10 days
to logic flow from attack to defense

253
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:16,039
turn around and say hey rather than
going out there and looking for credit

254
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,710
cards to basically hold them off and
sell them get out that look for credit

255
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,140
cards to encrypt the bloody things go
look for people's taxes on encrypted on

256
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,390
things leaving the keys goes it's more
fun but the argument is basically take a

257
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,830
look at the obfuscation of fragmentation
techniques that are some really nice

258
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,110
stuff that's being used by viruses

259
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,220
puts a resilient update architecture in
place not one that can be easily

260
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,820
discovered going out on the same port at
the same time everyday does not count

261
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:59,049
and then I say deploy it now in doing so
I would recommend putting a kill switch

262
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:07,280
in his we didn't do that the first time
and it went a little wild with very well

263
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:15,299
but we've got something running out
there running

264
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:19,659
the African continent for a little while
specially protecting quite a lot of

265
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:26,720
computers hundreds of thousands and it's
working as a vaccine no humans involved

266
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,879
nobody that I have to spend six months
arguing with or discussing why they

267
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,220
should or shouldn't have something
running away they should or shouldn't

268
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:42,929
apply for what they shouldn't do updates
we and our grandmothers and all parents

269
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:47,159
should not have to be the people that
keep up computers running we shouldn't

270
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:54,249
have to be the frickin experts it should
just work obviously working out some of

271
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:59,200
the kinks one of them was putting the
kill switch into it is we deployed in an

272
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,619
infected everything to get this shit we
can't make it stop

273
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:09,940
it's interesting when you are several
thousand miles away from your intended

274
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,899
target but he goes hi I'm gonna make
friends with the rest of the entire

275
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:25,139
continent you like she is dying that's
got nothing on this now this was done in

276
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,039
an altruistic manner

277
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,039
this is where the interesting part comes
in

278
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,869
no money changed hands no contracts we
agreed to no discussions had to happen

279
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:46,550
shit just got fixed

280
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,490
some of you

281
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:56,440
this probably the ones in the audience
with the federal Logis so I say this

282
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:03,460
there's no back doors in the code this
is not a master plan to take over the

283
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,220
world one computer 1 fridge one laptop
one toaster at a time

284
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,830
be fun to do that really calm be asked
to probably shouldn't I shouldn't

285
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:26,450
probably in charge of anything let's be
honest to me and I would argue to a lot

286
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:36,770
of us this simply a desire to see
progress to see things fixed and to see

287
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:44,290
stuff put right most of us I would argue
are fed up to the back teeth of watching

288
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,030
all of our freaking data be bought sold
traded lost or whatever the hell it is

289
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:57,700
some of us fucking OPM breach our little
frustrated because not only did all day

290
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:05,000
to go but families are friends all kids
are calling it the other shit why does

291
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,570
the decades couldn't look at the data
and that's just one of how many breaches

292
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:19,770
this year 7 poll

293
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,260
take a different view of it called
altruistic hacking if we want to at this

294
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,350
point in time personally I don't really
see a problem with it within certain

295
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,540
caveats how many of you wander around
best but you have fries up here is we

296
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,000
don't live in Colorado what he does best
buy microsoft be Microsoft up it s like

297
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,870
crack is no better place to play time by
paycheck I don't get a paycheck anymore

298
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,800
now that I when I thought the company I
am a checklist is just a wonderin

299
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:01,490
Microsoft ago I want I want I want the
shootout but I'm not gonna but I don't

300
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:09,620
see a problem either go to Best Buy go
to Microcenter pick up a Wiimote pick up

301
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,610
a nest pick up on the Internet of Things
device or two or three or four go pick

302
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:21,300
up a route up right switch was talking
to my camp too long bloody Reuters

303
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:29,500
writers Reuters seriously guys I did you
miss with the language properly but go

304
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:36,990
get something I don't care if you mess
with Collins again it was so much fun

305
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:45,300
go get yelled at the go get something
that you can break take it to pieces

306
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,810
physically take it to pieces
electronically reverse engineer the damn

307
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:56,860
thing take a screwdriver its who is
because the simple fact is we keep

308
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,670
accepting more and more and more of this
debt into our lives and we don't mess

309
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,250
with it as much or if we do we going to
the manufacturer's going high there's a

310
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,070
problem like oh yes join the queue
there's a whole bunch of you that have

311
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,580
problems and you get ignored

312
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,260
I'm not wearing one of the Apple
watching things cause I bricked my fifth

313
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,799
bit better I think it was I got to a
stage who have you guys got their butts

314
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,880
that great if I still have my Fitbit on
whoever's got the most steps it would

315
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:35,039
take the steps from you as much easier
the media in the bloody steps but Fitbit

316
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,990
has an open authorization architecture
for certain bids of your information not

317
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,880
for everything but there's half-a-dozen
elements of your information including

318
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,720
step counts in a bunch of other stuff so
you can turn your passive fit that into

319
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,620
an active fit that make friends with
everybody else is freakin said that I

320
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,630
just take them down data now I had to
break if you ship is to figure this shit

321
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:06,679
out but it was fun and not enough to
walk as much but take that mentality and

322
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:13,059
apply I don't care for the new bloody
but was it I saw the other day it was an

323
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:18,529
Android enabled washer and dryer
absolutely hilarious if you get them to

324
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:22,039
Best Buy's wireless network when you're
in the store you can actually do some

325
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,399
testing in there was quite fun to do not
that I'm advocating that cuz that's not

326
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,880
nice but have fun with it and it's also
running an old version of Android news

327
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
about a list about that long of exploits
you can do to get into it once you've

328
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,590
got into it you can drop thing onto it
and then you can have fun with their

329
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:46,510
home network as well but it's stuff like
this that we need to be doing more and

330
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:51,580
more of the tech is coming into our
homes and our lives and our systems are

331
00:30:51,580 --> 00:31:01,470
we not touching it or if we are the
manufacturers are ignoring it

332
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,870
chase you guys are well aware we have 25
yes I think you know what is the first

333
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,640
time I said I guess what we can do to a
747 it took the fed's four and a half

334
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,720
years to wake up and go ahead but we
want to pay attention to this guy its

335
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,470
listing off an airplane

336
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:26,179
might have provoked the situation that
seriously

337
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:33,720
break it and then when you've broken it
figure out how to fix it and then

338
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:42,649
arguably there is an argument to say
just deployed the damn fix

339
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:52,139
thoughts so the next time you are in
your target of choice you're knee deep

340
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:57,749
ankle-deep elbow deep in code reverse
engineering and you've gotten the pcap

341
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:03,779
file and you've taken the damn screen
shots for the organization the company

342
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:10,710
the record or whatever else I'd argue
you fix that code you patch this system

343
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,179
maybe you make them aware maybe you
don't if you do you have to deal with

344
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:24,100
humans if you don't things magically get
fixed encrypted sorted leave the keys

345
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:33,040
behind and then get the hell out of
there figures to you

346
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:39,590
a well-loved phrase of a Volvo died from
packet storm from how many years ago

347
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:50,340
10:15 long time we have to get better
we've got to take the falls out of this

348
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,660
thing and we have to do a better job of
protecting the system's the problem is

349
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,980
the technology is there to protect
everything two years ago when you bought

350
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,320
the blinky firewall freaking green
blinking light firewall it was possibly

351
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
adequate to fix everything

352
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,390
the fact that you maybe don't have the
resources to look after the logs what's

353
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,870
the logs moments of the damn things
unfortunately for most of us isn't your

354
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,580
fault the humans getting in the way to
say oh no you can't have more people got

355
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:25,720
a log file will just be happy with the
blinky file looks we don't need to worry

356
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,720
about those things it's arguable that
the security that we put into

357
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,210
organizations should be more
commoditized for a lot of organizations

358
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,640
that you probably work for or for a lot
of companies that we break into on a

359
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,870
regular basis

360
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:50,300
security is not their key focus they
make wages they shouldn't have to worry

361
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,590
about patching every five fucking
minutes they shouldn't have to worry

362
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:59,180
about what release firewall but down
stuff should unfortunately for the most

363
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,490
part work but we haven't designed it
that way we haven't put it in that way

364
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:10,540
we're still fixing our own systems and
we're having to do with the humans to be

365
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,550
able to put the patch is out to be able
to do it again i dog you we just get out

366
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:23,030
there and we fix it out themselves

367
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,790
those of you that a presenting for the
next couple of days here and at other

368
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:32,530
locations do not just say what's broken
I challenge you to stand up here and

369
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:40,540
provide people with the ability to fix
the problem I also hate the idea thank

370
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:46,220
you for those of you that he using this
stage is a freaking infomercials for

371
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,140
your company and the propaganda quit
that shit

372
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,460
the people that they hear that are gonna
stand in front of you wanna hear stuff

373
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,970
they do not want to hear what you're
frickin company can do to fix it they

374
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:05,550
want to hear what they can do to fix
stuff and the latest filed with the blue

375
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,090
blankie light is not going to fix
everything for you

376
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:15,100
the hardware that your CXO wants to buy
probably isn't going to fix it either

377
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:21,140
you probably have most of the solutions
already in-house you have to have the

378
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,110
resources to fix it

379
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:31,890
unfortunately the leadership needs to
get the hell out of the way

380
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,600
put these little things in the casino
download city jump in the river planes

381
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:43,890
loaded with the whole presentation full
of airplanes lights system may I keep

382
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,630
joking about messing around with the
lights on the eastern seaboard right she

383
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,020
messing with the lights on the western
seaboard one of the western United

384
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,520
States cities has taken all of its
lights and all of its city lights and

385
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,050
they've made them Wireless I want to
send rude messages to the ISS station

386
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:12,830
I've got half the code built and it
simply gonna say fixed by 127 001 I'm

387
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:21,350
nobody's gonna be other changes this is
something we also forget this is

388
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:25,260
something we put in there as well I
think we're getting better at it these

389
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,630
days and I think the message that we
conveyed to organizations and

390
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:35,070
corporations is getting better when we
first came on the scene like a

391
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:40,490
high-profile implacable fix everything
and then the bad guys when I went round

392
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:45,740
the fire will only like pastas will put
ideas like BS in place and they went

393
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,910
through the IDS IPs and the IDs but I
think it went that way too far away with

394
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:58,450
not one of the logs lasted for 24 hours
and it was six months before we realized

395
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:08,450
that shit win this is a game of chess
that we are playing a good job of it

396
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:13,170
either so what do we do

397
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:22,460
did the questions to take back to the
organization's we work for did they

398
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:29,280
really understand the problem did they
actually know the risks the organization

399
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,119
faces it's a simple question but it's a
lot harder to answer because

400
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,859
unfortunately sometimes some of the
people you ask that question to a going

401
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:44,250
to have to look in the mirror and you're
gonna have to help them do that

402
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:50,000
sometimes the biggest risk is the guy in
the biggest freakin chair getting the

403
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,790
biggest paycheck and it's your job to
help them understand that that's not an

404
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:05,640
easy message tonight be reality TV shows
I shouldn't say too much because I had a

405
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,670
any stuff a camera my nose a few weeks
ago apparently I know stuff about

406
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,700
the.net so any is thinking about doing
the whole series on the document we want

407
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,579
this ugly much as he talked to them
about it so if I'm on TV soon with an

408
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:24,420
English civilized sensible accent to be
surprised that these questions you take

409
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,760
back to the organization who is advising
them who are they listening to is it the

410
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,829
guy with the plane ticket and the
consulting license or is it you guys and

411
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:39,430
it is not you guys how do you convince
them otherwise what do you have to do to

412
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:47,930
help them communicate or help
effectively communicate with them

413
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:58,540
Emily the procedures what are they doing
so many organizations we walk into the

414
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,090
hive got a firewall got the latest
blinky lights great what do you do with

415
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,500
it we look at it it's cute when the Blue
Bloods faster we know we have problems

416
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,020
to rate is the procedure and don't know
we have a guy standing there he looks at

417
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:20,790
it all day lets you change that put
controls in place

418
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:29,960
help the organization most of them like
that paper up most of us people with a

419
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,530
passion

420
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:37,130
best part of a princess who drove him
should not have a report about it we

421
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:45,120
just take a picture of the flag no that
isn't why simple stuff but helping

422
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:52,300
organizations understand the controls
and crying out loud with you please do

423
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,180
the best level best you can to try to
stop them thinking that a freaking audit

424
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,930
is a pen test locking the order to in a
room and feeding them stuff underneath

425
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:09,620
the door doesn't count I don't care if
you put it in that exact language I

426
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,350
don't care if you take a screenshot of
this presentation and send it to those

427
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,190
buggers stick it on the forehead or do
something

428
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,220
help them understand that again

429
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:30,760
humans we are getting in the way of I
was cells which goes to the culture we

430
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,440
are

431
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,630
he once we are the easiest ones to
social engineer with the easiest ones to

432
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:41,890
bypass we are the ones that typically
fail first yet we are still the

433
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:47,380
Guardians we are still normally not
allowed to be abused is not fun at all

434
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:55,050
and yet also with the ones that we tend
to spend less money on to educate that

435
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,839
equation doesn't work it's got to change
as well

436
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:11,010
help your organizations understand that
this was the tough one this goes back to

437
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:18,440
a little minions when the organization
stands up and goes boom we only lost a

438
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,560
hundred or we only lost a thousand
identities our database has a million

439
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,190
people but we only lost 2008 great but
it took us six months to figure that

440
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:34,339
shit out but we did it you know what
congrats you fucking license you screwed

441
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:40,400
1,000 people out of their lights that
sees the retort you have to give back to

442
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,550
that organization when it's a risk
analysis that it will cost them three

443
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,780
million to protect the system but the
worst find that they will get his two

444
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,500
million that's he's not an equation that
is acceptable

445
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:01,170
help them realize that last

446
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:09,089
we're still relatively human arguably
the mentality stays it is we are not

447
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:21,349
going to win so what we do stop talking
about how we can't do things were not

448
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:27,490
won in over the last 40 minutes talk
about how we do solve the issues

449
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:31,170
hopefully I've given you guys some
thought some ideas to the presented

450
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:36,549
hopefully I've now provoked you going oh
shit I need to add another slide but we

451
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:41,619
have to change the approach that we have
the electronic profile the people

452
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:47,450
outside even the people inside the
organization and it all comes down to

453
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,450
data it's quite simple where is your
data when we took out the airplanes and

454
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,579
we had fun with them we didn't go mess
with airplanes directly will not begin

455
00:42:55,579 --> 00:43:00,410
with we went to the third party
companies that made the planes we went

456
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,510
to the manufacturer's the made the
components of the planes we went to the

457
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:09,970
all the various different organizations
that discusses planes and we did all the

458
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,680
ocean's intelligence-gathering that we
possibly could

459
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,329
which is exactly what the attackers do
as you talk to your organization's about

460
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:25,339
security it isn't just about them more
about you it's about all the various

461
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:29,970
places that they too results with the
employees with the vendors with the

462
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:36,150
suppliers with the vials with everybody
that has its fingers into your data when

463
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:40,380
the vendor out their cells you a new
piece of equipment when they turn around

464
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,420
the post something like a I just told
them a whole bunch of new toys pays

465
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:50,040
their sorry asses cause I go oh shit
they've got this file will forget it I

466
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:57,349
go this way underground the damn thing
stop them from giving your stuff away

467
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:03,670
and then we focus on the people

468
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:13,710
actually I'd argue how to get around to
the people so I will say it again I said

469
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,849
earlier I said again we have one hell of
