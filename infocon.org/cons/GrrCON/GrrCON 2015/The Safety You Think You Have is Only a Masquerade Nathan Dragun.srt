1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,810
I don't know if we're gonna get started
just a few minutes early customers

2
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,119
travel is a kind of come in but I see
these are the last survivors of Groupon

3
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,449
2015 alright guys have a good time right
on right on to how many people here are

4
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:39,440
not still new but i'm for the first time
people like kim also ok all right so

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:48,610
four get started and I'm kinda like I i
dont know if I'm going to be pissed on

6
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,719
the wrong people off especially since
it's kind of going online so I figured

7
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,239
I'd let's add a couple disclaimers and
with all legal things I figured let's

8
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,340
make it as small as possible so what did
you need to listen and our watches

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,550
presentation you agree that this

12
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:21,170
myself I wasn't going to mention them so
I disclaimer to the views and opinions

13
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,409
expressed in the following content may
or may not be that of myself Greek honor

14
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,509
those who have or will ever work for any
third on try to keep an open mind

15
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,530
there's probably things that depending
on where you're slanting is it my go

16
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,670
contrary to view point with that in mind
we're gonna try to keep politics out of

17
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,159
this as much as possible and no riding
cos I'll probably not be asked to come

18
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,710
back to the speaker ever again and that
would suck so alright so let's get

19
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,420
started setting the stage so I use this
long title that sounds like it's going

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,060
to come monocle unlike have a
long-lasting my hand but what are we

21
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,670
talking about when we're talking about

22
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:07,540
safety you know stuff so the background
behind this is interesting dad and his

23
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,140
hobby he liked you look at cycles in
history in Ti what happened before cos

24
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,069
chances are it's going to happen again
and back in early 2003 tells me you

25
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:21,470
randomly out of the blue there's gonna
be a crash in 2008 I'm like 11 and then

26
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,670
he starts telling me about a little more
about it and then I'm picking art will

27
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,190
what if that does actually happen for us
if you like an idiot if I knew about

28
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,660
this like five years before and they
don't do anything about it you know we

29
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,970
will end of the world comes but that
move thought was alright what could

30
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:41,069
potentially happen Mr prepared and this
is more like a culmination of that

31
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,850
knowledge and i've kind of continued
sense because the reality is our rules

32
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,750
fragile and we take a lot of things for
granted so few things I want you guys to

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,370
take apart are taking away from this
first is what relevance as formation

34
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,430
have to you how can you really applied
to one thing is you something and say oh

35
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,180
this one thing could happen but when you
take it internally and realize our it

36
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,840
doesn't apply to me or not I think it
just makes it real on a whole new level

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,180
and that second what can you do about it
but some of the stuff I'm sharing and

38
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:18,690
apply it so so if you don't know your
not see believe it or not so and on that

39
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,570
note we're going to you may not even a
lack really good news is good golly

40
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,390
alright being sold for Lisa Leff ok so
alright so on that note we're gonna dive

41
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,700
right into you probably the one the most
controversial topic not yet I'm like a

42
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,500
couple slides ahead of myself right so
you want to know the facts here

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,420
what you guys think the average time it
is for promoting an attack that take

44
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,720
place like once you start someone comes
out how long you guys seem to take wow I

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:02,550
didn't get it what ya 30 seconds ten
seconds ago fast attack in the world

46
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:09,050
alright so it's actually 30 to 60
seconds were o'clock CNN I've seen some

47
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,330
people argue it ninety seconds but you
know what that's where we get the idea

48
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,190
writes a very small small period of time
I don't know if he comes down to

49
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,640
something we see in movies where someone
isn't acting like a five-minute scene or

50
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,460
you know your adrenaline is pumping so
every second feels like an eternity but

51
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,260
in reality it's you're looking between
30 and 60 seconds what do you think the

52
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:40,440
average police response time is our for
her four-minute span Rapids being

53
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,310
different

54
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:52,700
yea or flint is very like two days right
i mean for hours wow four hours alright

55
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,770
so the national average is 10 minutes

56
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,250
yeah the best time was four minutes for
the entire nation it was really weird

57
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,590
I'm reading this report it said they're
applauding this town for having a nine

58
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:11,470
minute response time I'm going left
those 50 PCs together so you get it act

59
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,100
like 30 seconds to start someone's
calling that in you gotta wait another

60
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,910
nine minutes let's just called three
ministers to view you know we've got the

61
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,979
best police officers in a world where
you gonna do it during that time period

62
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,630
maybe he did you know maybe you're
bleeding and dying you really don't want

63
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,550
to rely on the police to take care of
you kids that's not their job to do

64
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,490
today is so we commit a crime they're
there to dispense justice take that

65
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,580
person's community that crime to chill
out there did you let your personal

66
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,290
bodyguard and take a bullet for the care
about people but they've got lives and

67
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,539
families to rely on them is a false
sense of security

68
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:57,680
we're gonna jump right into something
highly controversial on that point which

69
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,000
brings us to the next point where by the
way than a ridiculous I cannot believe

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,970
this I heard a story on the way up here
where a friend of mine got in trouble

71
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,060
they had a garden at home and they've
got like peppers and stuff like that the

72
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,919
they grow your kid brings pepper to
school having fun with it what one of

73
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,990
his buddies they know it is his buddy
eat it started on my gosh is a pepper

74
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,270
you know watering is like he needs water
is kinda freaking out about it next to

75
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,970
you know the kid who brought the pepper
to school get to you know get to

76
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,200
detention yet the key to put in a bit
you know obviously knew doing but they

77
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,240
just seem so messed up to me it's it's
so backwards so it was back on pointe

78
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,990
yeah alright so simple about guns
alright good guys have guns bad guys

79
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,099
have guns a balance of power

80
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:48,979
you remove that from the good guys and
the bad guys have power it's simple it's

81
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,680
history look back through all time

82
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:06,440
yeah alright bigamy legal doesn't work
right so more more reasons why we can

83
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,860
argue his case if you're looking for bad
guys we got guns we want to inflict the

84
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,820
most amount of harm and damage to some
place where would you target

85
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,420
I'm actually surprised how many people
give me feedback at fifty one or two

86
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,900
people now i cant hear about it seems
like a great yeah it's so obvious places

87
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:34,100
but what it really comes down to you is
places that gun free zones let's go back

88
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,780
to the thought is it lets 49 power will
go to the concept art a ten-minute

89
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:45,380
averaged across the nation if I'd means
I have a desire to harm her people I

90
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,290
wanna know where can I go then I'm not
going to get her back I've got the most

91
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,500
amount of time to maximize damage and I
wanted you to watch people go where

92
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:00,090
there's not legally guns allowed schools
movie theaters we get the idea of doing

93
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,490
a little research on this I encourage
you to check out more about this because

94
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,670
I've been completely validated it but
you know I mean it's USA Today coming

95
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,540
through much with it yet but they're
basically saying that every mass

96
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,020
shooting since nineteen fifty separate
to happen to gun free zone it's kinda

97
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,480
messed up you think we can get the clue
maybe fifty sixty years later

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,500
alright then less arguing I was headed
to pick up with this trying to explain

99
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,740
to people why do I have a gun to my
thought was well if someone's endanger

100
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,410
all I can help them protect myself but
it's common sense man yeah it's not

101
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,360
respecting you attack but yeah you're
not expecting a fires you gonna run

102
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,770
while you still have a fire extinguisher
just in case someone that the best

103
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:47,810
argument ever heard so like if u agree
it's a cpl the CW's I want to touch on

104
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,450
this briefly because if you like there
is a common misconception and we kind of

105
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,260
mixed terminologies if I go to a police
officer I don't want to see her get a

106
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,640
CCW because in their mind it's also the
same term they use for if someone is

107
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,910
legally or illegally he live carrying
concealed weapon news the same thing so

108
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,030
if you get from it you want to talk
about getting encourage people to use

109
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:14,400
like a computer concealed pistol license
terminology with that so

110
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,810
more statistics regarding trillion
Michigan this is how many people in the

111
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,760
state of Michigan have licensed to carry
concealed but 480,000 and the graph

112
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,330
showing from October 14th October 15
2015 1415 how many licenses are

113
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,750
currently out there did the two numbers
we got about 9.91 million people in

114
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:44,880
Michigan as of 2014 I totally do this
right it comes out about 4.4% about one

115
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,050
in 20 people have concealed carry
licenses kinda weird to think about it

116
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,800
there's hundreds of people in here i
think is hundreds whatever we got a

117
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,470
bunch of people in here but around you
every day you're you're passing people

118
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:03,050
on the highway in work all this stuff
and you realize that one in 20 people if

119
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,230
not less or greater you know variable
have licenses security you're actually

120
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,880
surrounded by guns and you don't even
realize it a try to figure out why

121
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,160
there's this fear in this facade of you
know you know guns in it and i think

122
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,740
what it comes down to these movies and
entertainment have still amplified in

123
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,220
made it such like it like a hyped-up
thing you know someone like diving

124
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,150
through walls you know the kind of crazy
stuff and increases because it's like a

125
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,640
journalist response in US I think that's
what happens now in you know you see

126
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,790
something in the real world you can't I
ending to that

127
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,500
remember this from years ago and I think
was from an FBI study but believe it or

128
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,420
not people to have these licenses to
carry concealed or twelve times less

129
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,690
likely to commit a crime

130
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,440
the main reason arguing behind that for
why this is the case is that people who

131
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,740
carry go through you got to consider why
York if you care about me I gotta figure

132
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,750
I'm gonna have to use it someday it'll
get to use it going to shoot somebody

133
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,100
and that means the chances are I'm gonna
kill somebody if you're not ready to do

134
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,600
that don't carry a gun if you're not
ready to that moment you pull a gun on

135
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,420
someone who's hurting somebody if you're
not ready through that that person to

136
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,730
take a gun from you you become a victim
the people around you become victims so

137
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,320
let us like a logical something goes on
there but don't take my opinion for it

138
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,730
you know I like this this is from 2014
there we have a police officer who share

139
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:44,889
his opinion to join the police force
Detroit see hope this works maybe yeah

140
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:51,079
before him but in my view you know we
look at our good community members to

141
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:57,920
have concealed weapons there's a greater
likelihood in the city Detroit that then

142
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,509
shoot and part of the thought behind
that again this is when I was coming in

143
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:08,949
the door is the lack or absence of
confidence in his police department that

144
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,720
we would get there that would
investigate and do the kind of job it

145
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:24,169
was sworn to do legal dog eyes trying to
grow well you know i guess im education

146
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:30,169
in the great state of the main domain
has a model the way life should be and I

147
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:35,059
think I was caught by surprise coming
from california where it was I mean

148
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:41,519
concealed weapon from its at that time
it was an act of Congress to get one

149
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,629
please she's distant that offer or spore
give approval for that I go to maintain

150
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,879
their stacks of you know I see CW's and
I was denied because that's my

151
00:12:53,879 --> 00:13:00,230
orientation what was interesting about
main lots of concealed weapons permit

152
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:06,139
the orientation change very quickly but
here was a key what may be the safest

153
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,160
places in america

154
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,509
one of the safest places in america is
not by crime is non-existent certainly

155
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:19,610
and pour demain ahead gangs had
narcotics suspects that shootings but

156
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,009
clearly suspects news good americans

157
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:31,689
little more legit right he's got a bad
you know we've got a dynasty to the

158
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:38,800
microphone that's kind of the whole gun
thing so when we gonna go into different

159
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,180
areas

160
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:50,240
yeah I did you know where this is going
so security theater we're led to believe

161
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,199
that these guys saying it is awesome we
posed picture local serious like once we

162
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,470
get through them we're gonna be
completely safe which by the way I'm

163
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,740
sure our tax dollars paid for this photo
up this awesome scary looking woman on

164
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,350
the look great and all that but let's be
honest here let's just stick with the

165
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,819
facts in our personal biases right
because let's be honest we get a little

166
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,699
jaded we get angry at me for personal
opinions and so let's just get the facts

167
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:23,819
and based on that we're just gonna point
out how effective they are I put this

168
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:27,930
article you'll see that we're we're
pulled it from the end but so the recent

169
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,490
security audit found that the TSA has
failed to find fake explosives and

170
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:43,050
weapons in 96% of covert tests 96% and
members of the congress familiar with

171
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,880
the classified details see the body
scanners are to blame for much of the

172
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,790
problem last time I checked I think most
of the mechanisms that the use of the

173
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:59,009
TSA are the body scanners so yeah so
Republic representative Betty Thompson

174
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,670
of Mississippi the top democrat of the
whole career on the House Homeland

175
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,300
Security Committee said that while the
TSA has spent a fortune on new equipment

176
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,319
his troubled about the cap at a
capability to detect and prevent

177
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:15,269
dangerous materials for passing through
security checkpoints I mean little

178
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,939
concern to you especially the ninety-six
percent of your mind really

179
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:25,989
gets worse so just said that while the
bomb detection is obviously a complex

180
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:30,899
undertaking these things we've been
catching Metal Gear the messed up part

181
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:38,599
this is pulled from political August
2015 not two months ago so we're led to

182
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:42,339
believe that ever since 2008 when they
started planning implementing the

183
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:49,429
system's up until now than I did in
picking a metal that's Kenema stuff we

184
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:54,899
just don't know why I'm just kinda blown
away with this day information I do you

185
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,720
really know what to do with it when I
heard that they are going to keep going

186
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,449
cuz you know cost me they just don't
have enough funding right they just need

187
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:06,309
more money so I want to go through and
figure out how much money that she spent

188
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:10,989
on these scanners because they've been
completely replaced several times and we

189
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:16,709
start back in 2008 where they deployed
about 45 machines at about $150,000 each

190
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:22,239
like something six million whatever and
another time period between this time

191
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:27,129
and I think 2010 they spend another 73
million dollars throwing out more

192
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,859
devices but don't worry the user
stimulus money to stimulate the economy

193
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:37,929
somehow to put more these systems in the
2010 to replace another 500 it is

194
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:42,470
spending another eighty eight million
dollars

195
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,620
of course these are completely safe
right you know the images aren't you

196
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,810
know accessible not since never know
there's no health risk missing you know

197
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,680
whatever they replace him again in 2012
I couldn't find the exact specifications

198
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,370
for you know what the spending 2012
replace that stuff but yet another

199
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,940
asking for another hundred and sixty
million dollars to replace all the

200
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,470
equipment because of his latest thing in
August that got released but only a

201
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,940
hundred twenty million going toward more
scanners but don't worry that are

202
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,960
running out of money as it turns out
that their annual budget is 7.9 billion

203
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:26,090
dollars what I was thinking about that
I'm like you know what the people that

204
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,700
we got here at Gurgaon I can guarantee
would probably better safely secure all

205
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,390
the airports in the nation for like half
a billion dollars so what the hell are

206
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,550
they doing with his other money cuz
they're obviously not using it for

207
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:43,480
training I just don't get it just amazes
me this might account for part of it

208
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,820
Huffington Post 2012 name this is
actually was reported from several news

209
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,430
sources I just happen to pick these kids
you know whatever I pick political in

210
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,490
the last one so this at dozens of pieces
of security equipment that cost

211
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,810
taxpayers an estimated eight four
million I were supposed to be installed

212
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,910
at an airport checkpoints three
passengers were found to be collecting

213
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,300
dust in a government warehouse a joint
congressional panel reported this to

214
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,070
this is not like you know Joe Blow
saying hey there's a bunch of stuff here

215
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,040
this is up additional reporting stuff so
I'm just thinking this is just this is

216
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,090
insane

217
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,180
they obviously have no budgetary stuff
that they know what they're doing just

218
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:27,750
this is just stupid no consistency right
for the last time you went to the

219
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,200
airport and you just brought something
through you realize later oh idea has

220
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,170
realized even have this in the bag in my
bag it always seems that it comes due

221
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,029
whoever's at the scanners at the at the
gate

222
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:45,429
the metrics change you know I could
leave at one time I heady what was it

223
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:50,619
like what three outs are still shopping
for auto repair liquids will join LG

224
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,960
bottle there was clearly marked on the
signs to what the ounces where and i'd

225
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,090
like nothing in it and go to the airport
and the guy goes you can take the studio

226
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,320
mic quite clearly obviously it looks
less than three ounces of fluid in here

227
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,489
albeit with a bottle can hold more
liquid no shit but there is obviously

228
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:11,330
says it's less than three ounces so
what's the big deal just unbelievable

229
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:17,139
I'm just what and other time of taking
the scene Audi bottle through the

230
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:23,239
complete with water never even stopped
just like everyday airports has

231
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:27,729
different things I do they care they
just rolled dice one-time actually took

232
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:35,710
a wooden hanger with me through you know
where for my clothes and somehow got

233
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,339
busted on the trip so I figure I'm gonna
have no problem getting back through the

234
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,539
you know the airline going home to get
this

235
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:46,669
the sharp object possibly a wooden
hanger thing and I'm just thinking wow

236
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:50,039
this is crazy how many objects can we
take through that aren't on the approved

237
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,809
list that we can use weapons

238
00:19:53,809 --> 00:20:00,580
ridiculous so that's why I say one thing
well give us more risk you know not even

239
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,200
imagine seeing that we are worried about
like a gun shooting happening a little

240
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,330
like Detroit Metro Airport where people
diving over wolves and this and that

241
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:13,039
what happens if something happens a
plane actually runs into the building or

242
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,049
something happens where people are
trapped if i dont have like a pocket

243
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,200
knife on me you know how we gonna do
first aid medical tech stuff for other

244
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,869
people but only have the bare
necessities to take care of others is

245
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:30,659
just a disaster waiting to happen so I
can go back to you why do we even have a

246
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:31,549
TV

247
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:37,039
gonna come up I think a series this
weekend to give people the idea of used

248
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,989
to using the stuff to feel like you're
safe

249
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:46,369
obviously we show and it's not effective
right 96% so I take this one step

250
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,450
farther and I kind of think it's the
idea is not only to get people

251
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,139
comfortable with it but keep it long
enough and people just assume is

252
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:57,460
acceptable and what you want to change
the other kids these days

253
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,549
iPad and all the stuff and you can't
even imagine life before technology same

254
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:08,210
idea given another 10 years our kids why
don't have kids but your kids are just

255
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,549
gonna assume that the TSA has always
been there in this acceptable thing for

256
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,049
me to what we're get strip searched for
whatever in order for me to be safe then

257
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:19,509
there's no more challenges most of us
probably put up with it because we need

258
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:25,509
you to know to get to conference is to
go along with their daily lives really

259
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:30,590
cool quote that surface on the tweet in
the Greek stuff kinda going on you know

260
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,879
and this person basis increased we have
an expression nothing and nothing is

261
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:39,609
more permanent than the temporary I feel
like there's so much in those few words

262
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:44,999
because if you don't say we got it ended
when this is gonna stop it just keeps

263
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:49,309
going to get mad about the stuff going
on but just temporary it is just a

264
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,039
little while

265
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:55,669
alright but you get mad again let's stop
the stuff is just a temporary solution

266
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:01,809
there's no end as we were stuck in icy
that possibly happening again and again

267
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:10,100
but there's only some hope to avoid the
San scanners you can opt out it's

268
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,389
actually something I do all the time I
don't know how many people actually

269
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:17,859
realize this but I go to the TSA start
walking through the line and i watch

270
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:19,669
another sending me to medicine doctor

271
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:25,220
gonna catch mph I had it or the scanner
device in Device either gonna see me

272
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,690
through the scanner I get up there in
like I am going to opt out of 10 on the

273
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,809
airport if I gotta wait you know I'm in
order to you or whatever but the call

274
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,489
somebody over me through the side to the
hand on the back thing and I'm like

275
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,760
sweet tea later that's it I guess it's
my little wave

276
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,110
are protesting or whatever least the
fact that he got a touch me up and down

277
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:52,650
I'm sure doesn't make them to you happy
so whatever give it to the man still

278
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:59,450
there to civil services what about civil
services we're going to focus on we're

279
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,990
talking about water gas electricity
sewage waste services in internet so I'm

280
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,130
other core things that we have in our
everyday life that we've always had too

281
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,180
soon they're always going to be there
you know I think it's become a buzzword

282
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:20,050
an hour too much stated systems and all
that but get same thing so it's obvious

283
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:27,430
there should be vulnerable but you
really consider the impacts in society

284
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,560
if any of these things were going to
kind of go bad and I want to make a

285
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,150
really quick note on this intervention
electromagnetic pulse where to go off

286
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,470
whether from nuclear whatever United
States it would take about 15 years to

287
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,070
rebuild the basic infrastructure and I'm
not talking about you refrigerators or

288
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,760
you know your your power to your house
and you know central air I'm talking

289
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,120
about the central substations that
transmit power from one area to the

290
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,850
other

291
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,310
the reason why is because you put my my
hard work goes down or bricks will I

292
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,060
need something to build it but if that
busted I need something to build this

293
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,920
thing that just busted to build the
building you know you get the idea that

294
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,480
chain reaction and we would be able to
manufacture these replacement parts for

295
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,010
the substations we have to you have to
do it overseas have it shipped here

296
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,890
having been sent to the place and
installed and that life cycle over just

297
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,120
read that would take about fifty years
got a crazy so why would these things

298
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,680
happen

299
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,570
breaking down about three things attack
so imagine we're talking with these

300
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,550
different things

301
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,460
and you guys might be coming after me or
my I am i becoming a few were two

302
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:44,260
warring states and lets you in a
stalemate you're getting forces a look

303
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,850
at me I'm looking at you guys if I can
go in and do any kind of disruptions

304
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,620
whether it's still lecture electricity
or maybe it's going into the sewage

305
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,350
backup all the sewage all peoples houses
in a flooded with this filthy and

306
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,680
disgusting stuff as it gets into the
water supply when I get a deal with

307
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,060
pissed off citizens are going what the
heck's going on tonight you're forced

308
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,250
your focus is diverted you gotta watch
your people make sure they're happy

309
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,760
while you've also got the threat of me
coming after you or you don't even know

310
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,540
that I'm coming all your focus is now on
is getting on your citizens from making

311
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,030
them happy and I can come in and take
you over a better way to be chained that

312
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:22,250
what if I do something where your sewage
backed up but then I disable your

313
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,020
electricity or gas so you no longer have
the ability for people to boil the water

314
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:32,390
to make a clean again are you really in
trouble and Internet yeah I guess all

315
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:40,030
the kids but nobody would know what to
do and besides attack we look at natural

316
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,770
disasters things happen all the time
that we can't control you know and then

317
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,060
also I'm sure that's never happened
we've run up something into a tree near

318
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,150
taking out stuff you know what the idea
is to think about these things that the

319
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,620
possible they can happen and what would
happen to you are you would you even

320
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,260
know what to do if any of those things
went down for an extended period of time

321
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,730
alright so this is another one little
thing so who's familiar with what

322
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:14,730
distribution chain is or how it works ok
ok distribution change the idea what

323
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:21,030
we're looking at here is what he really
thinks Coke or Pepsi or something I'm

324
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:27,300
sure whatever so lets a coca-cola
manufacturers some coke coke at their

325
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,080
plant and they got to get it to you so
the idea with the distribution chain is

326
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,260
re to manufacture buys it

327
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,580
her gosh yeah they make it a warehouse
buys it just shipped to them and that

328
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,500
warehouse then sends it to the store

329
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,030
so that's going to do the distribution
chain from use and consumer to

330
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:54,370
manufacture originally and we went with
the idea where I want to buy something i

331
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,580
buy in bulk so I'm gonna buy noodles I
would say I need to have boxes of

332
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,900
noodles and now in Meijer warehouse
they've got at the store they've gotten

333
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,000
to her boxes a noodle sitting there well
if certainly some health report comes

334
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,010
out this as noodles are bad for you

335
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,740
well nobody gonna buy those noodles now
gotta sit on and they're gonna sit there

336
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,120
gonna go bad and you just kind of you
know go to waste

337
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,480
well one more came around and we can win
to this new age where they created

338
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,480
something called a police call
just-in-time delivery or shipping and

339
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,260
the concept is every single store hold
no more food or supplies danny's but for

340
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,690
for three days three days milk three
days a serial three years or whatever

341
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,750
because if I keep selling it I don't
have to worry about spoilage you know I

342
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,130
can keep my profits you know hikes are
not to worry about stuff getting run out

343
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,670
if this thing goes out of style can
replace it really quick but that leads

344
00:27:50,670 --> 00:28:00,420
to problems lots of problems so good
example would be a big snow storm came

345
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,610
through I can actually call us some snow
may get into whatever you think they've

346
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,380
never seen snow before but this happens
something happens people start freaking

347
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,310
out all the store shelves are going
there

348
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:17,600
archer let's hear that guy you like ok I
need to go buy buy everything to hold up

349
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,080
for this

350
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,580
the snow storm that's coming will would
you if you hold out your supplies are

351
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,440
gone

352
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,940
ok I need to go home or go buy more the
store well it's been more than three

353
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,000
days people have already been hoarding
and you know buying everything so i cant

354
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,360
buy food at the store who are you gonna
do what happens if ya sure snow storm

355
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,150
comes to maybe a bridge or something
goes down to the no longer the trucks

356
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:47,100
can come in to reply to store shelves do
you think about that for just assume

357
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:57,260
that there's always gonna be food or
you're gonna get supplies going into

358
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:03,120
this saying this is bad this is bad
whatever world falling apart but the den

359
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,700
go here is that whatever they want to
look at you being prepared

360
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:18,180
thinking these things through having a
game plan of how to react if so and this

361
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,380
is part of the reason why i'm talking
you guys' I see it one of the first keys

362
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,730
is empowering other people to take
control them to take care of themselves

363
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:34,260
for that would be pretty things a
greater threat because prepared for the

364
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,919
guy is unprepared

365
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:46,040
yeah exactly but we have food and you
don't

366
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,230
having got nothing to lose you gonna
come after me and chances are you

367
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,570
willing to die or kill me kiss her
chance of survival

368
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,160
the guys prepared changes are unified in
before things went bad now we're gonna

369
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,910
be BFFs cuz he's ready I'm ready and if
there's a threat

370
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:09,500
chances are we can help each other out
there are two general populace and how

371
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,620
they're going to react around you where
you live

372
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,220
it's gonna be different different
situations call for different things and

373
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,060
I really don't like this idea how just
generalize everybody there it is gonna

374
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:27,040
go blindly you know like mindless crazy
hoard yeah sure some places like that

375
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,340
you went to the concert called the 2010
World which are really like and talk

376
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,390
about how in a crisis 10 people are
gonna run towards safety 10 people are

377
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,550
gonna run directly into danger and the
rest of the eighty people in the middle

378
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,920
are gonna follow one of the other you
obviously want to be the Department 10%

379
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,640
that is is running towards safety and
part of that is prepared for preparing

380
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,740
yourself into thinking he's doing
through mentally good example Katrina

381
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,230
and the sport's down I don't know how
many guys you been really followed that

382
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:05,110
too much remember but a whole lot of
people were like listening to the

383
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,710
government about going to play so come
here you be safe will take care of you

384
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,970
give you food water and shelter will
they go to this place

385
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,440
get locked in there on our food water
and other basic necessities third more

386
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,840
left abandoned nobody can get to them
and it turned into a huge to catastrophe

387
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,710
at this point look to any part in the
middle I don't know how many people

388
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,600
really affected by that I don't you know
people really died I just it was just so

389
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,110
bad I just was like yeah I hear that was
really weird talking about cannibalism

390
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:41,560
now so if you're not familiar with this
your body can survive for think it's

391
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:48,640
three days without water and 21 days
without food but we say 21 days without

392
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,870
food we're talking your dad not as you
know I really like a kit kat bar we're

393
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,890
talking like you are freaking dead

394
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:01,020
if you look at history doesn't matter
how advanced civilization is what you

395
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:07,140
said about 12 to 14 days that
civilization will turn a cannibalism I

396
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:12,050
guess we just turning does i'm used from
fictional account of reality here so you

397
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,470
know your your you get your food you're
good to go

398
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,970
your neighbor runs out of food kind of
weird think they're gonna try to give

399
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:24,500
each other and maybe you just gonna
survive if you thought you know but it's

400
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,770
alright so you're saying we need to do
is have a strategy have a game plan here

401
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:36,670
in a couple weeks ago I had a lot of fun
with with it with his kind of class

402
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:42,190
training thing and what you were wanting
people to learn how to project

403
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,380
management group about people and we're
talking to people in their sixties

404
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,700
fifties forty's whole campaign to get
people to office workers in a man woman

405
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,970
and my team consisted of an old lady
expire mid-fifties gray hair you know

406
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,470
couple of the random people and their
the television the other table 2 ok come

407
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,920
up with a project that you want to build
some lady says oh yeah we want to plan

408
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,790
up birthday party for eight-year-old

409
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,930
says let's build a garden some other
person says all the plan my wedding I

410
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,130
just turned my table and I'm like a
zombie survival apocalypse planning and

411
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,030
they did it was actually a lot of fun we
are spending the night the next hour

412
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,740
going through filling this project
change template it was awesome because

413
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,710
we're figuring out things like I was
actually gonna be included in this

414
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,070
who is outside the scope we we figured
the instructors were outside the scope

415
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:42,330
of we're gonna save ya was great because
we're talking to cover everything and I

416
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,580
guarantee you a normal life would have
thought of this but I've never seen

417
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,310
something so formal written up by then
we cover everything from like brisk

418
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:55,090
deliverables the scope it was good I
we're not going to care about what

419
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,480
happens after year after the zombie
Apocalypse starts but from the day it

420
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,610
happens we want to figure out how to
survive from their of up to one year so

421
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,350
a lot of fun

422
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,780
so how can you and I look at this and
figure out what it what do we do four

423
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,460
things play a little wonder if you start
until you start thinking these things

424
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,690
out what could possibly happen you're
not really gonna know how to prepare for

425
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,530
it and any other days you can prepare
for everything he did try going to look

426
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,850
like those you all this crazy prepper
guys on TV

427
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,830
we're awesome bunkers . they can have a
normal conversation because they were

428
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,710
trying to think the stuff to do too much

429
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,740
strategy the first thing you really want
to figure out where to go and is gonna

430
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,060
be different for every scenario in Chile
on your basement hiding is not a good

431
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,960
solution I can't think of anything that
that that any situation is really kind

432
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,119
of a good idea

433
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:54,330
2000 well damage yes ok tornadoes how do
you base it was the Sharks I don't know

434
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,190
if that would change things up

435
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:05,660
alright so after you figure out where
you gonna go you are going to get their

436
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,920
shit foot bike skateboard i mean you
really think these things because they

437
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,080
guarantee saying oh it's bad but getting
your car everybody's thinking the exact

438
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,010
same thing going to be stuck in with
them just thinking these these detainees

439
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:26,260
things out makes all the difference in
the world one really cool I'll give this

440
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,060
week in ivory variants are doing it but
I guess they started doing in the

441
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:35,359
walking dead so we can cover it but
these guys talked about how is you

442
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,710
really need to get around to get from
city to city doing is the main highways

443
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,270
kids are gonna be covered with people
that are freaking out just getting in

444
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,340
their cars it's gonna be a lot of
obstacles and you can't receiver fire

445
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,750
but train tracks when you get from Citi
acct be perfect with a couple people on

446
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,050
guys up there maybe you know like five
yards I can guys back on the other side

447
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,380
you know you basically spread out you've
got good coverage if you sensed danger

448
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,220
averages kinda hides

449
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,210
but your passes really clear you're not
really going to be challenged too much

450
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,700
but I don't know after you know the
walking dead and you know who knows

451
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:12,010
every time I start doing that now
showing items you're gonna need and i

452
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,370
actually place that

453
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,320
farther down on the list but before we
start figure out what we want to buy

454
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,760
really laughing at me like a bag for
your stuff no I just hope everything in

455
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,850
my pocket

456
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:33,840
guys should have blown up bigger ok so
care I love these guys and they're

457
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,050
actually not more and they're actually a
retired military guys they ought to go

458
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,600
through in reviewed year and everything
from backpacks to you know i think im to

459
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,720
get even go to weapons and all that but
it's a great place to find out what

460
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,470
actually works and what doesn't cause
nowadays you buy everything online and

461
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,540
it's nice to know that there's people
going out there trying this stuff is he

462
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,440
getting a backpack or something that
doesn't really work doesn't fit in there

463
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,010
really break things down pack
specifically I love this company I don't

464
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,880
know how you if you pronounce the key
from you something but they make their

465
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,850
packs her percent american-made again X
military guys that have been in the fuel

466
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,960
they know what works what doesn't make
incredible stuff is the most durable

467
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,760
stuff of ever running to go to PAX

468
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,420
bug out bag and a go bag you might have
heard this in different terms as welders

469
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,570
they call them get out of Dodge bags or
go to hell bags

470
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,140
suggests that the same concept I break
it down the difference being a bug out

471
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,860
bag is something that's big enough to
hold enough supplies for you for 72

472
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,970
hours to get from where you're at

473
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:46,630
you whatever rally pointer here at work
right and something happens you gotta

474
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,140
get home

475
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,890
well that bug out bag should have enough
supplies so that you can get home within

476
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:56,710
72 hours if you can hit by car vs enough
to to get you by where you're going bag

477
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,060
is your long-term pact has got
everything to get your long-term

478
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,570
destination was kind of cool is if you
do your setup right you can actually

479
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,640
attach your bug out bag to your goal
bank so if you really need to drop your

480
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,540
stuff in Iran use drop it grabbed a
little bag and go to use an example in

481
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,370
the left of

482
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:18,940
love bug out bag would look like and
then you're right he's your go bag I

483
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,680
pick that pic most bugger banks which
are on the left are actually can be a

484
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,760
little bit smaller but I like this one
specifically because of the color this

485
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,260
color foliage and I like it because it
looks like pretty standard pack now only

486
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,820
does it blend in well if you're out in
the wild in the woods but if I gotta go

487
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,460
into an urban environment that looks
like a standard package you know so many

488
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:48,110
to be doing some camping with it if I in
that city and I'm running out of

489
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,420
supplies and I see some people they
could be potential targets I see these

490
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,300
two guys walk in you know maybe a little
bit apart but I gotta choose between

491
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,330
these two guys which one do you think
I'd rather go for that think he's got

492
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:05,380
more supplies are you might actually
have more expensive gear on the right to

493
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,040
i mean he's got some kind of camel their
looks like oh you must have some kind of

494
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,010
cool tactical stuff should target him
obviously well in this case the pacs

495
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,770
Biggers I was going to run slower but
the leftist activist and a backpack you

496
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:25,330
know that this is that when I'm going to
the coolest of all the things that you

497
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,750
might wanna start hoarding in the event
of something happens in again I couldn't

498
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,970
really find the original source to this
is something that I ran into an early

499
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,480
two thousands but I think this list was
compiled based off of information from

500
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,710
the sea Serio war and some survivors and
they really went through what

501
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,690
disappeared for an actual even some
priorities and you know I actually do

502
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,910
have a hundred on here but I think we
would start losing our minds of you

503
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,140
start going through everything but i
wanna hit up here so you can look at it

504
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,260
because when I started collecting stuff
that I thought the important to me

505
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,630
or would be valuable to a lot of people
it was very different than what I sexual

506
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:06,250
assault on this list and I don't know if
you can read this but generators not

507
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,240
really good idea yes we for power but if
you wanna start broadcasting your

508
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,310
attention or people's attention that
you're there and attract zombies you

509
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,890
know you don't want to use those
expected batteries 2012 top items on

510
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:24,580
here but it actually made about numbers
38 on this list actually any weapons

511
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,620
weapons me it's a number seven on the
list in expected that to be hired you

512
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,360
would surprise me is usually like honey

513
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:38,680
serb sweet things out like number 899

514
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,920
things like what vegetable oil survival
guide book is 17

515
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,020
a washboard mop bucket wringer at lower
level 20 number twenty I don't know the

516
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,260
last time so he's done laundry manually
at least in the past couple decades at

517
00:40:53,260 --> 00:41:03,350
least I haven't so you have more garbage
bag 29 alright so I'm not gonna go

518
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,750
through all of these here

519
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,690
duct tape 53 that surprised me to expect
it to be a little bit higher he's duct

520
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:22,309
tape for anything more

521
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:26,439
the last 10 here but if you want to
check this out do more detail reading

522
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,660
that's the Euro

523
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:35,189
oh ok there is making a comment re I was
surprised that he was going through she

524
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:37,499
can relate number of hundred

525
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:41,259
am I missing something

526
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:47,130
know you those be like like number two
for you

527
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,019
number one alright I'm sorry Pete
nightmare

528
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:58,559
ok yes so check it out there is actual
even more commentary about some of these

529
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,349
survivors and what they say what's
really important like they point out the

530
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:06,660
fact that no matter how the longer war
drags out the less and less gold

531
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,140
actually has lost her inability to
people and they will trade anything for

532
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,839
you no decency humanitarian humanitarian
items like toilet paper and you know

533
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,229
Kelowna just things to make you feel
like a human again so alright we talked

534
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:23,579
about a lot of stuff regarding you know
I need this but we've never really

535
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:26,489
talked about kinda high tech stuff and
I'm talking about basic survival stuff

536
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:30,979
but let's be honest we're a bunch of
nerds we like tech I think we'd lose our

537
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:34,799
minds are stuck in a situation where we
had to survive a single piece of

538
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:38,759
computer hardware to play with so so
just a couple things I wanted to touch

539
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:40,420
with that because in interest

540
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,900
there's no way to see our yeah you need
this you need that all the stuff we're

541
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:48,289
talking about is specialized for your
situation where you want to go so

542
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:51,900
anybody tells you you know by his kid
got everything you need

543
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,400
don't believe it was getting generic
stuff that doesn't mean it's what you

544
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,769
need so couple things to consider what
what kind of equipment do you do you

545
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:00,689
really need it

546
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:04,939
you want to be carrying like a
twenty-pound laptop in your bag that guy

547
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:09,789
like a two hour charge on it that's
gonna suck I'd say just don't know more

548
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:12,719
about it so consider the types of stuff
you're taking with you maybe it's not

549
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,549
gonna be portable baby is going to be
stationary think about this stuff arena

550
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:22,029
powered you say I'm gonna do solar while
you're on the move now you gotta add

551
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:24,759
solar panels to your pack the stuff adds
up

552
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:28,849
believe it or not this stuff gets really
had a really fast I think you

553
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:33,989
never hear about 260 pounds is the
maximum weight a male adult in his prime

554
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:36,789
sure probably carrying on his back and
think more you can have run into serious

555
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:43,529
you back problems for caring and
protecting and are ya gonna story you

556
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:46,930
know he was going through your bag you
know get banged up but shielding that's

557
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,809
something that I think about you know
the reason I haven't bought a Kindle yet

558
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:54,289
excitement run into one that's gotta be
shielding on it the last thing I want to

559
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:57,710
do is learn my books on it are reading
and if something goes on to lose all my

560
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:04,029
books you know you don't have to spend
thousands of dollars on EMP shielding

561
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:08,329
also known as a high-spirited kidder's
there's a concept known as poor man's

562
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:13,329
Verde shielding where a good example
would be let's say for some reason you

563
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:17,289
think you're gonna be necessary or
helpful after the end of World put a

564
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:22,539
ziploc bag then you wrap with aluminum
foil completely so there's no gaps when

565
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:27,039
you put another black bag aluminum foil
again and you one more time to get out

566
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,979
three layers of Ziploc bags and aluminum
foil and the theory is that should

567
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:36,599
reflect enough of a burst going off that
it won't fryer electronic components

568
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,979
inside of that downside to that is
obviously you can use it to get inside

569
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:44,569
all the stuff and if you keep opening
and closing it you know it it starts

570
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:49,119
breaking down wearing so you can kind of
before things go bad you keep it all

571
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,259
sealed up and ready to go after things
go bad all right now you access it from

572
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:59,920
getting the comms and its noting that we
don't really I don't think people think

573
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,479
about how many times did something
happen where a disaster happens you try

574
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:06,729
to contact somebody else and you dont
you can't get through all circuits are

575
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:14,589
busy things are overloaded i'm looking
for to suggestions here on reliable coms

576
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:18,200
that you think you could used contact
somebody or maybe the people your loved

577
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,539
ones in the event of an emergency where
you just need to you know get older

578
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:23,930
people

579
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:34,800
ham radio gear pitch it also might you
did you know I thought the second one

580
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:44,500
actually what's a five-minute alright
alright so ham radio I'm curious to know

581
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,050
to in the event of an EMP blass going
off how that would affect transmissions

582
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,650
for the hammer to say no it doesn't

583
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,850
bouncing sometimes and and all that but
secondary to that we're not actually

584
00:45:54,850 --> 00:46:01,810
cost a light their ground stations so
I'm not a physicist are not actually

585
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,780
know how you appear electromagnetic
fields you know go outside how they work

586
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,530
once they hit the atmosphere but if
you're these guys put the satellites up

587
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,540
there probably designed these things to
you have enough shielding to protect

588
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:20,420
them from these things need specialized
equipment typically but if you check

589
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,940
back to this Wired article that happened
back in 2009 was actually really big

590
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,590
deal we're back in Brazil all these
citizens found a way where they could

591
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:34,060
you know jack on to the FLT SATCOM
military UUs military satellites they

592
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,100
didn't use encryption at all to start
communicating with each other so they

593
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,820
were able to do this with about $100 an
hour to spare parts tying it into their

594
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,900
car radios you can actually go to a shop
have a non-technical guy he alright well

595
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,420
here's your radio Luca bunches

596
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,670
you know the copper wire together it's
just that frequency and now you can

597
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,940
communicate directly to that satellite
in a release it down anybody else was

598
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,980
music community with each other I like
that to you because if my equipment goes

599
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,220
Friday goes bad you know I can build
another one and I guarantee if a bunch

600
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,790
of non-technical people back in 2009 to
put this together for less than a

601
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:18,030
hundred bucks worth about hackers could
do and then I told the last thing I want

602
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,580
to kind of leave with you guys in this
matter how so bad as you think you are

603
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,680
on your own you know you can pull it off
your ramble

604
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,890
you know there's no comparison is
strength in numbers as you go through

605
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,970
the roof just by having one extra guy
with you you can't keep awake hundred

606
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:35,569
percent of the time

607
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:42,069
you can't watch your back on a per cent
of time so yeah the ultimate dream team

608
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:47,609
right there are still many questions

609
00:47:47,609 --> 00:48:02,849
yeah I know it's incredible it's
incredible that in there and not only

610
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:08,099
that but I'm like how do I follow up
with them so our guys thank you so much
