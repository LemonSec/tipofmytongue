1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,650
ok welcome this is my talk now this is
the path while only a smattering of

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,320
applause I i mean I'm honored

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:29,019
ok now it's just landed now this is my
talked up at well-traveled a few common

4
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:33,040
mistakes that have encountered with with
implementing some programs in various

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,770
environments I give a bit of a fair
warning in advance here first off there

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,590
is a minor seizure warning associated
with this talk there is a graphic later

7
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,800
on that if you are prone to epilepsy or
anything like they did with Pokemon way

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,510
back when

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:01:00,289
please don't sue me I have blanket
things also on a more personal note I

10
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,119
tend to be a bit egotistical as some of
my coworkers can attest oh I am

11
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,400
extremely talented up really am also
extremely self deprecating and I have

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,540
some experience with which again is all
up to debate I've been working in the

13
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:26,990
industry four or five years specifically
jumping in with monitoring technologies

14
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:33,670
and Tricia probably on my interests lie
for that which is this is my name a lot

15
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,350
of Nick Jakobi memories prime on Twitter
I currently work at hurricane labs as

16
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:48,050
they're tuning sock QA engineer I guess
we were never really clear on the title

17
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,120
but a few things about me I like I said
I've been working in the industry for

18
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,590
about four years I've been working with
seems like she radar le involved I don't

19
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,270
know do you consider security onion
thing it was a fun tools like a Fisher

20
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,400
Price my first sam there is only
involves I currently work and work with

21
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,780
Splunk enterprise security PCI and
hurricanes own in-house laps in my free

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,700
time a martial artist I have been
practicing most of my life now actually

23
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,930
I do boxing and sword fighting as well
and those are fun things and the other

24
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,410
free time activities I tend to be a
snake Wrangler and occasional pirate and

25
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,970
despite what Jason Street would have you
believe

26
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,340
being a pirate is not a fall back from
being at from failing to be a ninja

27
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,080
they're better so I would like to

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,380
as well it is fun to jump on people but
normally I would be delivering this talk

29
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,240
with a bit more enthusiasm I apologize
for that bit of a cold so the question

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,210
is going to seem kind of out of place
but why is this goofy bastard so excited

31
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,900
well because I like talking about stuff
like this I like helping people improve

32
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,720
on what they on the security controls
that they've got in their environment

33
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,800
and I hope it and I enjoy seeing a
monitoring program succeed over simply

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,040
continuing and failing to do anything
which brings us to a few points what is

35
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,380
said well that's what the acronym means
but under most circumstances you're

36
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,500
going to be discussing appliances and
there is there are quite a few of those

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,440
how many people here working in work
either as a consultant or internally and

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,400
having the same appliance in their
environment

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,040
damn that is actually a better ratio and
I think I've ever seen given when giving

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,070
the stop

41
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,280
do any of you guys have any particular
favorites amongst them or do oldest and

42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,420
the ones you work on I don't actually
know what people's opinions are any more

43
00:03:52,420 --> 00:04:00,500
Indian particulars

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,730
count as a similar thought was a fair
enough

45
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,150
fair enough I've had two radar in solar
wind butt heads like you wouldn't

46
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,799
believe

47
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:19,410
spectacular so we've got things like
IBM's cue radar got really involved

48
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,760
you've got votes free version which is
like a mixing it up as a DOS Equis and

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,280
I'll send thank you you have enterprise
security and the PCI apps on Splunk I

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,380
guess but why tell you this

51
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,229
well frankly because when I started out
with this I too had to learn it because

52
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:45,840
understanding that what I same can be
used for really tells you what you could

53
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,389
what kind of problems will be facing
when you with with that level of

54
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,090
understanding you've got a you know some
of the variations in the appliances

55
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,930
there's also a right

56
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:08,440
logarithm ArcSight that's the one I keep
forgetting thank you come again I never

57
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,840
got a chance to work with that one

58
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,099
I want to though most because I haven't
and people tend to have questions about

59
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:20,300
the ones that I always have it work with
so we'll dive into a few of the mistakes

60
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,950
that I faced and first one that one that
tends to stand up first and foremost

61
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,590
especially with people that have never
dealt with Sam which if you been a

62
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,270
consultant you probably had to deal with
that first mistake is believing a sim to

63
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:47,570
be a tumor turnkey solution so lovely
Google stock images to deal with a lot

64
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,260
of clients that believe simply by
putting the same place they are suddenly

65
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,700
secure and nothing will get to them

66
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:01,080
it's a it's a common executive mentality
it's a common tool based mentality

67
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,840
obviously it's an incorrect one
otherwise people wouldn't be here in

68
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,270
order to get any value out of it a sim
requires careful understanding and

69
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:18,460
knowledge of what it can actually pull
off what you can do with with Splunk

70
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,240
basic is different than what you can do
with Splunk es mentally ill text but

71
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:31,240
point being the thing that most people
tend to not realize that a sim is not

72
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:39,710
instant use one size fits all or a small
investment I've seen a lot of people

73
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,480
that want to throw the minimal amount of
money for the smallest license of insert

74
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,780
name of same here and hope to get the
same value as a multi-million dollar

75
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,430
program that somebody's been developing
over years it doesn't necessarily work

76
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,440
in that same bright you don't
necessarily need that multi-million

77
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,950
dollar investment if your company isn't
really that big you need to understand

78
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:10,300
exactly what what would be the optimal
usage so that you can actually maximize

79
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,190
how much money you're spending banning
you from either during these the scorn

80
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:24,529
of your financial department or from
Google

81
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:31,849
having to explain why you're not getting
the maximum value out of it so and

82
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:35,919
definitely not just a matter of throwing
it throwing money at that technology

83
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,639
it's it's going to take time it's going
to take that understanding which brings

84
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:49,309
us to the second mistake which is
frankly the biggest one that I've ever

85
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:55,959
encountered that would be not applying
the appropriate manpower I've

86
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,499
encountered in the terms of being a
consultant which have been for a number

87
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:05,249
of years now I've encountered situations
where because of the nature of how

88
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:09,569
monitoring works one of the problems a
lot of consulting companies get into is

89
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,079
ok we just need to alert when there's
actually an event to learn about not

90
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,479
actually inappropriate mentality on the
questionnaire value which then leads

91
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,909
them to well can't we have Joe the
intern do your job for you we can

92
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,489
guarantee you Joe the Internet is no
longer working in the security space and

93
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:31,429
a very cynical about this point because
I know Joe the internet somewhere in the

94
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:38,959
security space was a good guy so as I
said was not a small investment requires

95
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:49,440
understanding and Charlie cooperation 10
points anybody get that reference

96
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,630
so there there's one guy back there
shaking his head like where did I go

97
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,070
wrong

98
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:04,810
not even the crickets I know right but
I'll I have no interest so to hell with

99
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,560
the LA area so it's the time not just
for the installation before the tuning

100
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,900
required in order to optimize your
simple app for its the understanding

101
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,300
knowing what exactly everything that
goes on in the same does what's going on

102
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,540
in the environment what is the
environment look like it's the

103
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,700
cooperation between not just the
security team not just the monitoring

104
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,560
team not just that staff but everybody
that would be involved in this you have

105
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,470
to get by off from pay policy guys if I
see this kind of activity

106
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,920
what do i do I've worked in a financial
company where basically I was not the

107
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,530
one that ended up chasing down people I
was a little bit handed off here's my

108
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:50,130
report on what I found sick the house on
them that didn't happen either which is

109
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,620
another story but having that
cooperation between those teams having

110
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,770
that understanding of the environment
and knowing what you're looking at is

111
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,260
tantamount to optimizing the
effectiveness of the same product

112
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:08,000
delivering that amount of time not
expecting those instantaneous results

113
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,160
you will get one of the big things and
any developer should press this point

114
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,230
when you plug and IDs or anything of
that nature into your environment you're

115
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,340
gonna see things that you've never seen
before you gonna have knowledge that

116
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,550
you've never known existed in your
environment that's a good thing you want

117
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,930
to have the knowledge that you didn't
know existed in your environment but not

118
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,080
all of its gonna be useful right away

119
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,260
not all of its going to be completely
it's not gonna all be painter for that

120
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,250
level of cooperation you gotta remember
signing the wrong sport can be as

121
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,630
damaging is not a signing support if you
have people that want to sound the alarm

122
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:59,110
blow the horns and chase down every
single little thing right away then

123
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,770
they're going to rapidly become burnt
out they're going to rapidly become the

124
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:08,140
enemy of everybody in the organization
as they reveal every little secret in

125
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,230
there and frankly how many people have
dealt with coworkers that don't really

126
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,260
like the fact that there is somebody
that is loading the fact that they're

127
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:21,940
watching everything they do in their
organization who actually I'm realizing

128
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,430
now that I'm in a room of people that
all utilize that you guys are all in

129
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:31,000
that are in that position but my point
is how many of your coworkers like the

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,150
fact that they know that you're looking
over their shoulder exactly but nobody

131
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,590
likes that

132
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,640
he's also really tall so nobody really
looks over shoulder but remember like I

133
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:51,850
said about Joe the intern and experience
to help can be overwhelmed it can be it

134
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,980
can be earnestly defeated by it

135
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,020
what they'll see what they tried to take
on and all the fights though have with

136
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,170
all the other internal staff or external
staff going on in the environment as

137
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:10,090
they try to tackle every single issue
they see right from the get-go which

138
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:17,350
will go into on that note of following
up on the learning there's the following

139
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,130
up on it when you plug your obviously
going to see a ton of things frankly

140
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,440
it's going there based on correlation of
ants so there's tons of that going on

141
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,550
everywhere there's tons of things that
look suspicious there are servers that

142
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,990
send email there are things that people
log into that

143
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,840
hey turns out people occasionally get
passwords and the symbol more than

144
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:51,270
likely alert on all of those now
understanding that to 95 to 98 percent

145
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,580
of those in the beginning are going home
entirely be false positives

146
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,970
there are certain ones you probably
should be ready to take up on to follow

147
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,580
up and this is one of the things that as
a consultant you have to be aware of

148
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,740
such a going to be going to an
environment saying hey what are some of

149
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,030
the key problems that you've had so that
we know where to start

150
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,240
cause we're gonna have a lot of garbage
to begin to deal with right in the

151
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,650
beginning

152
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,850
having that idea of a starting point
tells you where you should what you

153
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,560
should avoid what you should avoid for
the record not following up on learning

154
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,410
does have a fun counterpart which is
following up on too many things when you

155
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,050
taking on too many events and once
you're going to end up making enemies

156
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,120
you're gonna end up wasting your time
you're going to end up wasting everybody

157
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,520
else's time before you know what people
stopped returning your calls people stop

158
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,570
taking it seriously and then they stop
start wondering why they even spent the

159
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:50,870
money on the technology in the first
place and this is a clear matter of

160
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,960
perspective now this is a fun track and
this is like one of the things about me

161
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,140
being estate person that like its a
similar issue that we see in the

162
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,000
security community is just a matter of
perspective this is the same toy but if

163
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,780
you've ever seen a picture of a guy with
a really big fish that's holding it this

164
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:14,640
way without fish is only in that same
instance you have to get people to see

165
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,270
to understand the story that you want
them to hear you have to get them to see

166
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:28,050
the value in what you're doing and see
them and see exactly what you want when

167
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,840
you're delivering this report to them so
what may seem like a big deal to you

168
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:42,360
what may seem like it's really valuable
for you to follow up on may not in the

169
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,160
case of his superiors there was a
company that I was working for where we

170
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,870
are being bought out and a lot of people
are about to lose their jobs the

171
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,750
financial company as I mentioned before

172
00:14:53,750 --> 00:15:02,020
we while I was watching the same and I
saw somebody sending about the right

173
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:11,220
amount of data for say a quantitative
report to their own file share oh this

174
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,600
person was a quantitative analyst that's
what they did was did math stuff with

175
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,240
money in order to make the company more
money but when we started talking to us

176
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,330
this wasn't enough this wasn't enough of
this wasn't big enough for it to be a

177
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:34,690
mp3 or anything of that nature he tried
claiming it was a podcast and nobody

178
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,110
followed up on the fact that no dude
this he's he's doing this to like what

179
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,740
was it

180
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,770
end of the inter dotnet was the website
he was uploading this file too and it

181
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,460
turned out to be exactly the same size
as everything else that I had looked

182
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,950
into in their file share for really
sensitive data it seem like a big deal

183
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:03,850
to me but to the people that actually
enforce the policies not so much and

184
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,060
that was a big part of a big part of the
problem with dealing with that skirt

185
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,960
with that from the security standpoint
internally so you have to be able to

186
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,770
prove the value and what you're showing
it also when the helpdesk starts out all

187
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,810
nice and friendly with you and you've
sent them on so many wild goose chases

188
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:34,420
that they end up talking to like this
please send them after every little

189
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,630
event you're not one of the ones that
helps look that up they're going to

190
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,660
start

191
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:46,540
was hunting yet done goofed you don't
want every interaction with the help

192
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,100
desk to look like a battle between the
two of you

193
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,350
cool is that maybe I know we all want to
get into sword fights in the office

194
00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:04,730
place there but you don't actually want
that between you and help us you want to

195
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,590
be able to utilize them as your
harbingers of news and have them

196
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:16,810
understand exactly when you speak to
them they gotta take that seriously so

197
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:24,630
forth mistake of working with working
within tuning assembly is incorrectly

198
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,680
loading loading it or configuring which
also deals with one of the things I

199
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,060
mentioned earlier not knowing the
environment if you don't know exactly

200
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,700
what's going what each server does you
don't let me rephrase that you don't

201
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,150
need to know every single server in some
instances that is damn near impossible

202
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:52,260
but if you don't have a good idea of
what a general use of those servers are

203
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:00,470
you going to be trying to do things with
it you gonna be trying to cover up

204
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,180
information without having the facts
behind it

205
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,940
to justify covering it up and one of the
first things that a lot of companies

206
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,210
that have seen do and doing correctly
they don't really deal with the flood of

207
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,560
information so they plug it in

208
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,540
forward all other laws over turn it on
again and then deal with the flood of

209
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,980
information just like a punch to the
face there are a ton of alerts

210
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,730
monologues and there's a ton of noise
turns out you're not going to get much

211
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,620
done when you're dealing with something
like that so one of the things that

212
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:45,770
becomes a bit of a problem and i've seen
in some organizations is when I say

213
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,900
incorrectly configuring it specifically
mean not tuning alarms now when I spoke

214
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,070
my epilepsy warning earlier I literally
meant this because when I originally

215
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:02,400
gave this talk it was in a dark room
with no lights and everybody just kind

216
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,820
of had to deal with this one just gonna
go on that first cuz that's much more

217
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,380
pleasant I'm guessing but if you're not
quieting those alarms if you're not

218
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,170
doing anything to that then you're not
going to get the value of the same

219
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,700
you're not going to get your not going
to bring down that noise to signal ratio

220
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,770
that's one of the big things that to me
that needs to happen when you're

221
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:36,650
configuring that environment some of the
some of the big issues are you have so

222
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:43,050
many alerts that none of them have any
value and your staff that you've got on

223
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,020
your side that are interested in this
blanket box that you invested it put

224
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,620
most of them are but darkness this is
actually a negative thing towards that

225
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,310
they're gonna rapidly become very
disdainful of all that noise of the

226
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:04,070
email learning of the constant chatter
coming from it and you're going to get a

227
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:13,720
lot of this question going to get a lot
of what what the hell am one of the

228
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:20,260
things that I've asked for our business
for recently actually has been we deal

229
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,960
with a sock sir we have tickets that are
specifically designed for us our alerts

230
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,760
are designed to be read by our team and
they're like oh we want to have these

231
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,620
sent directly to us but he had no I
don't think you quite know what you're

232
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,450
asking for

233
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:43,340
do it ok I sent them to now keeping in
mind that we have a specific policy of

234
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,110
how we handle these how we filled out
these reports are literally ended up

235
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,800
getting a lot of this question of what
the heck out of these alerts

236
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,490
what are you doing for us exactly what
you asked for

237
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,390
actually but that's not the point point
is you don't know what you're looking at

238
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:07,170
you don't know how to read blog files
syslog you don't know how to do any of

239
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,370
this but you wanted to see it

240
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:18,100
and that ends up causing a bit of a
grading issue there and one of my

241
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,140
favorite mistakes actually of a sim
program I don't own throat kinda weird

242
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:30,410
but I guess at how cold is not utilizing
the operational capability of asset know

243
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,190
when you had mentioned SolarWinds
earlier and the reason that I didn't

244
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,980
that I was surprised that that answer
came up was i've seen the two of those

245
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,300
things actually butt heads like I said
in this instance somebody a

246
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,220
misconfigured a solar winds

247
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,260
SolarWinds instance and it was basically
tossing her domain controllers because

248
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,090
it was trying to due process monitoring
so frequently that we had to add

249
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,679
additional course all of our domain
controllers to keep up now

250
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,100
luckily on my end because that was not
my task was able to find out exactly

251
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:13,020
what was going on and prove it using a
listens to her but they also don't play

252
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:19,270
nicely in the fact that if you have any
any credentials or anything like that

253
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,690
set up properly

254
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,800
click to see a whole lot of logins from
things like solar wind you're going to

255
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,929
see a lot of problems like that and if
you're not using the same to chase down

256
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,160
some of those issues that you're missing
out on a lot of the value of what you

257
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:41,000
can do with and without a place as
powerful as a tool I mean frankly it

258
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,420
ends up becoming like a a moment of
scarring truth where you seen some

259
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,900
things as I said you're plugging in eyes
into the entire network you can see

260
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,780
everything that's going on

261
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:00,930
and some of it is horrible and some of
its kind of some of it really helps

262
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,750
tighten up the security posture of your
organization and some of it is kinda

263
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:12,290
useless and should probably be ignored
by having that understanding can help

264
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,290
you push for security changes that don't
require further investment that don't

265
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:22,670
require more technology that just
require a little better practice on the

266
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:28,880
side of your engineering staff in the
end even though you might butt heads

267
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,810
with some of the ops team or some of the
other engineers get a little like a nice

268
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:40,850
little interaction between the two of
you guys you guys can be friends right

269
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:48,150
so the

270
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:53,480
the sixth mistake is the one that I have
the hardest time convincing people to

271
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:00,710
follow up on and is the one that tends
to actually get me personally in the

272
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,610
most amount of trouble that's not
testing on any of the tuning that has

273
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,570
been performed now one of the big things
with this is i've had the courtesy of

274
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,320
working with some amazing red teamers
the pen test teams and some of the

275
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,190
organizations that are incredible

276
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:24,170
alright so involved

277
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,360
yeah I know the name means nothing to
most of you guys does this guy doesn't

278
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,850
come out here or anywhere really but if
you ever get the chance to meet Josh

279
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:40,330
little pick his brain was pretty good
but make a game of it and for those who

280
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,840
don't know because I actually had a
co-worker then get this this is DND it's

281
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,170
not a video this is Dungeons and Dragons
he did not get that that's what we're

282
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:54,510
talking about playing some point but
make a game of it one of the best

283
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,980
meetings that I've ever had was Josh
Derek and I sat in a room and set for

284
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,030
this is how I would check this that's
easy I do I use this port to get through

285
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,650
alright then we'll break this rule to
watch for any traffic looking like this

286
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:18,830
there was there was an earlier talked it
was the new inside and this distance is

287
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:25,870
that who spoke about noon or talk was
about exactly that taking take some of

288
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,560
the things if you have access to a pen
test team if you guys have access to a

289
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,540
community that does threat modeling that
does

290
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:39,399
CTS out some of those attackers and see
what steps of those attacks

291
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,009
you could actually improve your
detection capabilities on an even better

292
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:46,749
after you've done the tuning in your
environment or in your client's

293
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:51,119
environment follow-up and test this is
really cool when you got some

294
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,779
interactive clients at all like yeah ok
cool we got these controls in place

295
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,460
all right let's go through them and find
out if they work now I'm Italy I try to

296
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,330
be hopeful and I try to be an optimist
and say they're not trying to screw you

297
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:10,089
over and say well you didn't do your job
right I've had some clients that are

298
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:14,379
really cold but ok this don't work but
you know what I think I know why and

299
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:18,149
they hope you tweak those rules they'll
help you get their environment and work

300
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:23,249
with you order to actually get to the
best Park which is why I I personally

301
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:28,159
love rat model I love doing things like
that I love sitting down saying alright

302
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,909
this is an attack that recently happened
how did it occur how did

303
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:43,889
blanking so-and-so get the whose whatsit
but go through those figure out each

304
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:46,899
step of the attack and figure out what
kind of detective control you could put

305
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:51,649
in place that would utilize your semi
that's already there or could be logged

306
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:57,809
and read by the same in order to see it
happening and then tried out easy to

307
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:01,089
script these kinds of things how they do
it in the training courses all the time

308
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:07,599
for both IBM and four million volt so
push those roles to the limit I mean

309
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,979
really push them to the limit also if
you've never had this done do you

310
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:18,859
actually hurts but you got it

311
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:24,519
you've got to be willing to really go
and see just what those thresholds are

312
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:33,379
maybe maybe it's not necessary to alert
on every single failed logon those ones

313
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:39,719
at two in the morning are kind of weird
are those ones from users that like

314
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:44,830
obviously da counts find out the ways
that you can get around those alerts and

315
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:53,659
see what you can do to alert so be
creative when you don't have to admit

316
00:27:53,659 --> 00:28:02,399
that you don't trust the person doing
the tuning but you know don't trust the

317
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,109
person doing the counting it's it's not
just about that trust relationship you

318
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:12,659
want to know that you've got that
integrity behind all the rules that

319
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,739
you've been putting it you want to know
that you're actually getting your

320
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:32,369
money's worth from the same that you put
all your money and time into so yeah I

321
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:35,479
kind of place through this because
unfortunately something personal came up

322
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:39,999
that I've got an answer call right after
this talk so we're gonna do a recap and

323
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:44,649
I can do you and I and i actually
encourage dialogue between either myself

324
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:49,710
feel free to call me out on anything I
say or if you had any instances of what

325
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,460
you've been doing with dealing with in
your environment I know when big things

326
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,229
that caused a big debate when I first
get this talk was discussing sales

327
00:28:57,229 --> 00:29:00,389
engineers and how they'll tell you that
simple solve everything from world

328
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:08,479
hunger to the target crisis after it's
already happened so so the basic recap

329
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:14,879
for the 616 certain mistakes that I've
encountered commonly are as follows

330
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,950
believing him to be a turnkey solution
dealing with exactly what Sales

331
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,190
Engineers well sales engineers sales
people will tell you Sales Engineers

332
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,500
tend to be a little more honest in my
opinion

333
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,380
but not applying the appropriate
manpower not following up on alerting or

334
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,610
following up on too much learning
incorrectly loading it not utilizing the

335
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,450
operational capacity of the same and not
testing the tuning that has been

336
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:51,850
performed so with that do I have any
questions do I have any comments and i

337
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,660
know i rushed through it and I am really
sorry this was kind of out of my control

338
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:27,610
I'm afraid yes I tend to prefer to have
a variety when I'm loading new sources

339
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,830
into a semi simply because even if it's
not entirely accurate simply because I

340
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,990
may have like one mail server one to
make the trailer fire while plugged in

341
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm at least getting a truer picture of
what happens in a network then I do when

342
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,340
I am getting just firewalls and i've
seen both situations where somebody

343
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:53,150
wanted load all the fire was into it but
what can you see I can see permits and

344
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:58,570
denies and that tends to give you a bit
of a muddy muddy image of what your

345
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,010
network X looks like it also prevents
you from tuning are reaching any kind of

346
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:08,110
operational pass capability with the
same especially early on in the cases of

347
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,840
my specialization tends to be curator
because I spent the most money time into

348
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,910
it is what I was introduced to but with
the ability to organize based on source

349
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:22,400
type so if you've got a fire while if
you've got mail server or anything of

350
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,230
that nature

351
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,450
you can organize those and prepare the
rules in advance and it doesn't matter

352
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,380
how many servers you've got in those
categories

353
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,290
if they are categorized properly
organized properly the rules can be

354
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:38,770
interpreted correctly and it and it just
kills to the size of the organization so

355
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:44,390
I tend to prefer having a variety of log
sources over having an abundance of a

356
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:48,920
single type simply because it allows me
to see a bit of a true picture of how

357
00:31:48,920 --> 00:32:21,500
traffic goes throughout the network so
one of the things that's been done like

358
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:28,380
a ass dildos use cases I can't stress
this enough it helps whenever you're

359
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,140
doing anything involving any thing
involving a business to have the

360
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,770
justification behind why you're doing
this whether it's building a new rule

361
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:44,310
following up on a new alert or why he's
directed controls are in place so figure

362
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,320
out like I said using those threat
models using those red team exercises

363
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,080
figure out how they got in figure out
what you can can what you can change and

364
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,660
what you'd be alerting on and yeah
document document document have all this

365
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,860
documentation in place so that you can
follow up and have the justification

366
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,000
behind what you're doing

367
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,960
yes

368
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:45,700
now that is in fact that argue that a
couple of these don't but you're

369
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,789
absolutely right his statement was there
is an inverse version of number five

370
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:53,309
where you have utilized the operational
capability of the simple to the point

371
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:55,320
where it's no longer actually

372
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,610
accurately collecting data aircraft
crashing collectors hear things are

373
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:07,070
parsing anymore you're wasting cycles
during this goes back to one in

374
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,480
correctly or incorrectly loading it
because said they're trying to do too

375
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,240
much and they did not actually get scale
to the inside and the environment they

376
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,260
need to be in and also probably not
applying appropriate manpower which

377
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:26,210
would help with identifying this and
turning this out early on here trying to

378
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,010
see every single thing and the
environment

379
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:38,000
well sorry that's that's going to be
really expensive that's going to be more

380
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,770
money than most organizations are really
want to apply into any kind of

381
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,720
technological undertaking let alone one
that somebody is going to have to sit

382
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,109
and read all the time now as far as
documentation for best

383
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:54,009
best practices for fine-tuning that
tends to be a bit individualistic

384
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:58,289
towards each environment that I've seen
some environments it would be far more

385
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:02,450
appropriate for certain changes to be in
place then there would be for others and

386
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,400
that tends to be my guiding light which
is why as a consultant it tends to be

387
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,609
figuring out what story that the
security team needs to tell in order to

388
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,739
get them to that point so that we can
continue moving forward with tuning so

389
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:40,509
I've had organizations that what was
that they wanted like a year's worth of

390
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:47,460
uncompressed logs and when we set out to
quote that out there like this would

391
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:58,549
cost you xxxx organic figure 08 it tends
to be have you wonder what what

392
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:04,839
circumstance it what's this goes back to
having a used if you have a

393
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:10,279
justification for you needing that
longer retention time then you can

394
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:14,140
justify having it but remember to work
with in things like compressed Lux vs

395
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,410
uncompressed likes things that you can
work within in order to save yourself

396
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:24,339
the trouble of having to justify a huge
number on E Pio and the headache of

397
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:28,279
having to explain it and also despite
the fact that we would love to have

398
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:33,220
perfect archives from the beginning of
the organization to now generally you

399
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,640
very rarely ever and i know im goin
would get

400
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,630
set up on Spike for saying we don't need
to be able to look into the past know

401
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:53,290
you do but within reason I mean there is
no way I'm dating myself out of this

402
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:58,780
hole you know what I only learned two
things really and that's why I think

403
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,940
you've just one stump the chump yeah I
think he gets a prize so yeah I'm not

404
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,030
really the point is once you've dug
yourself all the first lesson is you

405
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:18,080
know stop digging so thank you for that
one so I ended with a gun by fast yes

406
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:32,160
generally i've seen i've seen it where
we can store the data off into a

407
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:39,140
separate a former storage it would
really required I would argue working

408
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,760
with your sim better to figure out what
the best solution is they're always

409
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,630
going to argue you should be more
stories from us by

410
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,410
I mean having that understand ok if
we've got this much dirt road through

411
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:55,589
these logs in there but if you if for
any reason that you need for compliance

412
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:58,349
reason for another reason for legal
reasons you need to go back into them

413
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:04,279
generally being able to optimize that is
probably more on par with saving money

414
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:08,740
at that point if you need if there's the
actual justification behind it again

415
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:18,480
going back to having the use case behind
everything that you could do I think

416
00:38:18,480 --> 00:39:00,450
that's so

417
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:13,820
whenever I've added to that we have
multiple indexes we have to deal with

418
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:19,240
like you're saying it tends to be a
cluster bleep of having a ton of having

419
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,920
a bigger mess to deal with because of
exactly what you're saying I would

420
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,150
rather have a much more normalized
environment than having just all these

421
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,450
separate in Texas but I tend to have
