1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,109
when you see far right in the title I'm
not referring to the you s political

2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:09,150
far-right with respect to say
republicans where the Tea Party

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,349
anybody's guess what I'm actually
referring to as the hacker conference

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:24,960
right people yell not conservatives
extremists good that's the right answer

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,630
those neo Nazi groups skinheads violent
groups that you have heard a lot in the

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:38,680
news lately with respect to loan will
shooters individuals who are engaging in

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,680
acts of violence for some ideological or
political reason and Michigan is an

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,469
interesting state we talk about the far
right because we have a large number of

9
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:53,030
militia groups we have a number of
active communities that might be

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,960
associated with the kkk or various parts
of the far right and we also have a

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,920
unique climate where there are what are
referred to as far-left groups and I'll

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,820
talk a little bit about the far left and
in just a little bit later on the

13
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,020
presentation but the reason why we even
need to concern ourselves with this

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,909
question of extremist groups is one that
you could say is questionable

15
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,850
many of you have probably heard about
the concept of a digital Pearl Harbor

16
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,659
raise your hand if you've been in
InfoSec long enough to have heard that

17
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:33,890
one ok so this concept of a cyberattack
that's going to destroy everything

18
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,960
that's going to cause havoc panic and
destruction and certainly we've seen

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,439
some interesting elements of cyberspace
is an attack platform in the last few

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,119
years

21
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,700
Stuxnet being an excellent example of a
cyber weapon being used offensively to

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,560
try to cause harm but beyond that there
are good examples just regular types of

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,620
attacks

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:15,380
going on that have hit me again partner
ok well on the plus side there are a few

25
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:22,470
things that I can talk about without
needing the device which is a real shame

26
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,540
ya gonna have to put it on one once once
it gets up how many of you have heard

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,820
about the Danish cartoon attacks 2006
and set a good that's an excellent

28
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,950
example of political conflict where
Turkish hackers were facing any website

29
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,480
that published a cartoon featuring an
image of the Prophet Muhammad with a

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,370
bomb in his turban because of its
offensive nature toward Islam so that's

31
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:55,790
reasonable purpose of attack driven by
individuals with a specific that sucks

32
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,560
that is another good example if you look
for your program the anonymous issues

33
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
that have popped up over the last five
years are excellent examples

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,160
ideologically driven behavior that take
place on cyberspace and so this

35
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,950
challenge of figuring out how do we deal
with cyberspace as an attack platform is

36
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,890
a typical virtually any type of group
can use online communications for the

37
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,709
purposes of radicalization
indoctrination and recruitment certainly

38
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,480
Isis is the key example of that in the
last decade where we've seen this

39
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,050
massive surge in the use of Twitter as a
mechanism to dry in interested

40
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,680
individuals in fact how many of you are
familiar with the concept of foreign

41
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,640
fighters just a handful of foreign
fighters are individuals who traveled to

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,330
a specific country for the purposes of
joining up with a specific movement

43
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,840
there so there have been a handful of
individuals from the USS

44
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,480
traveled abroad mostly going through the
Netherlands in certain parts of northern

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,720
Europe to then go into Syria

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,480
and other communities in order to join
up and fight and part of that is

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,320
facilitated by recruitment via social
media because it's a platform where

48
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,170
anyone can engage and because of the
near real-time connectivity it affords

49
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,950
great social relationships to bill the
interesting part about all of this too

50
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:34,290
is that with this platform we have the
ability for troops to spin a specific

51
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,810
concept around their message

52
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,990
whereas twenty years ago and
ideologically driven group had to depend

53
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,480
upon traditional journalists news media
in order to get messages out maybe they

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,380
published scenes or a small paper-based
documents but by and large their message

55
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,540
was controlled through popular media
messaging and now we're at a point where

56
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,550
anyone with a cell phone camera or with
any kind of digital media can record and

57
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,820
produce and demonstrate to the world
what's happening on the ground and it

58
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,340
affords a unique opportunity for groups
to push their message unadulterated out

59
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:18,580
to larger groups has anyone heard about
the al-qaida lifestyle magazine inspire

60
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,290
this is another interesting example a
publication specifically developed by an

61
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:31,490
ideological movement to drive people to
its belief system and it has some very

62
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,750
interesting articles things like how to
turn a parking lot into a bomb so how do

63
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,850
you get one car and then multiples to
explode but that's just one example it's

64
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,510
also connected with various other
lifestyle issues generally how do you

65
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,580
live the faith properly how do you live
the car and properly so these are

66
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,300
interesting avenues the communications
issue though is just one element of the

67
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,840
internet then there's the bigger problem
and the one that we don't fully

68
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,930
understand which is the issue of
cyberattack against infrastructure the

69
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,890
threats to power grids to nuclear plants
to any type of electronic system and

70
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,039
certainly we know these cyber crime
problem well but the cyber extremism

71
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,240
problem is much different it's not
something that's being addressed very

72
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,760
well

73
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,860
just to give you a little bit of
information I'm not a computer scientist

74
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,720
I'm a social scientist I'm a
criminologist and increasingly people in

75
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,180
my field of research are looking at
terrorism but they're focusing

76
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,660
overwhelmingly on physical terrorism the
post 911 threats from different groups

77
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,530
and that is very important but the
broader issue of cyber attack is one

78
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,790
that is virtually ignored at least
within the social sciences and that's an

79
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,630
important gap that we need to fill
because we don't understand what groups

80
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,590
are doing then we're not going to
understand why they're doing it and that

81
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,310
is equally important to what they're
going to attack in fact understanding

82
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,560
ideology may help us in terms of
thinking about target and so what is

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,790
going to be targeted could be
dramatically different from what a group

84
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:15,660
is interested in and that's where
thinking about ideology becomes pivotal

85
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,400
so with groups like al-qaida and with
various parts of the jihadist community

86
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,420
there's an emphasis on attacking the
west through common vectors that will

87
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,370
cause harm 911 was an excellent example
of this using very small amounts of

88
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,950
resources to cause maximum dramatic
impact recently in the last 10 years

89
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,110
there's been recognition among various
movements that cyber is the way to go

90
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,710
because the ability to say fly a plane
into a building is finite you're only

91
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,870
going to be able to make that work once
it'll be harder and harder as security

92
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,880
measures improved to make certain types
of physical attacks happen but cyber

93
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,040
such a complex environment that you can
do a variety of different things and

94
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,450
make it happen over the long term and
many groups argue that the economic

95
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,660
impact of the cyberattack is equal to or
greater than that of a physical attack

96
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,350
because you have the potential to cause
fear in the general public about say the

97
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,560
safety of their money where services and

98
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,840
and the greater risk Chu causing
long-term harm to a specific tartar so

99
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,060
thinking critically how many of you lost
power

100
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,120
rephrase that how many of you lived in
Lansing in 2013 when there is the giant

101
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,110
ice storm that knocked out power over
Christmas for a week just couple of my

102
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,490
daughter was just born in November and
we wound up having to live in Indiana

103
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,279
for a week until power came back on and
that was a massive inconvenience and

104
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,420
that was just because a big ice storm
knocked out services something much more

105
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,680
targeted and much more specific against
an electrical grid could have a great

106
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,029
impact and if it could be associated
with were tied to an ideological

107
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:16,220
movement you can imagine the impact that
would have that's where this issue of a

108
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,710
if you are comfortable with the term and
electronic Pearl Harbor could really

109
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,710
happen but the sophistication in the
complexity of the attacker environment

110
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:32,200
is something that we don't fully
understand and thinking strategically we

111
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,120
know what the hacker community looks
like in terms of complexity

112
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,480
sophistication and skill right you've
got this pyramidal structure we're at

113
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,190
the top

114
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,200
you've got the best skilled actors who
have the ability to produce the Euro

115
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,610
days to use them to develop new tools
and those are the individuals who we

116
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,150
really have to be worried about because
they are the game changers the

117
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,570
innovators the ones who are going to
influence long-term behavior we don't

118
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,110
know how many individuals in the
extremists community of any sort of it

119
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,930
into that top echelon of hackers could
be one could be none we really don't

120
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,610
know no one's looking at the specific
question we know it a broader level

121
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:19,230
there's a larger mid base that has some
degree of skill they're gonna borrow

122
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,380
tools they're gonna build various
iterations of devices or programs based

123
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,270
on what's been developed at the top so
they have some degree of complexity and

124
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,760
sophistication in terms of their
operational ideas but how they can

125
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,730
leverage those tools varies from person
to person if you think about it in the

126
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,830
traditional cybercrime environment
you've got the people at the top who

127
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,390
develop new software that gets used for
a while among very small clique sur

128
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,770
communities then it goes down to the
middle where you see people paying for

129
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,209
cybercrime this service and mostly the
people who are paying for those ones the

130
00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:00,730
bomb the ones he may not have a robust
enough understanding of technology but

131
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,140
have the money in order to pay for
certain services and products and if we

132
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,089
think about the structure this
development of the hacker community as a

133
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,940
pyramid this has implications for what
we want to know with respect to

134
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,040
extremist communities what can they do
how can they do it and how can they do

135
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:27,290
it well and so that's where this
question of can they had becomes

136
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:33,880
important because if we want to know
where r threats are we've gotta know who

137
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:41,209
has certain threat capabilities and who
has no offensive capability whatsoever

138
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:55,170
everybody cross your fingers and see if
this would work great

139
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:03,000
it up well moving on we know that
information flows down and so those with

140
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,430
ability to communicate that ability and
those who don't find other ways to get

141
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:13,440
what they need within various
communities we've seen the emergence of

142
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,380
various forums social media platforms
and environments where groups can

143
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,149
communicate and get together to spread
information in the jihadist community

144
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:29,680
it's fascinating because there's been a
massive growth in interests in Jax and

145
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,800
attacks in fact a very very well-known
manual was produced in 2003 a manual on

146
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,470
jihad and it had very specific elements
outlining why cyberattacks import

147
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,320
because it's going to cause economic
harm to the west and it's going to do so

148
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,880
in a way that's much harder to identify
and much harder to mitigate so that's

149
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,579
one movement that's recognizing cyber as
a person and platform beyond the

150
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,500
jihadist movement when we think
domestically what are our key threats

151
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,730
what are the homegrown groups that are a
problem this is where on a political

152
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,310
continuum you have the far left and the
far right to the far left are what we

153
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,060
would simply associate with the Animal
Liberation Front the Earth Liberation

154
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,420
Front anybody heard of those groups
before figured something I'm not

155
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,120
professor at MSU MSU we have some animal
clinics where there's testing of various

156
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,850
sorts and we were firebombed by an alpha
group and I think it was 1998 so their

157
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,180
ideological movements are typically
associated with protecting animals

158
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,490
protecting different groups if we're
thinking about the outside of things

159
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,410
they tend to target construction sites
there's some interesting manuals online

160
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:55,430
about how to essentially ruin lumber and
construction work by spiking trees so

161
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,709
when a chain saws going through the tree
when it hits that spike its gonna break

162
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:03,040
the chain jacket out maybe even into the
worker and it stopped services for a

163
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,000
while so their behaviour typically focus
around

164
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,630
injury and violence choose specific
service providers or company but then

165
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,580
you have the far right and the far right
politically in the you s where we're

166
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,200
talking about the same neo Nazi group
skinhead groups etc is fracture there's

167
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,230
a lot of different belief systems
ideologies and perspective and these

168
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:34,170
groups have a variety of different ideas
in play when you hear skinhead what do

169
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,670
you immediately think

170
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,230
Edward Norton somebody say they had that
right

171
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,530
American History X is an excellent
example of this type of movement young

172
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:55,150
white men who are angry certainly any of
the mass shooters over the last year

173
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,320
associated with different groups whether
we're talking about various factions at

174
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,010
KKK or other communities that are
present in the south

175
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,060
tied to the Confederacy or some other
type of movement and that's something to

176
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,120
really worry about but the question of
what these groups now and what they can

177
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,460
do is relatively limited we generally
associate with the far-right acts of

178
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,510
physical violence this would be a
shooting a bombing targeted

179
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,200
assassinations particularly in some
movements against abortion doctors and

180
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,960
other types of service providers so
their fixation in their general

181
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,620
practices center around violence but
this begs the question why are they

182
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,170
violent only if we're now in an age
where jihadist movements and other

183
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,420
extremist communities are moving online
are using it for recruitment and

184
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,420
increasingly toward trying to understand
how to engage in cyber attacks why isn't

185
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,140
that happening on the domestic far right
and that's a question that various

186
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,170
government agencies are interested in
addressing the National Institute of

187
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,180
Justice for instance wants to understand
what the technological capabilities of

188
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,750
the far-right look like how are they
using devices what are they using

189
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,510
and what kind of offensive or defensive
technological used to they had and how

190
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,700
is that information put forward so what
I had for today is some preliminary

191
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,640
research that we've been doing we're in
10 different far-right communities in

192
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,910
the USSR online all variants of neo Nazi
KKK skinhead boldness and other

193
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:42,480
ideological flavors and what today's
analysis focuses on if presentation can

194
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,600
ever get up is the results of that
what's interesting is that it relatively

195
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,130
conforms to our perceptions if your
immediate association with the far right

196
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:02,660
is something like Edward Norton from
American History X 10 economic status do

197
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,360
you think many of these individuals are
they living in poverty where my baby

198
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:16,439
located what's the world community's
trailer parks certainly that is a

199
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:23,640
relatively valid perception among some
movements with technological access some

200
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,589
of these folks may have no access to
high-speed Internet connectivity

201
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,050
depending on where they're living
especially in rural communities that's

202
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,840
harder to accomplish but there are other
avenues that you can use to get online

203
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,110
and our research going into one farm in
particular we've analyzed hundreds of

204
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,900
threads and we found overall that most
of these individuals don't have any

205
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,720
technological sophistication whatsoever

206
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,730
the boards that were looking at are
designed specifically to talk about

207
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:00,660
technology and their basic questions
centered around unfortunately what you

208
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,490
would expect very very basic questions

209
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,440
things like how do I get my browser to
work how do I run this in an encrypted

210
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,890
fashion what is tour how do I use it and
some questions about how to protect

211
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,930
yourself on Facebook and Twitter
essentially the kinds of questions that

212
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:22,250
you would expect parents or grandparents
who don't have any real skill

213
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,190
asked I assume virtually all of you have
a dancer basic tech support questions

214
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:33,880
for family and friends raise your hand
if yes say everybody in the same thing

215
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,450
can be observed here in a group with at
least within this one particular

216
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,150
subforum about a hundred and fifty
participants many of the questions that

217
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,810
were asked for very basic and there was
a small core of individuals who are

218
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,750
answering those questions and the types
of answers that they would give were

219
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,150
broken down in very very simple and
easy-to-understand answers you've all

220
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,220
been on Hacker boards before what's the
general response when you ask a new kind

221
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,880
of question

222
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
STFU get out that kind of thing

223
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,250
short relatively angry quick responses
read it don't ask us come back when you

224
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,420
have a real question here instead those
core members are answering questions in

225
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,440
a very polite very friendly kind of way
and an approachable fashion so that way

226
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,970
people will ask followup questions and
they'll get more answers so it's very

227
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,930
different from what we would expect in a
traditional kind of technological

228
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:42,910
discussion at least among hacker
communities and the interesting aspect

229
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,850
of this environment is the fact that the
questions are coming from individuals

230
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:53,120
who appear to be older members and the
most fascinating part of this is that

231
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,970
the site allows individuals to donate
its a very very well-known site in the

232
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,610
far right generally and so there are
donors who support the site through paid

233
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,320
amounts and they vary from person to
person but you can clearly see who's a

234
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,410
paying member who's a donor to maintain
the site and it's those donors who asked

235
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,010
the most basic questions at all and
those are the people who get the most

236
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,269
respectful responses in general what do
you think that might me

237
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:37,470
money talks was the other answer paper

238
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,179
we also think that it may be an
interesting opportunity for the people

239
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,299
who are answer to appear to be younger
to get a degree of clout because if you

240
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:53,390
have somebody who's a paying member was
relatively older who's vetted and his

241
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,799
reputation as strong they may be able to
do something for you a little bit later

242
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,690
this is only one sub forum in a much
much larger environment and so this may

243
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,710
be an interesting kind of proving ground
for some people in thinking about

244
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,559
technological skill while there's not
many individuals who seem to have any

245
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,539
wherewithal to hack that all most of the
questions are very basic there were

246
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:22,470
occasional posts that suggested the
technologically skilled ones are trying

247
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,570
to inform the larger group said they
were posting Ars Technica articles

248
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,440
information from the Guardian one of
their most fascinating runs a

249
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,450
conversation involved tour it was right
around the time when GCHQ and USC law

250
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,630
enforcement were apparently able to
crack tour and we're getting inside and

251
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,520
identifying individual users so there
are people saying how do I know that I

252
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,510
can trust or I've tried to use it I
don't exactly get it right but if I want

253
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,080
to use it how do i feel myself from risk
and there were some good answers there

254
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,250
another interesting point knowledge this
in addition to basic questions given

255
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,470
that any kind of social movement has the
ability to spread from its regional base

256
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,730
to touch national or international
audiences there are a lot of posts from

257
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:16,770
people asking how if I'm in europe do I
use the site because the European

258
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,190
Convention on cybercrime their hate
speech laws are a little different from

259
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,350
what we have in the you s so certain
sites are filtered out of policy and it

260
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,610
even can trigger in some cases
investigations at the individual if

261
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,390
they're thinking in so people were
trying to explain how do I tunnel into

262
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,179
the site how do I get access in Italy
and I want to use this specific form how

263
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,370
do we make it easier for European
members to get on and to get in

264
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,960
and this was an interesting facet
because it suggests this is a tech

265
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,170
support forum that has an international
audience and among lead tech support

266
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:58,120
providers one of the most unusual things
that we do not expect to find was

267
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,280
someone in the board who claims to have
presented at five death cons who's very

268
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,280
active in the security community but
feels like he can't talk about his

269
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,870
racial ideology in public because of the
long-term harm that that would have for

270
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,540
him for his reputation and success in
the business community we have been able

271
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,420
to validate whether or not any of that
information is accurate but it points to

272
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,410
this issue of technological distribution
and skill and interest if you've got a

273
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,220
DEFCON presenter somebody's regularly
there who's active in the security

274
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,960
community that means that there are some
potential avenues for people to get

275
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,190
information about how to hack but this
audience doesn't seem to have the

276
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,840
wherewithal to do it maybe that will
build over time we don't know one of the

277
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,360
few things that we saw that was any
evidence at all

278
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,840
technological skill and I wish I could
show you the slide but just not

279
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,230
happening today but everybody's got a
laptop in front of them are found one of

280
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,550
the members of the group was explaining
that they rebuilt a Linux distro a

281
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:13,970
program called apartheid which is a
Linux variant that is designed expressly

282
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:21,830
for the white supremacist and far-right
community they built it with specific

283
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,240
imagery in mind with certainly
connectivity issues certain language

284
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,030
sets and tried to make it

285
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,640
downloadable for everybody so they were
really pushing distribution of this i

286
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,190
SAT 04 individuals in the community to
download and use their Linux variant

287
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,920
because they felt like it would help the
movement writ large so if you have some

288
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,309
time later today Google apartheid Linux
and you'll be surprised at the results

289
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:51,929
because it is something that's been
circulating for a while so the builders

290
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:54,909
of this we're trying to drop people out
and say you know

291
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:58,190
please tested please let us know what
you think we want to make this a more

292
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,739
popular tool that discussions around
2011 and and and kept going from there

293
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:07,239
so it's something that would suggest
there are a handful of individuals who

294
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:12,470
know what they're doing but it's a very
very small subset of the total and so

295
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,529
this brings us back to this question can
a hack in general and the far-right

296
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:21,470
community at least in the ones that were
observing not really there is no

297
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,450
offensive hacking capability

298
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,210
there's a lot of defensive discussion
about how to use tour and some other

299
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,950
systems there in minimal discussion
about burner phones but yes I hope these

300
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:38,580
people don't seem to have the
wherewithal to have so far right isn't

301
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,309
happening why is the jihadist community
ideologically they have different

302
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,859
agendas both have an inclination toward
violence but in the domestic far-right

303
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:56,739
we don't see this same inclination
towards causing harm generally the

304
00:25:56,739 --> 00:26:01,639
technological basis there and so we're
trying to understand what this means

305
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:06,239
over the long term in a ten-year
timeline if you've got a group that

306
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:10,409
doesn't seem to hack but they're using
social media and you have another group

307
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:15,919
that runs to hack is using social media
well as trying to build their base are

308
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,669
spread matrix about these movements
needs to be informed and clearly sharp

309
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:25,369
because we've got understand what a
jihadist attacks might look like

310
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:30,029
relatives say Fri tax and so I wanted to
push this back to you all

311
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:34,639
what do you think this means if we've
got a group that can't hack should we

312
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,220
just write them off entirely

313
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,599
where is that a bigger challenge is that
a bigger problem if we just say they

314
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:53,370
can't act let's not worry about it

315
00:26:53,370 --> 00:27:02,790
these are both very valid points exactly
so you've got groups that know that

316
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,180
there may be some utility there so why
not pay for the service rather than

317
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,160
build it up on their own and that is
something that we need to understand a

318
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,450
little bit more we saw on our site one
person talk about Stuxnet and how it

319
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,300
would be great if we could figure out a
way to use this here but that was it

320
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,870
it pretty much tanked out after that
because there was nobody who could

321
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,559
actually support the rest of the
discussion and we've been looking at a

322
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,960
number of other sites and trying to dig
in deep and this is not just a run for a

323
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,550
problem it's not just a small community
issue it seems to be systemic at least

324
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:40,720
across the movements that we're seeing
so there is a fundamental difference and

325
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,870
if technological skill isn't there but
they can pay for it

326
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:49,100
that begs the question when is that
gonna happen if you get more notoriety

327
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,420
from a shooting from a mass shooting how
much notoriety can you get from a cyber

328
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:02,269
you have any idea yet unless

329
00:28:02,269 --> 00:29:16,090
group claims responsibility for it these
are very very valid points and so

330
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:21,669
factor right the target is going to
matter in terms of what it means so a

331
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:26,529
video of a shooting or beheading has
much more immediate impact on a large

332
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:30,630
viewing audience whereas a any kind of
defacement and/or attack is gonna make

333
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,370
as much of an impact it's something that
could be done but it's going to be much

334
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,900
harder to clean the data capture isn't
even better question how many feel well

335
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,570
the wrong audience task but how many of
you had OPM potential loss anybody get

336
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:54,399
hit in the insurance back from last year
I had 26 my cards are issued last year

337
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,110
thanks having a two-year-old

338
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,909
shop at Target you go to Home Depot all
that good stuff my day is lost

339
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:06,240
what's fascinating is that we know and
there is evidence that members of

340
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,380
jihadist communities have been buying
cards in Dana shops so there's entrance

341
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,529
into movements by one side but not the
other there's no real evidence that

342
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:20,570
suggests there's any degree of technical
competency and so perhaps it's a

343
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:26,260
question of just simple ideological
difference one is about violence fear

344
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,100
intimidation of a very specific group if
we think about the far right if their

345
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,880
ideological bent is against specific
religious or ethnic groups hitting a

346
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,059
bank hitting a financial institution or
even a service provider of anything

347
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:44,929
isn't going to have the same dramatic
impact that it would attacking a

348
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:48,649
specific community and its residents
where you want to make a dramatic

349
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:49,980
difference

350
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,330
whereas for the jihadist movement where
it does seem to be entirely about

351
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:58,390
impacting the west that's where
conditions are much more appropriate for

352
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,250
snipers hack so there may be some
factors that are driving some of this

353
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:08,640
difference but it begs the question over
the long term we know that members get

354
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,990
involved at different ages there are in
the radicalization literature these

355
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,529
questions over racial turning points
racial awakening for the far-right the

356
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,539
realization that you are of a specific
racial group

357
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,549
that puts you at odds with others is
usually what draws people in and the

358
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:30,479
same seems to be true to a certain
extent with some of the jihadist and

359
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:34,950
other movements but these racial
awakenings and things like that maybe

360
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,440
aren't necessarily technologically
facilitated entrance to the group is

361
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,419
something that can be done online but
what that means in terms of long-term

362
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:49,779
impact isn't clear how many of you would
be at all concerned if there were a

363
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:56,710
white supremacist who were defacing a
major company what if they were just

364
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,679
defacing your company may be a better
question that had a problem so this is

365
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,369
interesting this points to some
potential but long-term if you're trying

366
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:13,169
to scope out difference what our initial
findings are telling us is that perhaps

367
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:18,090
over the long term we're not going to
see a growth in cyber attack from the

368
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,429
domestic far-right we will see it from
the jihadist community it seems like

369
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:26,799
it's a question when is it going to be
huge because there have been a number of

370
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,799
smaller attacks that have happened over
the last two decades so it's a difficult

371
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,279
space and it's one that demands further
research and right now we're in a bunch

372
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:42,470
of communities many of them are
different in terms of ideology but their

373
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,039
general practice and their behaviors are
similar

374
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,830
what we're trying to do now is to do
some more targeted surveys and actually

375
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:55,700
understand what is the technological
space like these groups if you are

376
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,909
living in SE West Virginia what is your
internet access like versus individual

377
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:03,840
who's living in South Carolina isn't
that potentially impacting the

378
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,590
difference is there say a challenge to
trying to get online and engage in a

379
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,769
cyber attack if all you have access to
his dodgy dialup or you have to use

380
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:20,470
certain computers or phones so these are
questions that have to be understood one

381
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:25,730
other interesting point of access and
point of differentiation

382
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:31,390
one of the groups in our sample was
attacked by a hacker collective and

383
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,550
their entire forum was taken out and the
only reason we know this is because in

384
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,370
reading through their help section
everyone was complaining that the new

385
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,760
forum structure it wasn't as good as the
old version it's too bad the site got

386
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,380
taken down whatever group attacked them
actually deleted all of their own posts

387
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,580
so there is no archive to refer to him
they weren't maintaining it very well

388
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,070
and so if they're being targeted by
hacker collectives we don't see that

389
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,620
same that have evidence at least as deep
in terms of emerging against jihadists

390
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,710
so there's marginalization in the far
right that may be driving some of these

391
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:15,570
challenges to so sorry be presentation
didn't work this is unfortunate but

392
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,670
falling off what we can do hopefully
this was a some interest you have any

393
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:27,430
questions now I'm well ahead of schedule
and that's largely just a consequence of

394
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:44,530
technological failure so sorry about
that but one thing that's

395
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:49,510
a good question the groups that were in
at least the far-right mostly just

396
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:55,590
required registration with the forum
oddly we actually gotten messages when

397
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,440
we tried to set up accounts saying we
are going to find your social media

398
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,930
profiles and you and if we can't then
you're not going to get access and then

399
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,270
we got access to all so there was an
argument that they were going to go deep

400
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:16,760
on who we were and then nothing really
happened with the jihadist communities

401
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,900
that we're looking at they are
registration controlled but we've also

402
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,590
seen some interesting technological
developments on there and that are

403
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,550
present on the far right for instance
just trying to scroll through and save

404
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:34,650
content in large scrapes there's very
very specific and Heidi daus crawling

405
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,250
seems to be present at keeps us from
actually doing any long-term bass

406
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:45,030
collection so it's got to be very very
very slow if anybody is a university

407
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,550
student at MSU we are hiring because we
need people to do data collection on the

408
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,980
social media and things though the
groups that we have been interested in

409
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,370
finding a relatively easy to get access
to the same on Twitter so are monitoring

410
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,670
of these groups is relatively easy to
accomplish at least on the far right on

411
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,160
the jihad aside however it's a little
more difficult not only has the language

412
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,630
issues but they also seem to be aware
that there is a greater prevalence of

413
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:16,580
monitoring of their activity
particularly with Isis given that there

414
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,150
is something like four million Twitter
accounts that may be associated with

415
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,160
Isis it's such a massive community to
try to understand it it's virtually

416
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,930
impossible to just start jumping into
you gotta take a long view any other

417
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,980
questions

418
00:36:33,980 --> 00:37:04,200
plug good conversation about how to run
it properly how do I make it work so

419
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,600
less about what resources should I use
on tour but instead how do I use it just

420
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,720
chew anonymized what sites I'm visiting
on the clear web we've done some scrapes

421
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,609
third tour trying to earth through onion
based sites trying to see what if

422
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:21,990
anything we can find we did the same
thing with free not do any be used for a

423
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,840
net anymore

424
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,600
probably not configured but we've tried
to look at both places we've seen much

425
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,819
less related to the far right one or two
groups at most

426
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,290
on tour and there are some older
documents that are on train at the don't

427
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:42,580
seem to be active so there seems to be a
very very small presence of any content

428
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:51,050
hosted on tour that's germane to these
groups and the questions doesn't

429
00:37:51,050 --> 00:38:09,509
seem like it now and will they be able
to maybe so

430
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:16,419
actually thinking about the bigger kind
of socialization issues that they

431
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:21,309
mention yeah we are interested in trying
to understand this process of movement

432
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:25,179
from start to finish how do you get
involved in one of these communities and

433
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:29,889
then what leads to an eventual outcome
we have a sample of incidence of

434
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:34,809
violence so people who have committed in
the far-right movements and act of

435
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:41,109
violence whether lethal or just even an
assault and a sample of failed plots and

436
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,229
successful plots for the jihadis
communities so we're trying to

437
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:48,359
reconstruct ninety days pre and post
what their social media presence looks

438
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,719
like to see if we can identify any peeps
trots differences and communication

439
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,709
emotional expression stuff like that and
seeing if we can develop some kind of a

440
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:01,869
typology to understand here is right and
act of violence is going to look like

441
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:06,829
immediately beforehand and immediately
afterward what the network does whether

442
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:10,329
it dissolves whether it actually
strengthens after an incident and what

443
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:15,689
that means of a long-term we also want
to her trying to find ways to understand

444
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:20,899
how certain movements may sink up
eventually like say anonymous with other

445
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:26,789
movements the reason I say this in 2012
there was a defacement by an animal

446
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:31,549
liberation front group that also was
tied to anonymous or at least they use

447
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:36,579
the same language as anonymous and
engaged in a defacement so there's some

448
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:40,449
potential connection there but we don't
know if that's a real thing or just

449
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:44,630
simply perhaps the cover on the part of
whomever it was on the Animal Liberation

450
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,559
Front side just trying to draw some
attention to their activity but that is

451
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,800
something we don't understand further
yes ma'am

452
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,810
insiders so what's the difference
between say the far right and the

453
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,580
jihadist movement terms of sheer number

454
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,100
great question it seems like the
jihadist movement may be somewhat

455
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,680
smaller at least internationally based
on total numbers of individuals who may

456
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,340
be involved in the location for thinking
about broader social media and networks

457
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:21,620
writ large they can be much much larger
in terms of domestic far-right we know

458
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,320
that they seem to have peaks and troughs
in terms of membership if you look at

459
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,080
the online communities they're a little
smaller than what we see on the jihadist

460
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,820
and one group for instance one form has
about 200 members total so it's much

461
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,260
much smaller than what you might think
of what other types of movements whereas

462
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,510
with the eg hadas forums that we've got
they have thousands of members whether

463
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,050
that actually means thousands of
individual identities we don't know but

464
00:40:46,050 --> 00:41:30,460
there is some substantial size
difference yes sir that's a good

465
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,200
question in terms of sheer economic
financing at least on the far right a

466
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,270
lot of their funds seem to come from
various local events for a long time

467
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,430
a lot of money was generated through
music and live music events concerts and

468
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,060
things like that there was a
particularly large record label that was

469
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,770
selling a lot of merchandise CDs and
other material that was in turn being

470
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:00,430
funneled back and some organizations so
at least on those very overt social

471
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,510
movements like say the National
Socialist Movement

472
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,810
Stormfront those kinds of groups
generate funds but there is a much

473
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:12,740
smaller level while there are some quasi
far-right groups that exists that are on

474
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,230
the periphery that are more like
political action groups that can

475
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,080
generate more dollars but in terms of
what that actually means for long-term

476
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,690
financing we we can't fully tease out it
would seem as though at least two to get

477
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,820
the kind of the court your question that
the far-right doesn't have the same

478
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,550
economic weight behind it that some of
the other movements to like the

479
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,900
jihadists where there's a greater skill
and ability in terms of moving money

480
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:48,000
laundering money and developing it from
different sources it's particularly hard

481
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,630
to know now especially with some of the
mass shooting that happened over the

482
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:57,380
last year and what that might mean for
general perception of very race-based

483
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,010
movements if they're going to be able to
continue to gain traction where this is

484
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,750
actually going to stymie their
development so I can't say for sure but

485
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:09,110
my immediate assumption would be that
they're probably going to stay on the

486
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,960
same trajectory in terms of development
and growth they don't seem to be

487
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,640
massively increasing when Barack Obama
was installed as president there was

488
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,110
some peak but that seems to have stayed
about the same their arguments by some

489
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,380
groups like the Southern Poverty Law
Center that there is an increase in

490
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,570
numbers but we can't say with real
concrete certainty that there's been a X

491
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:55,140
number of individuals change in what the
movement looks like yes

492
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,500
the groups say how many members appear
across specific forums or how much

493
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,240
sharing there is that we can observe so
one team borrows tools from another but

494
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,000
we have seen some evidence of
individuals in these movements generally

495
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,940
biting off tools from foreign countries
and replacing the language pack with an

496
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,440
Arabic language character set and then
saying that they are their own tool

497
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,920
we've got a handful of them that are
detox related and encryption related

498
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,500
just for safe packing malware so they're
not overly sophisticated it seems to be

499
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,330
someone else's building if you go back
to the original source post when it

500
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:34,410
first came online but they they seem to
at least understand you don't have to

501
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,720
reinvent the wheel there's enough hacker
tools out there where you can kind of

502
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:55,880
cobble together something of your own

503
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,650
with enough enough access at the moment
we're collecting data from multiple so

504
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,559
we're in the process of analyzing one so
we can't say for sure yet it seems like

505
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:09,180
there's a small number of people who
have real real skill but there's a lot

506
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,150
of people posting tutorials and things
like that so it's a little different at

507
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,880
least in terms of technological
expertise it seems like they're a little

508
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,369
a little better at least more cognizant
let's focus on acting here some hacking

509
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:25,039
tools here some tricks here some
tutorials which we don't see it on fire

510
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:31,410
right any other questions thanks for
bearing with me sorry for the

511
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:37,470
technological failure on my part but
quick know if you're interested in these

512
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:43,920
types of studies if you're finding this
to be a kind of unique idea we run a

513
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,240
cybercrime conference at MSU our
conference will be March 17th if you're

514
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,779
a CISSP have any certifications it'll be
actually available as a as a four credit

515
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:59,410
experience will have the CISO the
University you may have heard of a guy

516
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,700
by the name of Gary runner at University
of Alabama will be one of our speakers

517
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:10,170
have some transit experts chrome
producer and our keynote for those of

518
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:14,859
you who may be interested in something
like this will be a DOJ computer hacking

519
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:17,490
intellectual property prosecutor who
will talk about some of the issues

520
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,589
related to cyber crime and there'll be
lots of social science presentations

521
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:25,990
like this related specifically to
malicious software any pot use and

522
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:31,680
identifying attackers and other aspects
related to cyber crime so thanks

523
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:31,900
everybody
