1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,990
were rules for talks that I give signee
crowd participation I don't care if you

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,190
throw stuff had me not the hamburger so
please leave that on your plate does it

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:16,870
look like you're gonna throw it at me
anyway nice Diet Pepsi not gonna help

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,530
the name of our talk is spanking the
monkey help investors can do it better

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,510
not safe for work addition because I'll
probably use the F word three or four

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,240
times because I'm actually gonna be
doing a live demo were up here we all

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,780
know how well the demo gods treat us
when we try to do this but we're gonna

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:39,630
go we also wanted to say thank you to
brackets because I don't know brackets

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,520
so my name is Justin Whitehead I work as
a team member you can see our company

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,500
logo plastered on everything I have to
support them because they're the ones

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,410
who pay for me to come to these things
this week so we're for a company called

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,870
and told security Denver Colorado I
really started forensics so I have a

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,760
different way of looking up in testing
the most people I like to actually find

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,970
our not a perv well I like to find out
once something has been broken how it

15
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,120
was broken so it's kind of gonna be a
little bit of why this talking about

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,380
tester Bishop I'm also out of Denver
Colorado my job title keeps changing as

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,600
well I'm self-employed and I can make it
whatever I want so right now I'm going

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,050
with the guy who face Italy till he
makes it harder handles up here I don't

19
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,270
feel I have enough to her followers I
don't understand exactly how to use

20
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:47,090
Twitter apparently neither does chris
Roberts just say that alright who stalks

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,270
intended for use my super Cox rock star
cluster out here

22
00:01:53,270 --> 00:02:01,590
nobody raised their hand I don't get the
Tony want to leave this this was set up

23
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,159
for junior pins testers I want to get
information to the guys who are just

24
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,110
getting into the field I see a lot of
young faces out here I would you guys

25
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,319
like have a good time at conferences the
first couple conferences I went to shit

26
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,549
was so far over my head that I just
gonna suck their glazed-over so this is

27
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,340
we're trying to bring a little bit lower
incisors didn't know there was another

28
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,980
way to dupe interesting we run into the
salat

29
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,530
customers who have forgotten the old
ways or super rock star Pentastar out

30
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,890
there who would raise his hand and only
realized I know suburban anymore this is

31
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,930
just a little refresher for you and
those are curious about what the tools

32
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,530
do what we did is we actually

33
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,990
made a web page for this and made it to
our tools can find things tools that are

34
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,540
awesome so that's kind of what we're
working with

35
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,579
the stock actually came around from last
year's Derby Conn Oct 3rd on trance talk

36
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,900
if you've never seen this man speak he's
awesome

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,920
go watch one of his talks look it up on
security to your not be sad about it but

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,629
one thing he said release doctor stuck
in my mind and the other author

39
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:17,220
co-author of this presentation if you
can be replaced by a tool you will be we

40
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,540
are not cheap employees and let's be
honest good security is hard to find and

41
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,069
were not cheap so anyway a company can
cut a corner by buying the new blinky

42
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,079
light tool they're gonna do that they're
not going to think twice about getting

43
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,930
rid of you we need to show the value
that we have that we actually have

44
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,659
the company's stock photo back here in
the back with cigars chris Roberts we

45
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:51,180
were together right there's Chester when
he had hair no beard there's me in the

46
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:00,840
front side and less five years why
you're here why you guys are sitting

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,790
here early so we hope your city or poor
we're going to shoot some new ways to

48
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,989
become more stole the attacker IDS is
will pick up any scare you throw at him

49
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,040
I don't care how about to throw it back
you can't throw it over back enough for

50
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,570
the speed that I type at you also notice
I do a lot of cut and paste in the same

51
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,139
because we don't have three hours for me
to type everything out we went to

52
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,470
demystify the idea that scanners are
quickness sorry there are necessary evil

53
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,280
they are not at all to everything

54
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,180
we also want to make you more valuable
asset something I can be replaced by a

55
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,190
tool

56
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,230
why we

57
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,490
were here where we here we totally
understand there's a time and place for

58
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,950
tool any tool that we talk about what
we're up here today we use we're not

59
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,840
going to say we don't use us as we're
not going to say we don't use birth

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,560
we're not going to say we don't use
sequel map every time we go out on

61
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,450
engagement very rarely do you have the
engagement says take your time let me

62
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,820
see what you can find no they enjoy a
class A and two days to scan it

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:10,020
everybody has had to deal with that out
there yet show of hands already why

64
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,080
manual testing why does it work

65
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,090
what does it do

66
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,790
we're going to focus on web application
testing which is pretty much the eighth

67
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,250
grade of held me I wanted a much better
at it but it's something we all have to

68
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,950
do it's a necessary evil of our job

69
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,660
during by a set of rules forcing the UN
is a pen tester rules are meant to be

70
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,580
broken

71
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,160
break every rule you can to break into a
company because you know what that's

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,560
what the bad guy does is a bad guy come
in say oh I can only be limited to this

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,500
scope

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,640
Jason gave a great talk yesterday was
talking about their that's what I'm

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,170
talking about things are ready for high
and Jason gave a great talk or is

76
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,580
expanding the scope and had his arms out
wide and by the time they have the whole

77
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,560
scope done his hands were closed

78
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,090
how many people don't entrust like that
I read 23 outstanding junior goes deep

79
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,770
in testing tools are in addition to
testing we don't want you to have them

80
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,160
is the be all end all the tools we also
don't want you to end up as a commander

81
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,770
monkey junkie we're not gonna say who
this person is

82
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,890
I'm a minute order coming about him
already but the poor guy is out of a job

83
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,760
right now so I don't want to stealing
hubcaps to get scan results

84
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,400
right solutions manual custom web
applications for the following burner

85
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
abilities we do cross site scripting
we're going to sequence action we're

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
gonna do command injection

87
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,849
we pick

88
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:57,050
top ten I keep getting older and they
stay the same each overhead on every

89
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,439
single place we go through we find these
how many years just as actually looking

90
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,319
up only one of them was swapped its
still on the list one went from two to

91
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,590
three

92
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:17,150
in the last ten years and years these
exploits of work every new operating

93
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,820
system that comes out these exploited
still work every web developer design

94
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,370
something is coding this stuff and for
us it's a beautiful thing

95
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,000
use it to your advantage

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,970
we did find a really cool quote use
tools wisely security vulnerabilities

97
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,310
can be quite complex and buried in
monuments and bounds of code in any case

98
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,010
most cost-effective approach to finding
a limiting these weaknesses as human

99
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,400
experts armed with knowledge that's what
we want in part on you guys today we

100
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,910
want to give you some knowledge to do
this

101
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,900
so we're gonna start with cross site
scripting cross-site scripting is

102
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,590
currently the number three saying on the
top 10 let you read here about what

103
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,870
crossroads cross-site scripting is a
quick review what we want you guys to

104
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,600
take away the most is that when you're
testing for cross-site scripting the

105
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:23,000
context is the key part

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,550
same thing for single injection
injection is currently the number one

107
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:36,130
thing on the top 10 and the key takeaway
is that your testing for input that is

108
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:43,270
not correctly sanitized and then last
but not least is command command

109
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:51,760
injection also a part of the top one on
you guys laughing over here at the top

110
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,920
item on the Oscar top 10 and it's a part
of the injection everybody loves the

111
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,410
show we want to get a special thank you
to Egypt and display for providing our I

112
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:12,380
love shells caption alright so first off

113
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,310
reuse Nexus we're gonna read some more
flying things at me with that being said

114
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,560
everything that we did we took a
directly out of the box every every

115
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,260
place we seem to go to the says we have
Nexus running were like ok cool what

116
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,760
scripts you have running what have you
done to specialize

117
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,420
so we did what most of our clients do we
took a straight out the box fired it up

118
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,910
and that's how we're gonna run it we did
not do any special settings we did

119
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,790
nothing so he ran against our beautiful
web page you will see in a few moments

120
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,340
it took eleven thousand requests in our
webpage we know we have command

121
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,160
injection we have sequel injection and
we have cross-site scripting meses out

122
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,620
of the box was not able to find a single
one of those we didn't hide them well

123
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,980
yeah we give them a little bit couldn't
find anything it's an 11,000 request was

124
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,550
eleven thousand requests to your ideas

125
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:16,880
alright how many guys just turn those
alerts when they start your you guys

126
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:26,970
there don't lie to us at all Brad love
you all right next year and sequel

127
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,680
sequel map we did everything we said the
level 25 to risk the three the highest

128
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,220
you can see my bet she will map is an
amazing tool if you use it you

129
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,290
understand why it's such an amazing tool
is something I use all the time I'm

130
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,120
learning more and more about it every
day

131
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,010
the greatest thing about it is it's open
source these guys do this for the love

132
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,820
of coding why anybody loves coding this
much is beyond me but thank you for them

133
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,350
they are the amazing people this
industry

134
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,470
with a single map around 20,000 requests
for me again lit up an IDS like you

135
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,160
wouldn't believe so everybody

136
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:13,870
also was unable to find anything in
there next to his birth we suburb up

137
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,670
straight out of the box again didn't
change a single thing

138
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:25,380
excellent Chester alright bird shaped
our backs will actually out of the box

139
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,600
did manage to find command injection but
why didn't find the sequins are the

140
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,720
secret injection and cross-site
scripting we get into that a little bit

141
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,600
rather talk a little bit more about how
to actually

142
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,910
or why you should actually get into
treating the tools quite a bit without

143
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,500
doing in the toys you're not going to
find anything

144
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,120
the tools are great but there's other
things do you need actually know how

145
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,139
that all works right settings are
important

146
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,790
learn the settings of these tools take
some time read through the necessary are

147
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,970
reaping the necessary page there's a lot
of information on it was a lot of great

148
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,440
information on it said it set up missus
to be really powerful same with her

149
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,810
tools make too many requests alright
you're gonna set off the ideas in a

150
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,620
heartbeat

151
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,380
there's no way you can see by using one
of these stores I don't care how much

152
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,100
you throw it back they just come too
quickly from here on out since birth

153
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,200
actually found something we're going to
use birth as a reference tool

154
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:37,530
so we're moving on brigade commander
here I'm gonna keep my pants on I really

155
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,460
look for tear away pants yesterday so I
could wear something underneath them

156
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,660
hopefully we're going to do everything
with manual with manual testing from

157
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,310
here on out

158
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,700
so

159
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,310
do you hear me

160
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,450
so once again we're gonna start with
cross site scripting we're going to

161
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,770
focus on the reflected cross-site
scripting like we saw earlier the tools

162
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,779
are gonna send lots of requests and
other probes we only need one but we

163
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:11,350
don't even need that if we take a look
at the website and understand the

164
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:18,550
context and how it's setup so if we
switch over here to our website we can

165
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,800
see that we have a very angry monkey
here but our website is running PHP 5

166
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:34,670
it's using the latest html5 css3 or one
of those who actually write web pages

167
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,839
please don't hate us because we made it
really basic but if we take a look

168
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,300
around and we're looking for cross-site
scripting

169
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:49,750
so we'll take a look at the about us
page and appear at the top will see that

170
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:55,830
it's loading a document that could be
something interesting for us later on

171
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:03,260
but we'll go back to our home page and
our Members page so if we take a look at

172
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,160
our Members page and click on the
profile of one of our members

173
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,259
up here we can see that there's a 42 in
the URL and there's also a forty-two

174
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:19,980
down here in the text so when we're
dealing with cross site scripting what

175
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,730
we're looking for is places where the
input can affect the outlet

176
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,980
so we see the 42 and we can try and see
what happens if we add something to it

177
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,740
to see if its effects so we had it I
don't see anything in there too much

178
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:44,430
let's take a look at the source page and
scroll down here to the section then we

179
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,160
can see that are dipped eg Bowtech
didn't get in there

180
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,339
so we'll move on there and we'll go back
to the login page to login page

181
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:00,050
everybody should know where be hopefully
familiar with the idea that login pages

182
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,680
are a great person process

183
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,630
so what we're going to do first is we're
going to just see what happens when we

184
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,220
log in

185
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,440
no username know nothing we get an error
message back nobody here with the user

186
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,940
name so we look a little bit closer at
it we can see that maybe there might be

187
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,950
some spot for something after the user
name

188
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:27,130
so if we try logging in again with just
a simple user name

189
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,030
hopefully doesn't exist we get back a
little bit different error message

190
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:37,970
nobody here with the user name and
username so we seek we can see how our

191
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,090
input affected the output of the web
page and then if we take a peek at the

192
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,329
source information

193
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:51,619
and we come down here and see that that
wine is between a couple of dead pigs so

194
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:56,889
we saw that our employees affected the
output and I we see that the output that

195
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:02,480
it produced is between a couple of pics
so if we weren't a to edit something on

196
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,959
the web page we would have to start by
putting it in between some tags of some

197
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,860
sort or HTML

198
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:21,890
so we had a chance of text and context
and then send it to it see what happens

199
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:28,660
we see that our new text showed up in
its format just like we talked in so

200
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,220
this is actually proof enough that cross
site scripting exist on the website not

201
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,430
too useful though however so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna try running some

202
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:53,010
client-side JavaScript to see what
happens

203
00:16:53,010 --> 00:17:03,360
and now we have some cross site
scripting with running client-side text

204
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:12,140
that won't show up in any log so let's
take a peek why this was working for why

205
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:20,829
this wasn't working so necessary start
Nexus and SQL now didn't find it but

206
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:27,130
that's okay that's not initially what
they were written to do but didn't catch

207
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,820
it but why didn't catch it but didn't
catch it because the tools used markers

208
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:40,690
so on this side we can see that in the
highlighted area is our school is the

209
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,280
alert script and then on either side of
it are a couple of markers so what Burke

210
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,960
will do is it will send that string into
its website and then when it comes back

211
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,720
it will look for those markers on the
outlet and if it ceases markers and says

212
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,280
hey the sites were able to cross site
scripting or whatever it was testing so

213
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,950
what we did is we wrote a little PHP
blog here that says take the input if

214
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:16,070
you see the carrot there then return it
with 1337 which is why we were getting

215
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,050
the username 1327 we were trying to
login no matter what we really put in

216
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,460
her

217
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:31,130
and alright so we're gonna move on a
single injection we're gonna find it

218
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,370
we're going to exploit it

219
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:38,450
abuses his big long thing as it's
running

220
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,150
worrisome somewhere we're just gonna
make a smaller ladies size doesn't

221
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,660
matter all the time this is one time
smaller is better he said we're gonna

222
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,260
move into a demo again hope it all works

223
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,750
so

224
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:02,390
to do is figure out where the microphone
is so first thing to do is moving to

225
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,960
hear

226
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,150
quick look so I want to find out a
little bit more what's going on the site

227
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,070
like i said im gonna do a lot of cutting
pasting because I don't think anybody

228
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,659
has spacious luxury type

229
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:19,230
so

230
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:31,080
let's take a quick look with girl baby

231
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,750
so we get back two hundred we know
whether it's running Apache Apache

232
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,130
client

233
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,610
PHP everything that Russia was talking
about before so now we know for sure

234
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,130
that what's running

235
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,389
ok so now let's take a look around the

236
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,360
page really pursue

237
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,220
basis looks like it could give us some
information to say look over here we

238
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,520
have something text document may be
being called so we're throw that in

239
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,770
there real quick see what happens he
gets back

240
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,330
might be something we want to come back
to her blind sequel injection but right

241
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,270
now it's not it's not it's not are
looking for

242
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:21,290
so we'll go down here to the members

243
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:29,990
parts of the login page give it a quick
dry there

244
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,850
now looking that great so we go to the
Members page click to the members here

245
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:41,670
all right we got something there that is
OK theres a forty-two there are back to

246
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,260
members

247
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,050
alright I noticed something changing now
I know I've got a good feeling that this

248
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,390
is being called a database ago just
double check with Seattle chester has to

249
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,640
say yeah it's calling from a database so
let's figure out where to pick on

250
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:14,010
Antonio's since he's not here miss me
this is why I don't type right there's

251
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,300
no user with that I didn't get me back
what I stephen was born to so its trade

252
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,140
in this order

253
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,320
alright I've got my secret garden

254
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,080
we're currently can walk around anymore
that's gonna give me right there I know

255
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,870
it does seem to injection I'm gonna
start searching through here so it's

256
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,160
your where I can put it in certain some
information

257
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:46,200
yeah so actually just just point out to
me we need to figure out which marker it

258
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,130
was so

259
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:57,050
most people are gonna figure it's going
to be the take no that didn't do it

260
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,660
right so I may try this

261
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,660
ash alright give me my hair that's
that's what's causing this week where to

262
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,050
happen

263
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:15,480
where all can I put it it's come back
over here

264
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,410
alright I can I got the sequel we're
here as well so sick a quick look at

265
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:32,570
what's happening behind the scenes

266
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,640
figure out what's going on

267
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:49,770
alright so using the girl I see that I
got my same syntax error down here I

268
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,070
figured out exactly where it broke that
which was right behind there we realize

269
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:59,600
this isn't super realistic but one of
the things that we truly have found is

270
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,660
will we do do this

271
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,990
we don't we may not get this great of
information like that for me gesture

272
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,790
we may not get all this great
information but we usually do get

273
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,380
something back and that usually our
foothold that's where we start it and

274
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,380
start working out from there it's great
it shows us the entire syntax for what

275
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,450
just happened again not super realistic

276
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,050
the other thing I was looking at is
right down here i'm looking at that I

277
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,780
get the exact same thing from the page

278
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:41,670
the next morning so we know that the
site is going to be a sequel injection

279
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,440
so in order to get single injection to
work properly

280
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,380
we have to fix our queries so that they
also return properly so what we're gonna

281
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,900
do it for that is if we go up here to
our website and then we're going to add

282
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:05,660
and always true statement in this case
you know what is

283
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:14,950
is one so we had that in but we still
get the error message so interesting

284
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,530
things about this error message when you
look at it first thing we noticed is it

285
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:25,270
actually removed all of our spaces so
whatcha gonna do next is actually add in

286
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:38,850
brackets by doing percent 09 which is
the coding for brackets tap tap sorry

287
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,090
total

288
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:55,660
busted up four times we practice this
morning

289
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,930
all right and it returns are true
statement because it's back exactly what

290
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,580
we're looking for

291
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,620
so never gonna take a little bit closer
look what happened with the sequel

292
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:18,789
injection statement and white broken so
as you can see up here we have our our

293
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:22,269
simple statement that we found in the
comments of the HTML code

294
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:28,769
and so the first important thing to say
is that we have a couple of sealed from

295
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:29,870
our database

296
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,090
we got the user's you get the idea and
we got the username and then when you

297
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,770
see a look at the beck / there is justin
pointed out earlier what it does is it

298
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,690
turned that pic quote into a comment or
about an escape character and all of

299
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,460
that text highlighted in red or
underscoring red becomes the idea field

300
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,570
and it's what to expect as another
column name or something like that and

301
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,980
it says it sees Antonio it doesn't
recognize Antonio so it returns an error

302
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,980
message when we went down here and
corrected it we added our or one

303
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,960
statement and says or one

304
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,159
well that's true so we'll just returned
everything that we can sort of the great

305
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,600
things about this is actually gave us
about it a lot of recon we now know that

306
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,090
there's multiple fields so we're
actually working exploiting how many

307
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:33,870
shells are technically are in this so
just going to add in again cut and paste

308
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:42,759
we're not gonna try to missus up

309
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:52,480
alright so we got

310
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,510
we got some time back from this what we
did is actually ran to see one two and

311
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,660
three Collins

312
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,750
it automatically notice that there were
more that there is something different i

313
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,679
three columns so it returns on there for
us in His Word basically exporting the

314
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,440
error messages which is one of the
greatest ways to exploit something let

315
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,070
it tell you what to do next we're going
to a dinner for

316
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:22,250
and it returns true now if we had enough
I've its gonna go ahead and tell us it's

317
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,659
not right because it will actually tell
you exactly where you need to be this is

318
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,320
all exploiting years again five number
of columns difference we go back to the

319
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,500
fore

320
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:43,270
it's all there for us

321
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,790
so it is kind of an overview of this
next step what we're doing on so we know

322
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,690
the website is wonderful to see cool
injection so what we're trying to do is

323
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,820
look through the database and see if we
find something that well more

324
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:01,360
interesting than the username and I did
and then you know where it goes from

325
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,340
there so as we just demonstrated first
what we want to do is find out the

326
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,020
number of columns then what we want to
do is find out the names of those

327
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,240
columns see if any of those column names
sound interesting and and see if we can

328
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:32,370
get some data out of it so just as
copying pasting skills are better than

329
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:44,180
mine but luckily he caught it for me so
what we want to do first is still the

330
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:53,590
command correctly but what we're doing
here is we're running a union or a joint

331
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:59,490
command trying to compare the values of
one database for one table to another or

332
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,630
even in this case the same table but
what we do but what happens is we don't

333
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,760
know all the tables are all the call
names so we get an error message back

334
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,750
saying that Twitter is missing so if we
add Twitter back to our list here

335
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,220
column names then we can see

336
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:32,669
a next time it returned an error message
saying the password colin is missing so

337
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:37,049
so there's the password call or at least
you know the column name that was

338
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:42,760
missing so password call that sounds
like it could have something fun and it

339
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,530
so now we want to see what what the
actual value of that house where Collins

340
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:57,789
so for that we're going to use this
little polygon thing and what it's

341
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:05,480
trying to do is perform some type of
mathematical equation on the data that

342
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,539
it reads however it's gonna come into an
error is not going to be able to read

343
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:17,490
the data from the password field because
it's not really memorable but the cool

344
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,539
thing about what it does is when it sees
here is not going to just say hey this

345
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:30,059
didn't work its gonna tell you exactly
why it didn't work and in this case why

346
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:39,500
it did not work is because let me tell
this let me think of a secure password

347
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,380
you'll never guess one is not a
numerical value but guess what that is

348
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,490
the special

349
00:30:51,490 --> 00:31:03,590
so we got the password for the other
ones we got the password what's the next

350
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:11,950
thing we want to do with the password
anyone anyone

351
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:18,260
same page so go back to our wonderful
web page and again miss me how they're

352
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:25,409
getting closer to a loner a key can you
find a lot like the nevermind I'm gonna

353
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:31,679
say that right

354
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,870
remember I dispose name we actually did
this wrong the other day

355
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,490
all right we're going to pretend there's
a checkbox and the passwords on plane

356
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:45,450
takes our web editor going to work with
him so yes we've managed to log in

357
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,399
defied the demagogues now four times
with this time let's all get a round of

358
00:31:50,399 --> 00:32:00,740
applause for this you don't define a
demo god's often alright so you're

359
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:09,100
couple looks like a couple of things
here

360
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,370
so this is how we're able to to trick
the tools into not showing your showing

361
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,970
that the website was not vulnerable so
we really did is we replaced the

362
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:24,340
backslash and we replace spaces with
nothing or some more characters and that

363
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,690
was enough to trick the tools into
believing that these website that this

364
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,049
website anyways was not vulnerable to
all the stuff that we just group was

365
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:38,710
honorable as an interesting side note if
anybody here is a web developer don't do

366
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,820
stuff like this to your webpage it works
to take the tools but your website is

367
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:52,340
still vulnerable couple things but found
it when we actually went through it said

368
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,760
thorough and the check the rest style
URL parameters single mom was still

369
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,659
getting your views and we're actually
still working on trying to figure that

370
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:05,429
out our souls of where it was confusing
it so much

371
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:08,539
maps open source get involved

372
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:12,919
get involved with the community maybe
figure help us figure this out to be a

373
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:16,510
great side project if you have you know
that much spare time between work and

374
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,929
going on

375
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:29,779
finally we're going to cover some
command line injection let's go get a

376
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:38,110
shelf so we've been through almost all
the pages on our website and the only

377
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,480
page we have really messed with so far
is the learn about us so as we showed

378
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,080
earlier this is loading a document from
the file system or from someplace we

379
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,190
tested it out with the SQL injection so
we can be fairly certain that it's not

380
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,820
loading the style from a database so
when it comes to command line injection

381
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,840
there's a couple of different ways to do
it we got some some key markers here for

382
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,849
the first one is going to be the
semicolon and then we can try a command

383
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:17,119
and see if it works out and it didn't
work out so the next little marker is a

384
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,020
command or a pipe give that a shot and
see what happens again it didn't work

385
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:40,500
out and in the last one is 2% side and
I'm going to not remember this or so

386
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:52,190
so if we do the percent sign and in the
26 here which all this is doing is HTML

387
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:58,800
encoding the ampersand character so we
were telling telling the server behind

388
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:07,510
this to go ahead and load the script up
and then also run echo and that didn't

389
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:15,300
work there there is extra one there now
I know what I'm looking for

390
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,860
so we can see that our website is unable
to command line injection which burb

391
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:29,510
also told us so echoing a command or
echoing some numbers or we can even just

392
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:36,580
look at the file system where and see
all of our web files that that's that's

393
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:44,510
fun but it's not quite as fun so let's
see if we can't see something more

394
00:35:44,510 --> 00:36:01,010
interesting like the source file and
well so that didn't work what we can do

395
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:07,210
though is tried maybe it doesn't take
full pass so we can try to work our way

396
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:17,819
around it to get it so

397
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:22,719
is basically you know CDN up to the root
and then back down to the atty password

398
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:28,999
file but that didn't work either but as
where you know lighting in here all of

399
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:35,199
our normal Linux commands are working
and you know so if there were something

400
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,219
fun and interesting installed on the
server we could potentially use it and

401
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:46,349
what we're gonna try is net cash because
whatever doesn't have not had installed

402
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:47,540
on it

403
00:36:47,540 --> 00:37:12,520
so we're internet cat and it's working I
promise and

404
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:21,690
wherein so we have you know some who had
access to the server mainline injection

405
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:48,350
has worked justly mister this right this
time and we got a shell so one of the

406
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,870
really cool things where we are as
enjoyed the most trust me you don't know

407
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:57,319
how much I'm sweating up your right now
there's also this order

408
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,809
one really cool things as the places
I've worked at when you tell me to

409
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:05,089
interview with us you know just
interview with the sea so because let's

410
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:10,259
face it must see so as we know have a
CISSP and that's about all they know you

411
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:14,109
actually interview with us at the lower
level I will ask you questions like this

412
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:18,469
you know how how can you set up Nexus to
run better how can you set up to run

413
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:24,650
better if you say you just oh yeah
pretty much done with you right there if

414
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,799
you come in and you can tell me how to
set up necessarily weaken turnaround say

415
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:33,039
but I would do it this way who do you
think's gonna get that job do you make

416
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,069
yourself that much more valuable do you
make yourself stand out

417
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:43,999
yes you're going to be the guy look at
this one we hope you guys feel like

418
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:48,219
someone and Howard monkeys right now
that you're already backing plugin

419
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:51,849
necessary running that again I don't
know where this picture came from but it

420
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:56,549
is truly awesome because I'm pretty sure
that's a cliff is about to get thrown

421
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:58,160
off of

422
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,940
really want to say a really big special
thanks to Santonio he was a guy who

423
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,960
helped me originally right this is
taking the mission worldwide is taking

424
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,400
it to the lowest common denominator he
somewhere in South East Asia South

425
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,380
America we don't even know where he is
right now but one thing we really wanted

426
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,480
to do is have you all squeezed in here
and get a group picture if you're

427
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,289
comfortable with that with everybody
waving and Antonia so everybody's reason

428
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:42,679
don't do it once did you guys are golden
which one you guys talkers represents

429
00:39:42,679 --> 00:40:29,990
making fun of them I got two emails
already

430
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:42,730
anyway special things Santonio the guy
is great if you ever get a chance to

431
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,330
meet him

432
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,310
recalling the Spaniard or internally oh
yes I think a Spanish accent if you

433
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,970
would have seen the stock when I gave it
with him we almost needed an interpreter

434
00:40:51,970 --> 00:41:01,680
next is if you're worried about learning
this don't be if we made it look either

435
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,980
super easier super awesomer oh my god
I'm never gonna figure this out don't

436
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,530
worry about it like Justin said him and
Antonio Road to talk gave it a couple of

437
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:15,450
times until you decide to go travel the
world for some reason so I stepped in

438
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:20,150
and I was able to pick this up after
about six hours of studying it so if

439
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,330
it's something you're worried about
learning it looks super difficult don't

440
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,560
worry about it it's not just take your
time

441
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,790
read through it and to help you out
we've actually made some improvements so

442
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:37,420
Chester being the guy who likes you pay
for stuff has opened up again hope you

443
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,880
have a good cameras outside pressure
that that's pretty awesome right now

444
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,440
we're taking the time to put everything
up there we have everything we have the

445
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,000
website we have all the pages that we
found the information on we we seriously

446
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,349
want to get the information that you
guys you guys we want you guys to have

447
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,799
as much fun with this is we've had the
other thing we ask us in the comments

448
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:02,410
section there something more you want to
learn about I actually really enjoy

449
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:08,079
doing this somebody she talks so I had
to sit there and some new PC gear or

450
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,509
something like that

451
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:12,950
let us know we're more interested to sit
down and actually try to come up with

452
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,400
the talk to help people out

453
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,700
anybody have any questions so the
question is actually got asked to meet

454
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,420
at Derby Conn was could not do all of
this in burbs and just put it in

455
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,520
repeater well yes you can do all that
repeater but the whole point of what

456
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,619
we're talking about is when you
installed on a repeater how fast does it

457
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:38,890
send it out again the IDS finds it
you're done you've already been found

458
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,940
you also the speed I type at I'm
actually gonna be working on a program

459
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,230
that will work to show how slow people
can type I think it's actually a skill

460
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,480
to trip ideas

461
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:57,490
again here's the three of us up here if
you give Antonio some love for you said
