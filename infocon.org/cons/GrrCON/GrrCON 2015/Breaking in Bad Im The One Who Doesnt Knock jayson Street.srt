1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,380
paying attention to the words I guess
the good morning are calm things exactly

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,050
how I feel right now

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,620
great I'm glad we're on the same page
it's amazing I like to start off

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,990
specially after Chris's talk at I wanna
make sure that this this is my legal

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,260
disclaimer for any fed still in the
audience which they probably not they're

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,080
all out there now but there are this is
my legal disclaimer I am NOT a lawyer I

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,489
have played one on the internet before
successfully but I am NOT a lawyer so

8
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,489
but this is my legal disclaimer I
googled it off a new image search which

9
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:44,239
is where all get most my slide content
to and basically what this day is when

10
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,059
I'm hired to go and do bad things and
I'm gonna tell you some of the things

11
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,820
that I've done that are like really bad
really just horrible and mean and you're

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,329
like that's not nice chasing you should
not be so bad it's like just understand

13
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,570
something just remember the kitten I'm
adorable ok I will never tried to steal

14
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,250
you kill kill you still from you or
financially ruined you and she paid me

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,990
first ok there's always the contractor
for destruction happens ok I always stay

16
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,530
in scope it's like not casting you know
anybody else but I always stay in Scopus

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:25,180
III III do that and so when I'm on a job
it's like I'm doing really really bad

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,390
things but because he asked me to and I
just I'm just really good at being bad

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,909
for good reasons which you know bad
plays a lot of things in here this is my

20
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,500
slide just help me find the mouse there
is and this is true that was nice enough

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,670
to make for me

22
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:58,259
audio video and audio on it but the
titles covering the destructive sorry

23
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,820
baby yeah so the titles called Breaking
Bad basically when you do social

24
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,729
engineering talks and I've come across
this study i did some really weird crazy

25
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,099
things and I don't believe some of the
things that I've done it like him so

26
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,510
when i do research on certain devices as
hard as you can go and say here's a demo

27
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,030
of what I've done this is the actual
results of what I've done there it is

28
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,569
and I tell you stuff you know I come up
to you yeah I was open to hearing this

29
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,760
facility research and I'm like seven
storeys above the coziness I person I'm

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,310
trying to prove a point and so I climate
this event because it was the wrong way

31
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,530
and he was like right now he was like a
seven or not but I'm like in a certain

32
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,330
time so here I am come into the server
room that doesn't sound very believable

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,340
a picture of me doing that but it still
doesn't sound very believable it's like

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,609
so many stories like it's really hard to
see that this talk is basically trying

35
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,079
to show actual evidence of some of the
social engineering getting stuff done I

36
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,320
call it my dessert investable talk
because I do give you the same stories

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,140
at the beginning but then I talk about
some things that we need to do to be

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,940
better at protecting against them this
is a way to slide this is just basically

39
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
show you my twitter handles like that
I'd like my life there's there's way

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,970
more information out there on the
internet about me that I actually do

41
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:28,760
like so feel free to have added the one
day and I will say though I am tired of

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,390
APT I am tired of apt apt is basically a
company saying gas someone clicked on a

43
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,190
link in a phishing email but we got
shareholders to appease we don't talk to

44
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,799
me so it was advanced and they were very
persistent and by golly we felt

45
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:46,819
threatened

46
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,410
that's apt not given the corner we're
good right

47
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,480
forget that people talk about like will
end and other people when they try to

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,590
mitigate about going where they were
going up to the low hanging fruit yet

49
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,080
another thing that annoys me we talking
about attackers going up to low hanging

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,720
fruit is being honest with ourselves ok
did not going out to the low-hanging

51
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,740
fruit the free infringe on the ground
it's almost taking root that's where

52
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,830
you're from his people its mount up in
the dream don't give yourself that much

53
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,110
credit that you actually have on that
tree that low for someone agrees they

54
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:27,440
just have to reach down that's where our
food is let's start going after that

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,070
first and then we'll start worrying
about the tree little bit so that's one

56
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,120
of things that I get upset with it as
well because I don't try to do so I'm

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,150
the anti sophisticated person obviously
if you see me at any party you will

58
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,740
realize that is true but it's like I'm
the anti sophisticated person it's like

59
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,610
when it comes to happy I want to show
you this stuff is so easy even I can do

60
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,520
it so I using just walk into place and
just be bad

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,910
basic adorable destruction it's like no
preparedness I just go in let's go be

62
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,600
bad guys you know work for male and and
the rest of the crew of Serenity so it's

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,430
good enough for me

64
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,730
couple indicators a person doing bad
things one is recon mode it's only about

65
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,950
two hours the Google victims on website
know I've never used a full two hours of

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,790
four ever it's likely we'll talk about
story where I used the longest which was

67
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,400
an hour and 45 minutes

68
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,240
number two is a scene mode it's usually
walking into the victims occasion when

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,669
you note sometimes without doing number
one that's actually the first or why

70
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,370
talk about that three opponents moded
basically plug in the device into the

71
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,250
victim's computer network sometimes with
the help of their help really necessary

72
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,340
no but it's funny and you know I can't
resist so so I usually just ask them to

73
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,840
can you please guide your desk of them
trying to do some damage thank you I

74
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,790
appreciate that

75
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:57,130
not necessary paraphrasing 45 profit you
know custom check clears and I'm happy

76
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,590
they learned some valuable lessons on
their systems and so they're happy so

77
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,860
everybody's happy right

78
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,210
good thing there stream rolled I usually
go in when I'm breaking and I'm actually

79
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,860
going to show you in these stories those
different roles it's like one of the

80
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,849
tech repair guy the delivery guy the job
applicant customer or just wondering in

81
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:23,189
those are passive role that's where I'm
usually asking you when I encounter you

82
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,319
I'm asking you to help me so I'm trying
to do this from headquarters trial

83
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,060
examining you have a look at this real
quick

84
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,650
very possible trying to get in and try
to get them to actually help me do some

85
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,069
bad things which is definitely fun but
one key caveat though it's like when you

86
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:40,349
ever your doing these things make sure
you're going into something that you can

87
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:44,569
actually you know carry out never go win
as a plumber unless you know how to

88
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:50,849
plumb ok cuz you never know when they're
like he show up there I hombre ya the

89
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,319
drinks tonight I'm glad you're here and
we thought you would be here a few hours

90
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,199
10 let me go to my truck to get my
snakey rotor rooter device I'll be right

91
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:58,620
back

92
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,000
you leave in that's a fail so you gotta
come into something that you actually

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,139
know how to do a summer job applicants
i've got i've gone and apply for jobs

94
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,830
for programming cobalt Interior Design
I've come in first CPA once was like I'm

95
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,599
gone in for some really weird jobs never
got the job got their data so you know

96
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,229
we still win win situation three is
crazy off the wall personalities not

97
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,930
recommended but totally fun and they
usually work I have broken into a Palace

98
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,550
Hotel in the South of France and
barefoot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

99
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,860
pajama bottoms and a hacker t-shirt full
access to compromise of their internal

100
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,180
network underground underneath the thing
was full access and the funny part about

101
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,689
that was I didn't have a camera with me
to documented so I would walk by their

102
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:53,980
security cameras in the underground
complex and I'll just walk by going

103
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,160
walking through their stuff so they
weren't either but but it worked in a

104
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,790
documented by attack so I don't usually
go with the story time I decide what the

105
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,140
best way to do this because there's a
lot of different industries there's a

106
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,840
lot of different people that think that
world more secure it so that wouldn't

107
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,140
work there but we're still here so I
chose for these stories is like I chose

108
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,940
three different financial institutions
are related to financial institutions

109
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,150
because you know they do with money and
people have been known to go after you

110
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,780
know places that do with money because
you know there's money so so that's what

111
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,710
does the three targets are chosen chosen
in three different countries it's like

112
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,510
so you can get they will cycle that's a
cultural thing it is one place a couple

113
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,770
chose to different countries for this
and and I'm doing the three different

114
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,650
roles so let's see how successful and
how these worked out the first one is

115
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,700
called the beirut bank job this story is
so ridiculous that actually got turned

116
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,490
into a comic books trip and it was based
on the story wasn't only factual in the

117
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,760
comic it's like but all the actual
attacks were which is hilarious

118
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,850
basically I was hired by a bank in
Beirut Lebanon to break into their

119
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,790
branches and see if I could actually
commit online computer theft by having

120
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,320
physical access to their network devices
I explained it was like well for me to

121
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,740
do successfully to commit wire fraud are
trying to do something I would steal

122
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,410
millions from you because who wants to
jump changes in the drawer it's like I

123
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,590
want I want millions like I need about
five things I need to use her I D I need

124
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,250
a password on the smart card cuz he's a
smart cards for their computers cuz they

125
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:46,000
backed off inflation right there so I
can I need the computer and then I need

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,970
network access so I have to get all
those things like okay sure so the toll

127
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,060
fans me because you know I great people
every once in a while there's plenty of

128
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,010
witnesses here for that and so will we
want you to go and we're gonna take you

129
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,240
to three different locations

130
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,400
randomly

131
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,160
I don't know any of these locations
every single one of these locations I'm

132
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,220
going to these branches I'm going in
blind with no recon not even Google

133
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,350
Street map view I'm just going in and
Justin what happens so let's go in and

134
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,160
see what happens this is the first
branch

135
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,790
time from the first walked into the door
to full access to the bank two minutes

136
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:34,240
22 seconds from when I walked him never
knowing where this place was or where I

137
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,560
was going to its like before I had full
access to the bank branch installing

138
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,000
malware on the tellers machine two
minutes 20 seconds but I want to be a

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,910
little bit so it took a little longer so
you know don't judge me also please note

140
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,010
that I'm doing it in a black leather
DEFCON jacket and red Thundercat any

141
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,350
shoes I always come with warning labels
I'm not trying to blend in and trust me

142
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,630
in Beirut Lebanon it's like in this area
I wasn't blending in very well I walk in

143
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,510
drive into the office that's why I
walked down the hallway always walk I

144
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,990
know exactly where I'm going it's like
it doesn't matter if I have no clue it

145
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,300
has ended up into some dead in sin
staircases and then go anywhere in some

146
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,170
awkward conversations but that's cool
but this one actually worked out really

147
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,260
well went down this hallway there was
the general manager at someone's office

148
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,070
which is even better

149
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:34,180
backed up waited 30 seconds for his door
yes I've been there board was creepy but

150
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,380
I stayed there for 30 seconds and then I
started walking to the executive office

151
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,340
right missile what did she see she saw
this guy go into the manager's office

152
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,920
talk for 30 seconds and then come back
out and then I go to her and I said hey

153
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,550
I'm here with headquarters were looking
at the domain controllers make sure the

154
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,400
USB right and stuff or property access
to make sure there was no TCP reset

155
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,620
stepped on the IPB person I meet you for
something else actually having a problem

156
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,580
with the way that they were patrolling
the icp-ms he dumped so it's like you

157
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,860
know I just need to put this in real
quick don't mind every document just

158
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,610
awesome

159
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,880
take my camera with a picture of the
screen just to prove that was working I

160
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,600
need that for documentation thank you I
don't I'm good I'm done you should be

161
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,780
fine thank you go the next 1 I'm going
now everybody saw on the branch on the

162
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,320
talking to her stormy working on her
computer and then I'd go back to the

163
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,410
Italian deli by the telomere and I start
working out today I wanted to give him I

164
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,950
need access and please understand when I
say I had access to that wonderful Jones

165
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,190
right there with the frowny face he's
running because the stack next to hand

166
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:50,670
is actually the $250,000 he's depositing
while I was here

167
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:56,440
cash raffle sales are good I'm not going
to judge ok but he was depositing

168
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,900
$250,000 in cash at the time that I was
there so even if I wanted to be just

169
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,950
lazy and just like still the money and
get shot by you know him and security I

170
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,070
could have done that but that wasn't
respond so I would actually behind the

171
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,400
teller line by the time I was there with
ten minutes in the manager comes out

172
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,950
talk to the manager he thinks that the
people up front have berra fide me and

173
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,760
validated me because I'm behind the
teller line full access to our link in

174
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,110
the literally twirling in the chair you
know I was bored about ATT's so you know

175
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,410
how much you want to do you know so so
I'm doing that he comes out and it's

176
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,940
like and everybody assumes that he
verified me because I want to talk to

177
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,790
him first so he asked me if I will
what's going on what are you doing i

178
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,800
will like and I i got into the sunset
one here with headquarters in to make

179
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,590
sure that the machines are working
trying to make sure that everything's

180
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:52,790
working up to snap I'm glad you're here
it's like we got a problem with the

181
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,990
computer to take a look at it while not
a plumber

182
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,270
new desktop support so I'd over there to
guide computer and I look at it like you

183
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,070
know wat this computer that date is not
working right we'll get you a new one

184
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,270
from headquarters it's just another week
is something that should be here

185
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,430
his eyes lit up like a Christmas and
he's like we got another other scanner

186
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,140
here can come take a look at the scanner
sure

187
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,840
look at the scanner you know what best
working very well that's not you should

188
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,690
have that target anyone from
headquarters and he's like we got these

189
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,290
two monitors these two miners over here
and if I like you know what I wasn't

190
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,990
supposed to tell anybody but you cool
you know I like it's like I'm actually

191
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,320
hear from headquarters they should be
over here from america's of those were

192
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,940
actually doing the refurb all the
branches in lebanon and we're actually

193
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,510
putting all new equipment and we're
doing a whole refresh of the

194
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:56,600
architecture from coming over to test up
for you we've got a long while you're on

195
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,050
the top of the list two weeks but have
all new equipment on new monitors on

196
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,120
reform in the home perhaps baby it's all
yours is like and I'm telling you that

197
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,000
was one of the hardest moments I've ever
because I don't do red teaming I don't

198
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,180
go in and go here you know breaking into
everything destroyed almost upright

199
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,630
reports I do security awareness
engagements it's like I do social

200
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,770
engineering but exercises to help
educate employees so that means I go in

201
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:39,860
her unhappy and I leave for two minutes
I'll leave out the building 42 minute

202
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,950
what does that show I got away with it
right i didnt get followed I didn't get

203
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,960
captured its like I was able to
successfully absconded with the data so

204
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,220
this event and then when I come back I
go back in and I talked to every single

205
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,350
one of the people that I talk to the
nine countered and explain to them how

206
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm a horrible person and I'm a really
bad guy doing really bad things and they

207
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,770
shouldn't let bad guys like me do things
like that because you know the whole bad

208
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:15,570
stuff right so this this branch I have
to say so

209
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:21,200
so tragically horribly flawed that I
actually went to the branch was closed I

210
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,190
wouldn't the office and stuff you know
told the manager what happened way to

211
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,950
the office 'cause have one executive who
spoke Arabic so we could translate into

212
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,090
Arabic so they would totally understand
and two different languages how horribly

213
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,170
this happened and stuff you know in what
occurred and so I'm doing this and that

214
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,220
halfway through my conversation that
telling them things that need to worry

215
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:52,740
about the bank manager raises hand and
I'm like yes it does that mean we're not

216
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:05,510
gonna get the computers and I'll I know
horrible person do you mean bad this is

217
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:13,660
what I do and it's like and he's like a
puppy you will horrible I feel really

218
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,940
bad about that one and that's not even
the worst I've done we'll talk about

219
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,850
that one later it's like myself really
bad for the guy but I need to go in

220
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,060
there I need to do these bad things
right and I was in there for over 20

221
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:33,820
minutes you can look at the time stamp I
had full access to this bank for over 20

222
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:46,410
minutes no identification no I D no
numbers to call nothing and thanks to

223
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,340
snappy sweater vest dude I got a user I
D and i got

224
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,110
password well I knew the smart card to
house an easy password and even the

225
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:04,360
smart card so he gave back to me as well
so now I have a user I D a password in

226
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,950
smart card I need to other things
correct what were those two days

227
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,400
computer and Internet network access
we'll likely I've got two more branches

228
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,800
too busy right I had to be honest with
you I went to the next branch and I just

229
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,250
chill pill in really bad about the first
one i felt really bad the way I lied to

230
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,620
me i i really abused your trust in them
again I am at heart a good guy right so

231
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,600
I felt bad about so this morning I did a
little bit different I walked into the

232
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,070
branch I knew where I was going to stop
you know ended up to the the breaker in

233
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,720
which was actually did call because
there was a water cooler now I was

234
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,890
thirsty cusp owning people you know

235
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,060
thirsty work so I took a little water
SAT there for about you know you know

236
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,690
just recollection then I calmly walk
into behind the teller area coming I'm

237
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,840
not coming in from the outside now
coming from the inside walking to the

238
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,540
teller area and I then proceeded to go
behind why this guy right there to

239
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,980
working next to me and stuff you know

240
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:11,180
doing his job come up behind him and I
unplug and still the computer I did not

241
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:19,010
say a word to anyone cuz I didn't hurt
feelings so I just without saying

242
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,780
anything just walked in and literally
stole the computer from behind the

243
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:29,420
teller line and walked out with it so
now I have a user I D a password is

244
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,870
smart card and their computer I only
need one thing elsewhere I ask

245
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,320
yourselves how hard was it to get
internal network access at the next

246
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,250
branch easy very sadly easy right

247
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,320
so that's how that worked

248
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,669
that right there shows the flaw it's
like because people if I want to go in

249
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:57,570
there and we'll talk more about
education labor let's face it let's be

250
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,289
honest these were not stupid people if I
would have shown up in a ski mask and a

251
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:11,600
shotgun I want to have a really bad day
because we train our tellers to handle

252
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,860
those situations family we trained to
handle the geek with the USB Drive just

253
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,889
a lack of training that they're getting
what's causing the law not the human

254
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:27,169
themselves that's why I hate that
teacher says you know social engineering

255
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,210
expert cuz there's no password human
stupidity that's not that's not the

256
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:36,570
problem the problem is not training to
humans that's the patch we're just not

257
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,740
apply it and we can still keep bringing
the computer that the computers of all

258
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:48,059
the humans at all so you know 20 now so
let's go to the next one so this next

259
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,000
one is actually done in the you s
actually had the opportunity to break

260
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,299
into a state treasury I can't think name
what state because they are still

261
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:01,590
totally pissed me so we're going to go
there but I actually was brought in

262
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,960
after they'd already successfully just
networking are just as we broke into

263
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,470
their network and the center of your
people were going like yeah but how

264
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,210
would you go to get an access to get
that kind of access until they call me

265
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,990
the hey Jason you state treasurer Mike
sure that sounds cool let's try it and I

266
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,870
start by doing an assessment of their
head course their headquarters will also

267
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,529
remember I'm looting guy it's like like
to I love the defense's day at a very

268
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:34,080
good hardened headquarters you don't
like the double pane glass they had like

269
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,899
hard to see through if you post up some
might notice that during the day the

270
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:42,490
stuff you know it's like they had a
lobby that had like a door to get in

271
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,769
before you get into the actual internal
area it was merely good sound

272
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:51,309
architecture buried the marchers one
pointing to the windows it was like they

273
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:56,039
did some really good security aspects
right I'm like that's awesome I didn't

274
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,760
find one building in it it's like it be
going to the basement there was a break

275
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,470
room cap

276
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,350
very content with a storage area and I
can give in to the gym in the storage

277
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,200
area lock and given to that and there
was a dumb way too because this was

278
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,980
originally the state treasury
headquarter was just dumb waiter that

279
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,630
went from the basement to the first more
the state treasury and they didn't have

280
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:21,289
any locks on it so I was like I can
totally get in there but then I opened

281
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,169
the door and there were spiders and I
was not allowed a flamethrower so

282
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,799
therefore it was impenetrable and I was
not able to get into the headquarters so

283
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,650
they won that round ok it's like I mean
what am I going to do so so i cant I

284
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,890
actually talking like I can't break it
got really good security good glad to

285
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,159
get spiders yeah you got me on this one

286
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:50,110
you win this round but they had an
office a suite in an office building 50

287
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,520
miles away from where the headquarters
were that's also because we like to

288
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,409
think physically and not logistically
that's it that's not doesn't have to be

289
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:05,150
secured because it's not in the
headquarters right physically dot

290
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:11,059
correct would just take Lee you have
that connected internally straight into

291
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:15,830
your internal network through a VPN
extranet I would be sitting right next

292
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,960
to the State Treasurer if I was in that
office building

293
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,370
logistically so I'm gonna go after that
maybe it's like and that's when scope

294
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:34,799
comes in because I love to stay attack
of like an attacker would we want to see

295
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,230
how we handle an attacker Scopus this
ride this is an attacker's go you know

296
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,230
kitchen think that P I am going after
you write it might be wise I'm gonna

297
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,780
make fun of me now so kitchen sink you
know boom throughout everything right

298
00:23:51,780 --> 00:24:01,240
with a client goes as much acting like
an attacker would ok I'm ready for

299
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,640
Monday through Friday

300
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,110
you know cuz I'm going to share their
response team is available to be able to

301
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,970
handle to come up with any issues or
something like that attack us like an

302
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,179
attacker would make sure I'll do that

303
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,789
but can you make sure that you're not
doing it till after midnight cuz we

304
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:23,509
don't have to use your hands up and down
time I'm like ok sure but acts like an

305
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,830
attacker would ok fine don't usually go
to the protection service or just

306
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,320
because I'm really passionate get the
software we got this developer server

307
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,309
set me on this one i Peter to go after
that would be totally great thank you go

308
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:42,149
after the attack of welcome attacker
would end their scope one this

309
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:49,470
engagement my scope was this they wanted
me to go after that office building and

310
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:56,639
a tackle you had to do it after 5:30 in
the evening ok I wasn't allowed to use

311
00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:01,779
my favorite tools are gaining entry you
know either cardboard or chrome are you

312
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,419
know cardboard I used for the sensors to
you open the motions engine open up and

313
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:13,039
crowbars well it's mandatory correct so
you know i'm not i'm not the aging aight

314
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,450
I'm not I'm not gonna do lock pick set
well but I'm really good with cardboard

315
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,549
i've actually successfully broke into a
place with a paper airplane I'm very

316
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:24,029
proud of that moment so it's like so but
they would let me have those and there

317
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:27,999
are couple other factors from our rules
of engagement I will be able to talk to

318
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,799
anyone coming out of the building
because they may not be state treasury

319
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,309
employees so I couldn't risk it and talk
to them cause that would be route so i

320
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:39,149
cant talking about coming out of the
building but if I happen to get in

321
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:42,779
well then I can only stay in the public
areas because you know that was all I'm

322
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,350
in scope to do because it's like they're
trying to break into their place

323
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,850
nowhere else and I'm like well I didn't
plan on breaking the vending machines

324
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,529
would actually legit I'm cool with that
and then I will you can only talk to the

325
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,840
cleaners but they're not direct
employees in the state writers and

326
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,600
therefore they're not in the contract
with therefore you can't lie to them

327
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,460
don't know what ya that would just not
be fair

328
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,879
yeah we don't want to a criminal to be
fair do we not fare so it's like let's

329
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:18,780
let's do it let's get worked out for him
this is Jason knows cam

330
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,480
so here it is I'm thereafter the
building that dates are all messed up

331
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,710
this only find one that would when it
was ago the first north side door I

332
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:39,260
tried the door no cardboard no crowbar
very sad cuz it's locked and is the best

333
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,610
part of the whole video I promise
because what you get to watch me walking

334
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,900
this way I get to drink that's because
this is a long as part of the exploit

335
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:57,210
sorry for the Dramamine inducing video
I'm wearing a wristwatch when recording

336
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,750
all this video its my geek bling bling

337
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:07,230
hi-def video recorder with 16 gig USB
hard drive so I get to the front of the

338
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,250
door area and I realize that the doors
locked

339
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:16,380
are so why do they put up my hacking
tool for acting like I'm doing something

340
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,750
Angry Birds but that helps because only
after a while I'm here looking at my

341
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,570
device like I'm doing some kind
important business thing right cause I'm

342
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,370
a business person cannot get a
smartphone it's like I wait 10 seconds

343
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:41,770
and and that ten seconds I lost a group
of pigs but she came out I was helpful

344
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:48,679
fair and I didn't say anything to you

345
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,820
how many places I've compromised just by
holding a phone or acting like I was

346
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,159
talking to someone and that someone
walked out without making eye contact

347
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,360
why would I do this one building to
another country and it was horrible

348
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,779
because I actually had to be stuck in
the floors in between the divorce I did

349
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,090
like six or seven fours but I would
borrowing someone else's phone calls the

350
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:18,110
country did install Angry Birds so I
mean I did have nothing to this one was

351
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:27,419
the work now I'm inside for two hours
I'm in the public for two guys you are

352
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,460
totally underestimated my HDD

353
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,429
locked inside a building for two hours
there's only so many tweets you can

354
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,499
Tweet status as you can like an angry
bird you can flip in two hours

355
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:45,480
my battery was a 2% we were in dire
situations here ok so actually after

356
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,789
would like it was like oh my gosh was it
was it was horrible so about two hours I

357
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:55,480
hear the cleaning lady upstairs I'm
going to myself through it if it's

358

360
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:35,879

361
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:39,500

373
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:40,480
at this one probably have actually yeah
so I'm on the phone with someone

374
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,519
actually talking to an employee and even
if I wasn't talking to someone I wish to

375
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:51,039
act because as soon as they come in when
am I gonna say to someone's coming in to

376
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,999
give me to help on something I'm

a conversation you've got to keep ok I'm

378
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:05,960
good thing you acknowledge oh I don't
need your help finding more person of

379
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,799
authority and stuff this person just

380
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,899
don't have to worry about it Thursday be
your step thank you for that and so that

381
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:18,009
person is a kind of 2010 I wasn't going
to let them in

382
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:21,570
someone else was about to let him in
anyway so it's totally legit totally

383
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:33,739
cool right and that's all that work that
was the only lie I do feel bad about

384
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:35,230
that one

385
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:41,850
I thought I'd see you later I didn't see
you are you ok my bad what purpose does

386
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,330
it serve for them to have a scope like
that who did that

387
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:51,610
if it means I have a great local stories
and stuff like that benefit the

388
00:32:51,610 --> 00:33:00,190
declining know all it did was reinforce
the idea of an attacker as motivation

389
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,850
and determination they're getting in
what are you doing to protect him what

390
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,909
are you doing to detect it that's what
we need to start working on more so this

391
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:16,130
next one is just one of those I have no
idea how this worked there's no way you

392
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,960
should be believing me right now I mean
I have actually talked to people in a

393
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,409
hallway it's like in a chemical research
thing and I'm telling him some of the

394
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:30,389
stupid stuff is coming out of my mouth
and i'm looking at them like I can tell

395
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:35,389
you don't believe me I just had a whole
bunch of crap but you're still not in

396
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:41,409
your head and saying it's ok there's a
problem here and then I walk away and

397
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:45,909
you know what the former it's like I'm
literally had physical security officers

398
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:51,299
actually help me carry servers out of
the computer room later helped me myself

399
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:55,460
and put them in my car

400
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,090
not cool right from a defensive
standpoint so this is one of those

401
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,899
stories this is in Kingston Jamaica
would like where I was doing a financial

402
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:12,010
institution and this is probably one of
the worst things I've ever done on an

403
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,849
engagement done some really shady stuff
all over but it's like this is one that

404
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:21,099
you really bad about ok I call this one
the Jason the terrible horrible no good

405
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:27,060
very bad social engineering engagement
because me and there was this one also I

406
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,379
want to make sure that I i point out
that this man was not just me just going

407
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:31,250
solo

408
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,599
there was actually a team of guys like
there was a team of guys in Jamaica that

409
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:37,169
was from the security company that hired
me to come down

410
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:42,419
and take a look at it that was helping
with it and we were looking for the the

411
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:48,169
main aspect of trying to get into this
company and so the whole team like we

412
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,319
spent an hour and 45 minutes that also
happens to be the longest I've ever

413
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:57,339
searched on Google for any attack an
hour and 45 minutes on Google is like

414
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:01,790
that is a long as I've ever done recon
on a company to get a GED usually it's

415
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:08,380
not that needed so we went around two
hours at I can then we developed a first

416
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:16,559
wanted to come in it's like I came in as
a TV producer because they actually had

417
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,790
a charity organization that had the same
email address domain which meant they

418
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:29,270
were on the same network which means
they were in scope so why go after this

419
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,990
big scary financial institution when I
can go out to the nice helpful people at

420
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,299
the charity organization remember I'm a
bad guy so we decided to that one the

421
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:43,770
team members gets the calls initiation
called helms like there's a TV producer

422
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,720
from america doing a show on
corporations doing public good in the

423
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,290
communities like Jamaica and their
companies doing such a great public

424
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:55,380
works they wanna we won't put them on
television so then he transferred the

425
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,790
phone over to me and i was just talking
he said that y'all were like doing this

426
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,690
wonderful things you were doing it was
just amazing and I'm like I gotta have

427
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,359

like my flight leaves at 6 a.m. it's

428

429
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:17,220

foster homes I can't guarantee no this

430
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,500

minutes before the appointment at the

432
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,230

the building and the office but it was

433
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,190

the street

434
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,059
financial headquarters were knocked on
the other side I go to Fort Knox birds

435
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:47,030
going like I'm here I'm trying to meet
with some people might like

436
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,070
and there to get into the building

437
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,510
you have to be buzzed in from the lady
the receptionist then you have to go

438
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,220
through this lobby to this other armored
or stuff you know that led you into the

439
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,560
atrium to the to the financial area I
mean it was the most comfortable man

440
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,860
trapped have ever seen

441
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,790
ok and there was a guy there that they
paid extra to look really mean ugly it's

442
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,200
like i don't want you still scares me to
this day so just very mean we'll go with

443
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,590

444
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:19,590
ok and I told him I'm here to build it
does the wrong we're in the wrong

445
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:25,570
building across the street to get there
ok go to the restroom real quick it's

446
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,360
like how do you talk to him and make
sure that it is not gonna do some

447
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:37,310
factors because I get lost so many times
I'm looking for the restroom is just

448
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:42,090
amazing I was in this one building in
the West Coast of this facility and I

449
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,420
will offer two hours trying to find out
about the employer in the server room

450
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,890
with no pro but I could not find that it
was a perplexing so so they say yes you

451
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:59,170
can go there when the door opens up
we're going to continue to walk behind

452
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,280
me and I'm like I am literally scared at
this moment of the sky is falling into

453
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,490
the stall ok I mean that was a factor to
consider at this point ok but he stopped

454
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:14,620
at the at the door so I'm like ok that's
convenient and I get into the bathroom

455
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,930
and I'm just going realization that will
crap I really don't have to go through

456
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:24,320
right now so now I just have to stand
there for the proper linkable urination

457
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,380
period and stuff ride like okay that's
good enough then I have to go over to

458
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,850
wash my hands because you know I don't
think I'm gonna hygienic even though

459
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,010
nothing occurred and then I walk out
there as soon as I walk out head toward

460
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:49,380
the elevators and there's the guy but
trust me from Fraser expressions and

461
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,400
body language it was implied ok it was
literally

462
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,630
you over here so I'm like oh yes of
course I'm going that way so I talked to

463
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,819
the lady the management lady and we
talked and five minutes into my you know

464
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:07,950
what I need to talk to you like an
executive summary that this been here

465
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,640
before it can do that and I sure like I
did talk to them talk to about five

466
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,390
minutes by the TV shows are you know
what I can tell you all the stuff about

467
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,460
what we do for this episode what I can
do I can show you that USB Drive with

468
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,549
such as 12 videos on it from one the
shoes that we done ignore the roberto Di

469
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:29,049
Natale plugin boom i plug it in and what
a weird things that happened today all

470
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:32,410
these freakin weird error message
started popping up this other stuff

471
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,170
start going on i mean literally this
guy's machine was Soho's I think it was

472
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,510
other malware fighting with my where
malware like you know it's like I was

473
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,730
here first you get your own computer
like no one thing too bad you can't do

474
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:49,240
it like fighting each other it was
really bad and I'm like

475
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,900
and the guideline walk he really want to
see this video so I can give it to the

476
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,750
desktop support guy and the desk support
guys not in scope and I'm like crap like

477
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,829
but you know 90 percent of social
engineering is thinking on your feet

478
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:05,079
quickly so I'm like well there are other
videos on a USB Drive that I need to see

479
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,329
so you need to let me go with them so I
can figure out where he put it on the

480
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,619
show he's not accessing your folders
there are no photos tortured on these

481
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:15,589
USB Drive I need to see what computer he
put it into because that is now my

482
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:20,410
computer and that's now designated as a
target in so I have to go looking for

483
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:27,930
bottom so I go into it is a work area
swat group in the machine the USB Drive

484
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:33,880
into a reboot your machine and I'm like
that is so thankful I go to the thing

485
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,420
for Windows so I don't worry and then I
learned something really awesome but he

486
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,710
is great because it worked perfectly
just like it was on Windows machine it

487
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:52,910
executed it randy was also and I'm like
oh i've got domain admin their company

488
00:40:52,910 --> 00:41:00,000
in every company in this case reports
which sort of unfortunate but also so so

489
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,270
I'm to play that out

490
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,310
and so now I have to sit down and this
is the worst part about it

491
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,510
ok I'm not being facetious I'm not
trying to be funny

492
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:14,830
gentlemanly also wonderful caring human
beings that we're trying to make their

493
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,600
communities better than i mean this lady
gave me a copy of her book is like the

494
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,120
mother theresa of Jamaica ok and I spent
the next 15 minutes in the room with

495
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,490
these people explaining to them how I
was going to put them on television

496
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:34,980
yes I see that judgment i i agree it's
like he was bad but actually pathway you

497
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,690
to it I started it wow someone like
really judgemental admitted it was bad

498
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,290
so it's like so I'm like halfway into a
do I start getting involved and I'm like

499
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:47,250
ok we're going to do I feel blame
working at a computer working in your

500
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,440
office is like working the computer
working on a desk doing work and it's

501
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,930
gonna fade out its gonna pay and over
and the transition and Butler and is

502
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,960
gonna go out onto the streets in Jamaica
and there's just young girls tuxedo is

503
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,580
being fed by that same day that was on
her computer she is now on the street

504
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,930
actually feeding a child because it
shows how the world do you do when

505
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,880
you're in your office actually
translates to actual posit action in the

506
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,170
street it's gonna show that we're trying
to bring that to like i mean if I could

507
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,910
show it actually looks like so I can be
installed by TV we're all doing grade

508
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,610
second another appointment set up a
couple months medfly down with the film

509
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,110
crew it was amazing

510
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:37,200
horrible cuz I walk out of the building
and I'm there by two minute spent three

511
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,640
minutes pass top five minutes my team
members that drives over and he's like

512
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,910
Jason aren't you going back inside cuz
he was working with me as I will work in

513
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,000
the two previous day so he knew what was
going on

514
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,110
go out to miss come back in and I was
like no I can't tell those people would

515
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,870
I just hit

516
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,480
and I'm literally for the first time
ever I actually had to call the client

517
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:13,780
and I was like yeah I'm finished but you
gotta tell them what occurred i I can't

518
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:19,290
do it I can't tell those people and
those wonderfully sweet people not gonna

519
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:26,310
make me I can do it and do the actual
guy who contracted actually had to tell

520
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:31,910
them because it was really bad so I
usually have ice cream after I celebrate

521
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:37,410
their success we destroy someone or
doing good talk and yet I don't have ice

522
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:42,360
cream but didn't taste as good so for
the record was a little bitter ok so I

523
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,430
do feel bad about that the summary once
again is human nature

524
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:50,790
we'd like to believe the lie that
everybody everybody in this building I

525
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,850
got suckered in stuff recently is tough
because I want to believe that this

526
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,830
person was actually being truth will set
you know and they were not it's human

527
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,880
nature we want to believe what's going
on so if I can give you a convenient lie

528
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,480
of why did you plug a USB Drive in it is
better than what you know the true

529
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,820
probably to be which is something bad is
happening to you I'm flying out on a

530
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,580
plane tomorrow I am NOT going up on that
plane the stuff you know in the first

531
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,830
thing I think of my brain I got a great
to first class of crap chris is on the

532
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,050
plane we're gonna die it's like Justin
horrible but I don't think of things

533
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,440
like that those are pleasant thoughts

534
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,290
those who want to thank the unpleasant
things no one goes to work going on is a

535
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:38,330
great job stuff we know it's probably a
shot or someone you know is I know so if

536
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,040
I can give you a convenient lie is
better than you having to realize

537
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:48,750
horribly got dressed died Sept might
actually need me harm he may be lying

538
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:53,180
about that USB Drive if we don't want to
believe that so we need to start doing

539
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,820
something to make him believe this this
is the best part of it is also your real

540
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,020
hard to realize it's a very long talk
about will put this in here so you have

541
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:08,410
to agree with me dude seriously its like
and boring you forgot boring Jason so we

542
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:12,869
also do better education with our
employees we got 23 educate

543
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:17,309
and power and enforce let's talk about
education I touched on a little bit it's

544
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:23,089
like and want to keep things is we teach
people that this is bad well not those

545
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:25,900
guys in the lower because they're
adorable but you know we change that

546
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,640
that these guys are bad right but we
don't talk about how sketchy these

547
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,259
people are such that upper left-hand got
there and you know he's gonna sketching

548
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:40,359
that one and reviving the check against
these devices to these are devices that

549
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:46,720
are gonna get you it's like not just
those got those those are awesome that's

550
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,079
why I love those because you know Mr
Obeid just those in the parking lot who

551
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,480
does that anymore that's old school when
I go on to an engagement I come with a

552
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,539
stack of inti envelopes and a marker and
I walked through those little hallway

553
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:07,499
cubicles too I think someone is not
there but they've got a nameplate write

554
00:46:07,499 --> 00:46:12,269
their name on the envelope with a USB
Drive in the envelope you know sit up

555
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:18,930
nice and tight put it on their death
who's not opening that envelope and

556
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:23,470
playing the USB Drive that's directed to
them into the computer that was left on

557
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:29,049
their desk so it was obviously someone
totally legit right now they're also and

558
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:32,720
they're so cheap because you know every
conference usually have so what we need

559
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,119
to do we need to teach employing dangers
employees don't care about your data

560
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:42,640
employees are never going to care about
your data they don't need to secure the

561
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,609
wifi at home they don't know where your
children are going online and on

562
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:50,710
Facebook and Instagram kickin whatever
else is out there Paris coping whenever

563
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:57,170
they don't know those things like I feel
so just saying those things ok it's like

564
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,970
so why and there's no hiding scheme with
craigslist and ebay scams and phishing

565
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:06,849
attempts to stop trying to teach
employees to worry about your data start

566
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:10,539
teaching your employees should be
security conscious at home have lessons

567
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:15,579
and give out lessons or educational
seminars

568
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:19,299
employs about how to protect their wifi
at home show them how to do the privacy

569
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:21,609
settings on Facebook and other social
media

570
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:25,849
show them the dangers that children face
online show them how to respond to

571
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:31,009
phishing attacks at home in craigslist
ads at home and in scams on ebay shown

572
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:34,749
them all those things and get what's
going to happen they're still not gonna

573
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:40,910
care about your data but they're gonna
be security conscious they're gonna see

574
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:45,099
dat attack at work and they're gonna
realize I'm not gonna fall for that at

575
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:48,869
home I'm not gonna fall forward here I
should report something I know then you

576
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,200
need to create teachable moments for
them

577
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,999
security we can actually do attack and
some people have a hard time throughout

578
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:02,089
what is a good teachable moment so I'm
here to help I don't want to convert

579
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:05,829
that I go to now it's like I usually do
two different methods of attack and

580
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:09,329
stuff you know to the audience to show
them a teachable moment to help make it

581
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:17,579
is understood I'm sure I will go and I
will have wifi hack my pineapple running

582
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:22,130
and I just took control of all the
machines one word of advice do not do

583
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,170
this when you don't actually realize who
all the other people are speaking at the

584
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:32,670
event that your act was that a PC where
I did not look at the schedule and I put

585
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,279
this sucker up and I got like over
almost a hundred people connected to it

586
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:39,880
and I'm feeling really good about myself
in the first person comes on and speaks

587
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,819
and then he introduces the next speaker
right before me who was Mike Morrell X

588
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:50,999
deputy director of the CIA awkward I was
like very soon as I heard that way who

589
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:57,009
let me look on here that's not good so
the other one that I do is I wear these

590
00:48:57,009 --> 00:49:00,999
classes where it's like I can do video
recordings are high debt crisis to show

591
00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:05,450
you that sometimes the low low low tech
attack where I can gather your data I

592
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:08,660
can look through your stuff just by
wearing glasses or a pin or some kind of

593
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,150
ice and I recorded that way I don't have
to steal it from a USB Drive I'm

594
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,880
actually recording of the day to the
nineteen do you know that I'm not

595
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:23,400
wearing glasses that because I did this
this is Kirk on Hyde Park on this was

596
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,900
less than five minute at this conference
I had no internet connectivity to my

597
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,480
machine I'm not trying to hack any body
know data went through my machine

598
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,609
if you actually during that period tried
to go to a web browser to any website it

599
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:43,410
would actually say oops not the wifi you
were looking for my bad with the winky

600
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,990
face I know because I made that page so
any page that you would try to go to

601
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:54,869
would be that one so also lindsey is
like you connected to Big Brother you're

602
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:58,030
in their part of the Illuminati or
you're a victim of it I'm just let you

603
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:04,580
know fYI ok that one really scared me so
big brothers like obviously up to no

604
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,100
good

605
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,750
ok I'm just so so that's good con that
is what's called a teachable moment

606
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:16,510
because all your reactions are like oh
crap just got real that's what you need

607
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,820
to do your employees

608
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:24,590
that's the moment you have to give them
back to empower your employees you have

609
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:28,660
to show your employees how they can
impact and become a positive force for

610
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:32,160
good they are not part of your problem

611
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,570
the partner solution you have access to
the biggest intrusion detection system

612
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:41,220
in the history because they do they're
saying job day in and day out today also

613
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,240
realized part of her job you've been
part of information security

614
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,720
I wasn't a bank in Amman Jordan play him
I wipe my USB Drive and the bank manager

615
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,010
is telling me you can't do that so i my
whole response the whole entire tribe

616
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,880
was like you're right I should be doing
that that's you should call someone

617
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,190
don't you have someone to call I know I
should be yeah I know I should be here

618
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:09,390
and stuff you know it's totally legit
for me being here because I know but you

619
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,770
don't know I'm here than I don't think I
should be reading this you know you

620
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,260
should be putting these devices it if
you don't know it's like somebody

621
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,070
someone like this

622
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:24,770
sketchy if you didn't know I mean I know
I'm a good guy right cuz it's like it

623
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:33,119
says on my bad I mean bad by prime-time
plug that in juneau having my call this

624
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,240
corporation for enterprise have an
extension for whenever an employee see

625
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,100
something suspicious or suspicious
emails or activities they know who to

626
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,880
call and they're rewarded or
acknowledged for the fact that they did

627
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,069
that

628
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:52,219
that's not a blinking box device people
that's not make misdeeds that's an

629
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:56,640
extension to you can give your employees
to give them a outreach to actually help

630
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,459
me an active part of information
security team that's when the main

631
00:52:00,459 --> 00:52:04,239
things that are needed but you gotta
give them the opportunity to do the

632
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:07,199
right thing and reward them when they
succeed and teach when they fell don't

633
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:10,799
make it worth I can be like a total all
your horrible person cuz you didn't

634
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:11,630
catch it

635
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:18,410
accentuate the positive and we gotta do
is in force you I do enforcement it's

636
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:23,130
not just negative reinforcement deposit
reported but when the key things i wanna

637
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,499
talk about as I could I'm running out of
time here and people already look at the

638
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:31,709
watches are probably hungry cuz I know I
am going to last one visibility is

639
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:36,420
sometimes it's all that that's important
and when the kingdom of visibility is we

640
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,829
do not usually translate online action
to real-world consequences correct

641
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:45,839
that's when the hardest part for people
understand that things that they do

642
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:52,019
online have repercussions the links they
click links they click there we go I can

643
00:52:52,019 --> 00:52:55,949
talk English it's like those have
consequences I played video games like

644
00:52:55,949 --> 00:53:00,729
Call of Duty right I love call of duty
to wait for you know november 6 new one

645
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:06,039
coming out but I'm not one of those guys
who was like ok ok to recover sniper in

646
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:10,029
the left wing to come around with heavy
weapons fires have been recovering from

647
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:13,410
from the northwest like this map
actually has two dead men trapped inside

648
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:18,160
me know so I want the guys with many
guys to come into that no one does that

649
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:31,789
i'm gonna it's like you know what
happens when I die I would respond I

650
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:39,680
promise you I get at least five kills to
Mike 25 deaths ok my teammates me do I

651
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,420
care I'm having a blast

652
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:49,839
electrodes to my body when i get a
thousand jolt every time I get shot in

653
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,600
the game how am I gonna play this

654
00:53:53,600 --> 00:54:05,520
in my real life

655
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:11,900
behavior will be modified so you have to
create that that shit they see when a

656
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,400
virus outbreak goes out when someone
falls to phishing email show up at the

657
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:23,260
desk showed him real world repercussions
show them the action of a security thing

658
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:28,800
was that maybe noon foreign concept to
create outreach and that's how you

659
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,170
enforce it and I'm gonna ended
unbelievably six months before interest

660
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:38,210
in it which is rare for me I'm gonna do
with this

661
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,130
giving this talk to security people
because I want you to understand

662
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:49,020
something I hated the show sorry guys
but I hated the show you the bad guy why

663
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:54,520
we're so happy when the bad guy succeeds
why we're so happy watching the bad guy

664
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:00,130
get away with doing bad things our job
is to make you have less of a happy day

665
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:05,700
it's like not wait for him to
self-destruct but to actually catch and

666
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,640
stop him from doing the things that he
was doing that so we should get back to

667
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,910
television know whatever that's the way
I feel about it glad he died sorry it's

668
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:21,910
like that that's a show that's the way I
feel as a blue team in a red team guy so

669
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:41,829
I believe it that that is not even a
typo I am done

670
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:50,910
food and other talks and other speakers
that are probably more educational maybe

671
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:51,749
we can meet around
