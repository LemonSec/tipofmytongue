1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,650
can you guys hear back there good over
there but over here he has hear me also

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:13,469
so welcome back touring get before we
start this legal stuff out the way the

3
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,390
views and opinions expressed herein are
my own and no way represent the views

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,220
positions or opinions expressed or
implied by my employer's future past and

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,869
present it and besides I can also change
my mind so thank you guys for coming

6
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:33,360
it's really awesome to see more than 20
people here this early in the morning of

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,500
the party last night was pretty awesome
and never did hear where that after

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,930
after party was but says that only a few
people really look for that I stuck to

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,460
its way into the hours to go to my
facebook feed and people are still going

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,289
strong at 678

11
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:54,680
ok I'd like to see you this morning but
I'm so yeah I'm John Menard do fun

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,250
things that NetSuite security dragon
there and we get to break into staff

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,010
also get to build stuff and long time
ago certainly can I just realize wow

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,290
there's no about information on their
offensive side but also on the defensive

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,259
side not much there but you know it is
what it is said I just share this with

16
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:23,810
you guys and yes we'll get a few ideas
to help ticket I'm white hat or black

17
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,549
hat side so we should go back touring
get as you might imagine we're not

18
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,799
really gonna be talking about entire
software development lifecycle

19
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,509
variations like SourceForge loops by
default you know back during executables

20
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,200
with what some people people as malware
but others paid advertising teachers and

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,480
sales and profits as you might imagine

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,540
I could see here and talk for hours but
all the different source code management

23
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,050
solutions out there

24
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,070
wikipedia has a pretty good page I'm
sure they're flame wars on PRWeb is

25
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:09,240
Windows or Linux better but for the most
part just go there take a look and then

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,920
lastly functionality burst back door
really depends on your point of view

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,420
email going to the OpenBSD list way back
in the day where this individual who was

28
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,120
contracted to work and crypto
functionality for the PSD project in

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,550
particular the DEP and set up which is
used by the everywhere you guys might

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:40,960
remember it as OpenVPN used like a mi
NDAA deceased but the FBI by the way

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,990
they paid myself and others to introduce
back doors we can crypto

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,950
in their project here the developers
take a look at their commit sin review

33
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,720
it so some people would be like a that's
a backdoor FBI and others who say

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,390
functionalities so for arguments of
purposes just thinking the same as a

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:08,959
negative outcome that you do not want
their support is when I was looking back

36
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,940
to the day which SEM should I pick what
should I really poke at you know what

37
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,620
helped me because there was really
nothing really useful out there tom

38
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,480
cruise who knows might imagine was very
helpful but one thing is I realize

39
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,050
immediately early on was there the right
tools for the job

40
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,730
there's also the wrong tools for the job
but the wrong tools might imagine these

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,340
Top Gear presenters will show something
that isn't so nice

42
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,970
audio working

43
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:49,470
that felt most what happened to the
corner of the house and now basically

44
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:56,370
the whole house on your head engine
running

45
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,300
winds damaged tank ouch

46
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:12,700
himself was still trapped inside because
I finally house trained my machine

47
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:23,380
I was able to mount a rescue

48
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:30,880
tank

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,370
the professional ranks

50
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,060
obviously

51
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,180
to try and catch up decided to dig even
deeper into the military enjoyable

52
00:04:42,180 --> 00:05:00,340
explosives in the house going to stand
back to do you know more

53
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:09,050
is that the city's piles

54
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:31,110
that failure we decided just to use all
machines as battery

55
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,340
using military vehicles ran into
buildings probably not the right tool

56
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,140
but as you might imagine when you have a
hammer everything is the nail so let me

57
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,800
start doing Office documents and things
like that collaboratively well people

58
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,790
would use a wiki so people actually try
to use revision control software but in

59
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:58,460
particular source code management or sen
per short that's meant for handling

60
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:06,530
source code not documents not binary
files not images or artifacts or movies

61
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,440
are extremely large files they made all
the right choices for source code and

62
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,080
small piece attacks and not gigantic
files and only recently could get handle

63
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,020
adequately you know 23 gate files and
that sort but they are super racer

64
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,500
digging further into a deeper was that
there were only two different process

65
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,230
models or workflow models yet the
traditional one source of truth the

66
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,030
Gateway enforcer everyone had to
interact with us if you're on the other

67
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,180
side of the world too bad so sad

68
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,480
traffic at all we do the other side of
the world communicate them push and pull

69
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,800
which ok fine but if you're constantly
refreshing down on gigs at a time that's

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,940
not really acceptable so people start
going more to a distributed model where

71
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,540
people could push and pull from each
other and a very hippie commune fashion

72
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,070
not necessarily the central a source it
was really useful for a quick read

73
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,160
prototyping and more agile development
where he let me put this feature to you

74
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
take a look to me what you think

75
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:18,010
cool trend history of the more popular
modern SEM you see CBS in 2004 top dog

76
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:26,140
and then just declines to a slow death
and then you see right there in Green KY

77
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,560
growing up as CBS done right or I N

78
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,260
and you know it was popular in 2006 2007
and then just has been dying off the

79
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,590
commercial perforce set up a popular for
older institutions you know it never

80
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,610
really got anywhere but it really does
well you know I'll get just been

81
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,980
exploding going on and on increasing so
seems like just beyond the Bay Area gets

82
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:01,300
a pretty popular SEM out there so he
retains some fun so the problem is what

83
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,360
is yet I've never be able to find the
name of it but there are only two

84
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,750
accepted names for it

85
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:14,169
global information tractor or very happy
but if you're not happy with kids 'cause

86
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:20,479
it does break Garden City a truck load
of shit is the other one and the reason

87
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,860
I bring this up because when it breaks
it breaks hard or breaks in ways that

88
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,960
were just making stuff you have no idea
what it meant or it's not very friendly

89
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,640
today a 64 you might imagine hitler
trying to use this gets really mad when

90
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,210
it breaks for his cancer years let's see
what happens

91
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:51,560
independent counsel for the final
competition for now and in the most of

92
00:08:51,560 --> 00:10:58,889
my stuff

93
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:13,840
trying

94
00:11:13,840 --> 00:12:01,880
gmail account

95
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:12,290
breaking only imagine confidentiality or
integrity or hell even the availability

96
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:22,900
aspects of it gets pretty sad they're
supportive I get is he would be this one

97
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,600
traditional source of truth we're ok now
we can't get to that server but it said

98
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,440
you had multiple copies all over your
infrastructure so for functionality

99
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,580
development purposes that's great and
the other hand for developers is very

100
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,550
target rich environment because all the
attackers will be going after instead of

101
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,150
just XYZ and scope now the scope is
gigantic and we need to get one of them

102
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,690
who has a misconfigured server or
unpatched system rather than just sort

103
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,200
of true that goes guarded by guards and
other physical controls about this

104
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,440
nature's unit with this ring of trust
where is the world revolves around a

105
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,170
note also revolves around you and there
are people that I trust and there's

106
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,700
people that they trust and goes on and
on and on you certain with the security

107
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,940
aspects of development there is pretty
awesome quote where you've ever done any

108
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:25,520
security work and they did not involve
the concept of trust

109
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:32,080
there was a security work it was shit
but trust me it's the only way you can

110
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:40,430
do security it's the only way you can do
development now for $40 can someone tell

111
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:47,430
me who said that they had its not Steve
it's not build caves but he also said

112
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:58,920
software is like sex it's better when
it's 3-2 down afterwards so yeah Linus

113
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,790
Torvalds we see a picture of him in
front of pirated Windows seven shop and

114
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,670
shaving the beard office mug a UNIX user

115
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,090
they're seeing part is with this
shooting nature's you don't want to give

116
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,220
everybody right access to the central
repository because he says you know what

117
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,660
people are morons so you know in this
class people who are not morons no time

118
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,320
that happens is that class too small and
then it's really hard to know if a

119
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,580
person is smarter not then if you make
it to small people have problems like a

120
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,690
the personification to justice all they
you know everyone gets commit access

121
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,930
yeah but unfortunately it's a huge
psychological barrier and endless hours

122
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,550
of politics within the organization also
is an open source communities as well as

123
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,100
you typically with the traditional flu
model of your this one source of truth

124
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,960
you have all your developers and QA
engineers and others who pulled from

125
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,020
that source of truth and then they'll
push up to their death leaves our QA

126
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,240
leads and though do their own checks and
balances there and if things will go to

127
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,900
the Executive Board reading steamer
DevOps the dictators and then go ahead

128
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,850
and push on it and it's this model that
which makes it very attractive to

129
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,360
explain his you just handle someone down
at the bottom of the totem pole just

130
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,150
hope it's weeks I'm by trying to break
it

131
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,100
but there are some part is history
looking for back doors on the private

132
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,950
sector people trying to back door
software through repositories sure

133
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:41,350
there's many many instances of this but
open source or public sector very little

134
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:49,930
we see here is 2003 not the mean Linux
repositories but a CBS reported that

135
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:56,970
setup for CBS lovers had a very
interesting change list it doesn't look

136
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:04,730
too benign but in a very cool or Linux
kernel week function do some flags if so

137
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:12,950
you know give them root privileges right
that's a very sketchy and when people

138
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,180
start to look at the history for this
there are no comments about the commit

139
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,340
to her only one that was similarly
general but still not with booths I

140
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,880
worked on the wrong file fixed it so
they go to that person called David why

141
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,600
the hell did you do this program has the
right fights piled into their program

142
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:42,340
they run as root just quite useful if
you getting local access but David M

143
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,790
swears up and down that it wasn't him so
please people step forward then got

144
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:54,390
Slashdot it out of hell and back and
then it got pretty bad but there's a

145
00:16:54,390 --> 00:17:00,780
pretty to look more into now there's
really not that many or they have been

146
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:06,650
attacking repositories but not the
technology so but the implementations or

147
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:14,209
update software for my fear ones that I
love is getting up those pretty funny

148
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,709
cuz the researcher found this default
behavior drills where hey I could start

149
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,320
changing attributes in settings for any
rails that that's running with this

150
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,550
default setting

151
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:32,520
and I can manipulating parents do what I
want and the rails community was like

152
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,130
it's a default setting people can turn
it off and then he turned it back ok

153
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,620
sure but didn't scrape TV and other
popular you know Wales Rails apps and

154
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,950
they're like me so I security
researchers typically do not have the

155
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,780
best social skills and problem-solving
so he went straight to get home to the

156
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:59,650
rails repo and just said look at this
really I can't commit a master and all

157
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,810
he did was fined one of the keys for
those who had committed or push access

158
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:12,700
to get hugs reels repo just put his own
in their coffee when they're seeing part

159
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:20,060
is just can't sit back for a minute and
think of fun story time where my manager

160
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:26,820
comes up to me and says he John how are
you doing and I'm like ok did you finish

161
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:34,940
your TPS reports that a good because we
introduce a buffer overflow very pleased

162
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:41,880
into our source code in like and what do
you mean so we put my repository and

163
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,560
change less than straightforward simple
as can be

164
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,570
buffer overflow introduced into our repo
ok when I look the repository you know

165
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,700
yes that's me touching it I'm touching
it and so he Steve Jobs czar Steven

166
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,090
apple.com did something like he's dead
there's no way he did it and then we

167
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:17,040
look further along we to 15 2015 2008
2015 like no it's almost like this

168
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,980
report was time traveling

169
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,130
made absolutely no sense I swear wasn't
me but since it wasn't doing some

170
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:31,900
features as a result there's no way to
prove that it wasn't me so maybe was my

171
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,559
friends maybe it was my peers or
co-workers quite pissed off in a code

172
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,610
review or maybe with some evil hackers
wearing a ski mask you know taking my

173
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,540
computer looking at the retired worker
so I say hey security Come on Over come

174
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,460
take a look and the whole thing
distributed model kit is there gonna

175
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:59,450
merely asked me who do you trust like
well I don't trust anyone in God We

176
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:06,309
Trust all others must text of when I
certificate or a cell cert considers

177
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:11,600
them part about it is they solved

178
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:20,970
integrity issue by saying hey let's use
the GPG trust model where we can

179
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,870
inherently trust other people's
signatures and how they sign in

180
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,900
declare statements when they push her
commit and I can spend a whole hour

181
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,630
talking about this model but this way we
all have neighbors so we trust so we

182
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:42,320
would never trust and we also have acces
who no one would ever trust in our

183
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,320
circle trust so its very nature there
some people you can trust fully some you

184
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,000
can be trusted to certain operations so
get very ugly you start exploring this

185
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,770
out to say 200 development man shop it's
quite interesting is the sad part about

186
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:07,429
it or the good part about it is you will
get one signature per commit there's no

187
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:11,900
multiple people be able to make the same
statement only one person so you are

188
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,310
loaded to the team and sure put your
cheat codes on and everything

189
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:23,580
you are that link for better and worse
you can embed the signatures such as we

190
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,840
see Jay Knuth doing here with a fumble
t-shirt whatnot but the typical

191
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,840
signature styles when you commit and say
hey i authorized this or I'm stating

192
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,830
this it's my own identity as you have
three point five methods of doing this

193
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,400
you can sign each and every commit which
is pretty nice until you certainly are

194
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,060
getting backlog with hundreds of commits
you need to review and sign so sure sign

195
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,660
each everyone and then you get to say
yes I reviewed each and every one of

196
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,110
these and I know take the blame

197
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,610
case anything goes wrong but apart it's
really a house or you could just quickly

198
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:10,480
sign that merge with big death and all
the history behind it he just saying

199
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,220
that saying I don't know what all this
other stuff is but I agree to no bullet

200
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:21,340
in its quick certainly but sadly you're
not really doing anything or you could

201
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,980
just glad in it to one huge patcher
defile but then again you'll miss

202
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,650
history and people come back to blame
you why did you introduce this defect or

203
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,130
bugger back door wasn't me and they look
at the history and there's no history

204
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,640
there it was you and the fun part is
this a 2.5 because I goodwill and

205
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,390
juniors I don't know what's up with the
repo servers Picasa going up and down so

206
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,470
you'll see Google engineers taking
pictures of their commit signature so to

207
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:58,530
speak like a ship this is me you know i
authorized it quickly take it down so

208
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,090
it's always entertaining to see that so
which one of those 31 a pic really

209
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,570
depends on the outcome that you want so
if you always want the history to be

210
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,200
written by the victors than just flatten
it

211
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,179
let it be what it is if you want to live
in the wild side just saying the merge

212
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:24,799
commit to the later on USB point fingers
or you can sign all the commits each and

213
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,419
every one but the problem with that is I
know about you but humans are kind of

214
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,919
lazy like Prince I want us to review and
sign it and I trust my co-workers and

215
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,690
others so just create some signing
automation very simple you know to three

216
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:44,929
lines about she'll just sign each and
every one so that kid troublesome in its

217
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:49,799
own way where the controlling just kind
of failed another hand yes the one to

218
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,250
blame but there are some parties you
happy kind of careful about when you

219
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:00,190
sign i mean are you saying that this
ladies beautiful or that there's an old

220
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:09,070
ugly which they're so you say hey I'm
committing this and it's described as

221
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,789
the meta data and everything there are
you saying the snapshot and commit

222
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:19,570
messages were offered as described in
this piece and everything else also said

223
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:26,909
in there as well or are you saying the
diff and commit message was authored as

224
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:32,789
described for instance what we see here
is so modifying the sewers and they're

225
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:38,710
giving evil hacker password the pseudo
to everything and the comment is it's ok

226
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,899
security sets oh ok sure you know that
sounds good see it be very careful with

227
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:51,200
what you mean and really need to figure
that out so there is in part is when I

228
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,710
personally like to break into stuff
especially for development purposes I

229
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,450
love it when developers just walk away
and leave their computer unlocked

230
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,450
typically what I do is I change the
background to Nicolas Cage change all of

231
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,960
their icons to kto to cage them

232
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,520
whereas in fun little lovely thinking of
you emails you know like a thinking of

233
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,270
you and then we reply back oh really
tell me what made you think that's what

234
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:22,100
I like let's don't talk you know it's
empower you and help you out but

235
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,350
typically the developers I D E

236
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:31,170
are set up to automatically push and
pull very rarely especially once they

237
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,890
get going well they have to entering
credentials they perforce environment

238
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:42,250
variables username password right there
for the taking or in a file or same

239
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,510
thing with get typically uses SSH off or
variations I think or token so if you

240
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,960
just open up their IDE no crucial back
door push him it done

241
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,820
typically when I push much more buttons
in that interesting record this script

242
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,680
kiddie hacks but get when you configure
your get environment and a few settings

243
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,320
you can set such as my email address to
my name you don't have to verify any of

244
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,900
that she gets a one-minute hi president
of the united states away house tacos

245
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,650
and here's my email address and then
make it commits and it looks like it

246
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,740
came from that person and then we're
free commit the next time you change it

247
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,160
to someone else like literally can do it
over and over again another sad thing is

248
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,990
if you really want to be script kiddie
evil you can also change the system

249
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,100
clock time you know they're right corner
click time no set it to whatever you

250
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,880
want it to look like someone was doing
in case they're on vacation the time

251
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,750
just put in their email address and name
and commit and then later on they can't

252
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,690
argue with the source the truth is there
but when we can kind of do this is

253
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,690
signing those commits but not everyone
will do that

254
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,590
and their SIM card is during the hacking
team week they're discussing how to back

255
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,140
door repose and they kinda got some
things wrong you mean they weren't far

256
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,820
off but they were really focused on
breaking shot one no reason perhaps

257
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,750
someone is when you make it to where you
say here's my code I author this

258
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,430
everything's fine

259
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:29,690
push there's a tag or its cold commit
message and that is effectively shot one

260
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,980
hash know the nice part about get by
design is that it's tamper evident

261
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,380
around in the history

262
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,070
everything phone down to current time
will be tamper evident all those hashes

263
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:48,610
will change and it will be very obvious
what happened win so the sad part is you

264
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,680
want try breaking that hash this
realistically that a higher probability

265
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,830
exists that every member of your
programming team will be attacked and

266
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:03,590
killed by wolves unrelated incidents on
that same night so if you have a really

267
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:10,030
tight tin foil hat you take your
development team is a rifle shooting

268
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:17,030
shotgun shooting but the sad part is you
look at the shopping about $75,000 and

269
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:25,070
easy to get a Shaw one collision domain
jude's very rudimentary

270
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,960
Nicole accused of straying to look upon
the collision porno their tweak it some

271
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:37,190
but most people are saying 2018 is
expected and of life for sho 100 many

272
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,940
others are saying 2016 now because I was
getting much cheaper and much quicker

273
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,760
but the good part about get

274
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,430
end up finding that collision as we see
here in these streams is your original

275
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,170
you know commit that's all good and
hunky dory is red and when this new

276
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,740
gibberish blue stream comes in the
collision it would be like yeah I don't

277
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,240
care about this new thing I'm still
going to track the old things so yeah

278
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,140
but you know if you're still have that
really take tin foil hat you see

279
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,690
something comes in and it looks like
gibberish and apply it it's going to

280
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:23,540
look like gibberish hacksaw be something
very not English your coat like but the

281
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,540
good part is imagine trying to memorize
that show one hash and try to talk to

282
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,700
your development team appears about it
like no one will ever be like hey what

283
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,440
do you think about one GB zero a 39
bubble blob so you know they stopped it

284
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,830
to a doctor prefixes especially popular
tools so imagine here you know I have to

285
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,860
make it hopefully better as we see here
gives the prefixes not the full house

286
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,220
right thing so people start talking
shorthand are referencing those while

287
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,960
Brad Fitzpatrick of life journal thing
say hey guys heres ago script where you

288
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,280
can take a repository and he commits
that you want to tamper evident to go

289
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,220
too far back and just modify the prefix
to one of your setting just what you

290
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,680
want the prefix to be a modified and
chokes through the 23 year old MacBook

291
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,200
Air

292
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,060
you know nothing too special to take
depending say five or six characters

293
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,340
long prefix 20 seconds I mean we're
talking days or millions of dollars it's

294
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,530
actually really short so sweet

295
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:35,090
this is my favorite way to start much
around with developers this bill aka

296
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:42,270
you mean my prefix o mine owner yours so
it's kind of fun but the sad part is we

297
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:48,940
start looking at signing projects in the
open source world saying get everything

298
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:56,730
the most popular projects that you post
publicly they have over 9000 stars which

299
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:03,170
have like Facebook Likes or up votes on
Reddit and others and it's kinda sad

300
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:14,970
when you think about it is what we see
here is Linux with you know 500 23,000

301
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:24,460
commits ok sure but it has roughly a
thousand and some-odd signed Mets but

302
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:32,310
you would think they get you thrown dog
food turnout really sign in at all

303
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:40,720
made be a hundred sign commits out of
the total 51,000 commits to the

304
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,430
repository very very few projects
russians signing their commits indicate

305
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:56,280
over whether it's hard you'll see is
many of the keys for the Linux commits

306
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,980
are in all of your public you know he
repository c/o MIT the PGP keys and

307
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,730
others very few other projects he will
be publicly available to really identify

308
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:13,430
who they are who they say they are but
one thing that can help reduce long is

309
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:20,810
I'm not telling you guys but the scale
appears logarithmic so if I do turn to a

310
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:33,010
much more linear format I mean yes so
yeah I get my member dr. and then rails

311
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,460
and not good state

312
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,559
so I don't know exactly why people are
signing but as you know evil attacker I

313
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,710
like that allows me to easily
impersonate people so having to break

314
00:32:45,710 --> 00:33:04,080
others security models so this is a
security conference let's talk about 200

315
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,440
days and vulnerabilities so they're not
very scientific research of hey I'm just

316
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,020
going to search for popular SEM and just
see how many known vulnerabilities there

317
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:28,710
are so you know hey Secunia a perforce
seven total UK as I watched most of the

318
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:35,860
third party tools which might expect a
la marque y told KCBS a lot of stuff and

319
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,520
third-party tools ensure their youthful
few more problems but nothing too bad

320
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:48,190
for c-kit 2008 interesting part about it
is a lot of them are actually get itself

321
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,649
not third-party software services

322
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:55,549
the first one here the case insensitive
file system kinda makes me laugh because

323
00:33:55,549 --> 00:34:02,539
Curiel another popular distributed
system had this nasa vulnerability where

324
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:08,940
case-insensitive filesystems it would
not work as expected or unexpected

325
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,050
behavior so he looked at gettin others
like a get your vulnerable to you know a

326
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:20,760
competitor be like 89 and on and on but
also try to help you out too so it's

327
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,060
quite entertaining but when they ran CBS
and ESPN three static source code

328
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:30,760
analysis to all snow fortifying others
they came out perfectly clean it was

329
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,179
intriguing definitely not expected but
it had some pretty nasty problems we're

330
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,070
talking sixty seventy resource leaks

331
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,960
memory leaks things like that but good
or bad part is typically doesn't run for

332
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,050
that long so maybe shirt and our service
but warned that is all the normal

333
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,640
pointers

334
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,850
manager overflows there's far too many
in there as you can imagine I want to

335
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,690
continue to use get not have to patch it
across my farms so I can give you those

336
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,580
but let's take a look

337
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:08,880
get lab attention problems in the past
it's really chilly new PC software built

338
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,290
on rails and a lot of the
vulnerabilities in get lab is hey I'm

339
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,250
gonna inherently trust this
configuration setting or this

340
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,880
environment variable and just execute it

341
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,820
no sanity checking nothing ok that's not
really useful links I'm able to modify

342
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,620
that aspect produce a lot more he's the
so here's the good ol give me any file

343
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,340
in the file system so proud that we key
part of it

344
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:44,010
sex params idea inversion I D does the
file exists ok send it along they still

345
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:49,340
get the patch this quite sadly but on
the other hand this is almost we too

346
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,210
easy to find but I guess a lot of people
aren't looking so they are saying about

347
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,910
the street of nature is there's tons of
ways you can pull it controls within get

348
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,480
you can write scripts and automation
server-side and client-side I strongly

349
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,810
recommend doing the little bit of sanity
checking more function on the client

350
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,890
side but don't trust it do everything
client sites so as they start to push

351
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,980
but some stuff in there and just do some
sanity checking making sure that they

352
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,220
are who they say they are and the entire
history was going down there and I have

353
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,460
a few scripts there hope you guys can
kick that off and adapted to process

354
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,010
these or to link

355
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:36,690
but ultimately you can't just
accidentally introduced back doors and

356
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,620
Europe it's always the tried-and-true
way still easiest you know river bats

357
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:50,480
pain someone off but also that just wait
for them to leave their computer or to

358
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,370
grow their machine and then just pop it
in there or if you get access to a

359
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,910
central repository start alias seen
commands or hooks when they think

360
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,110
they're doing something there she doing
something quite house and there's

361
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:09,600
definitely some ways you can adapt to
this within the suffered a moment

362
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:17,020
lifecycle more in the pre release
distribution phase so that's actually

363
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,360
quite useful but on the other hand
you're still limited by your typical

364
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,950
control zip code reviews I don't think
that sort so please fill keep your other

365
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:32,020
SCLC controls that place but on the
other hand as an attacker its awesome is

366
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,350
very few people are signing these days
so you just go in there to machine

367
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:42,780
script kiddie it and I'll probably get
through for better and worse so thank

368
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:53,650
you guys for coming to more things so
magical be a rockstar programmer or you

369
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:59,450
know awesome Stanford professor there's
this awesome Python module called rock

370
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:05,660
star just say hey gonna put this
Rockstar module give it a number of days

371
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,120
that you wanna be a rock star and say
make me a rockstar it will modify your

372
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:16,950
repository by giving you that many days
of commit logs cool right so you know I

373
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,140
said to myself fifty years worth

374
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:26,990
commit history predate any modern
computer hence they start getting fun

375
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:32,260
inquiries from recruiters say wow that's
really awesome do I can work for us how

376
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,890
do you keep busy all the time I'm like
wow you didn't actually look as what

377
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:42,340
this module does is just as hello world
as removes it day in and day out so I

378
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,390
was like ok things what made you think
of me know but the other thing with get

379
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,830
home as they have this awesome API

380
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:56,080
a fire hose all the public commits and
you know Ben Cox took a look at this and

381
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,840
started pulling all the SSH keys of
people were using to authenticate into

382
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,940
and pushing and pulling and collected a
large database and then started going

383
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,619
over that will you might imagine with a
sage

384
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:17,240
your keys by default now we're 1024
maybe for a little paranoid 2048 or 4096

385
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:25,460
he's finding keys 20 256 very weak he is
and he's like hey guys these are easy to

386
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,730
reverse and get how do you really
understand the shared responsibility

387
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,820
aspects of the service and they're like
you know their keys they generate them

388
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,700
their fault he's like no really this is
a problem you need to tell them we're

389
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,310
starting corrective action and they're
looking so he put it out there in the

390
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:48,630
public domain hey guys look what I found
here the entire data set and then

391
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,490
immediately get hopes like ok

392
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:57,840
revoking all those keys so interesting
time so sometimes you have to go in

393
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,530
through the front door on the other hand
when the last bit of laughter and you

394
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,779
guys off

395
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:15,650
tweets meanest horrible angry
programmers are angry people you know

396
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:22,669
some of the people I work with you to be
angry to Ryan block tweets Minister vote

397
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:24,229
since crowning achievement

398
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:30,609
forget debate why do you have to have
just one crowning achievement I can do

399
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:36,159
both my tweets a friendly Linux dual
booting exists because Lina strongholds

400
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:45,790
wanted to play Prince of Persia das not
anymore we've got steam

401
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:51,630
so I can't recommend more than 40 get
booked a great resource out how to

402
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:56,370
function we use get but how to lock it
down it thanks to be aware of

403
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:03,190
so thank you guys for coming and i truly
had any questions you find me over in

404
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,750
the vendor area the corner over there
and thank you guys so I'll see you later
