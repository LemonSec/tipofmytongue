1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
Polski I'm a research scientist at urs
army tank automotive research

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,179
development and engineering center in
Warren Michigan also known as star tech

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:15,080
and this is actually my first jerk on so
far really like this conference all I

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,600
have to say it's not a lot of great
people here and I really have to kind of

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,359
give it up to Jamie and Chris they
really really generous

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,970
this community and just want to publicly
give them credit for allowing me to talk

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:38,050
today basically at Artech I work in the
ground vehicle robotics group and i do

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,030
research in computational trust so
essentially what I try to do as I try to

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,270
teach robots how to trust other robots
or people in group teaming scenarios and

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,149
then and then using that trust to affect
the control their behavior so they can

11
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,500
do smart stuff to complete missions and
my application focus has been autonomous

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,330
convoy operations it's really cool
research problem because it's somewhat

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,580
constrained and all defined but it's
also really relevant for the military

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,369
for the army into secular because
because that's right when during convoy

15
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:22,290
operations over in theater basically the
number one killer of arson of our

16
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,259
warfighters is IEDs improvised explosive
devices or roadside bombs and those

17
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,680
typically blow up during combat missions
so the idea of building vehicles that

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,750
can drive themselves so anybody and
statistically speaking you know you

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:48,009
reduce number of people you need to do
combat missions he'll probably reduce

20
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,210
the casualty rates thereby saving lives
so

21
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,840
but you know the whole thing is when you
start putting technology into vehicles

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,340
that allow them to drive themselves are
also introducing new vulnerabilities so

23
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,800
about a year or so ago I got introduced
to the wonderful world of car hacking at

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:17,319
an event in in Troy Michigan suburb of
Detroit and basically i got really

25
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,319
excited about it subscribe day event
that excited about it I want to go back

26
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,560
to turn back afterwards and do this kind
of stuff on our military systems and I

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,269
was trying to find a group that article
did this kind of stuff and it turned out

28
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,530
that we don't have anybody yet hard it
was for her bility assessments I'm

29
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,600
military vehicles that's not to say that
the army doesn't have anybody I mean

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,320
army has a lot of qualified people doing
this kind of stuff elsewhere but for

31
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,019
target being in our R&D organization you
would think that there would be somebody

32
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:54,920
there but turns out there wasn't that
surprised me but it also kind of I'm

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,720
kinda looked at it as an opportunity for
myself I said hey maybe I could be the

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,540
guy to fill this gap so I start talking
with some colleagues of mine that for

35
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,329
like minded and research meeting kind of
ad hoc talking about this subject

36
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:17,660
eventually these meetings got more
regular regular and and and then more

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,120
people surveyed becoming an invited to
these meetings and then over time we

38
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,630
came to the conclusion that you know as
a group we really couldn't effect as

39
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,350
much change we had to open up our group
wider and try to develop a community so

40
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,109
so we decided to open up to other people
that are back and we had a really

41
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,230
positive response we had people from all
over their organization technical groups

42
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,330
and non-technical groups like RHR and

43
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,560
external business office for example
they were connecting with all of us and

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,480
talking to all of us they can kind of
say now but a year later we actually

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,740
have a nice vehicle cybersecurity
collaborative community at Artech that's

46
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,290
something that's never we never had
before so that that's really positive

47
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,920
but when we opened up this whole group
to others there are some challenges

48
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,390
because we had some culture clashes now
is something that I don't really

49
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:23,740
anticipate when it happened I just stop
people being assholes but really what

50
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,230
happened to Isis they actually saw
things differently than other people

51
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,510
from other places and didn't quite get a
good appreciation for that until you

52
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,950
start talking with them and getting to
know them so that's kind of what this

53
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,140
does sort of inspiration for this talk
I'm not really going to talk about our

54
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,230
deck specific to you anymore

55
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,090
the stock has more about the military
consumer culture in general and I just

56
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,750
wanna talk about it tonight and
hopefully give a better understanding of

57
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,640
this type of culture to this community

58
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,510
talk about how struggles within the
cyber domain and maybe what are some

59
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:12,000
ideas and learn from the hacker culture
to improve its own culture so let's

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,550
start off with just a definition of
culture is if you look on the internet

61
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,770
you'll probably find about three dozen
different definitions for culture I

62
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,550
found this one that probably works well
enough for our purposes it's from a guy

63
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:32,220
named Edgar Schein is a former MIT
professor who's famous for his work in

64
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,430
development or organizational
development and he defines culture as a

65
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,919
pattern of shared basic assumptions that
the group has learned groupware and as

66
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,050
it solve problems of external adaptation
internal integration has worked well

67
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,460
enough to be considered valid and
therefore it

68
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,419
to be taught to new members as the
correct way to proceed thinking feeling

69
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:59,449
relations those problems so the ideas
are pattern a basic share basic

70
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,880
assumptions that are good enough and
considered to be the correct way to

71
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,449
proceed think and feel so when you apply
this definition to military culture

72
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:16,979
certain characteristics emerged uniform
any security realistic and military

73
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,009
culture that idea that really nobody
special everybody is kind of the same

74
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:28,289
interchangeable it's also speaks to
aspects of the bond between military

75
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:32,610
members whether you're fighting on the
front lines are supporting the logistics

76
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,410
tail or or or fighters here all veterans
are all heroes that kind of a kind of

77
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:45,389
idea gets embodying uniformity
characteristic hard work this is

78
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:52,650
basically in begins being rain when a
recruit goes to basic training you know

79
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,220
it doesn't matter if you're given a task
that's considered to be impossible but

80
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,979
culture expects you to do whatever you
can do to complete that task matter how

81
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:07,810
hard it is teamwork really important
particularly for coordinated operations

82
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,300
you have to be able to rely on other
people and other people to be able to be

83
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,560
able to rise rely on you so a culture
that he supports that stoicism idea that

84
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,190
this matter how much pain you're in this
matter how much stuff

85
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,240
hurt so much you're hurting so much you
don't like something to keep it to

86
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,090
yourself you don't really tell anybody
that has problems with it when you're

87
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:37,620
considering things like PTSD but it's
still kind of aspects of the culture

88
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,570
that has sort of evolved over time

89
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:46,470
orderliness gotta find obviously you
gotta have you know that the military

90
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:52,160
has a very rigid rules regulations
processes things have to be on schedule

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,310
timely orderliness is a really big part
of the culture and also trusted

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,320
authority and somebody above you

93
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,760
ranking above you give your command
order to do you have to follow it is

94
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,350
just expected so this culture evolved
basically because of the types of

95
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,740
operations that the military will be
involved in different physical domains

96
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:22,510
when Darren C and this chart kind of is
supposed to be picked all the different

97
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:32,390
kinds of physical domains of warfare
along the axis of the level of

98
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,260
technology involved in this

99
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,030
the difference spectrum of conflict so
traditionally what you find is that the

100
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:44,099
United States has generally dominated in
the center part of this spectrum

101
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,410
traditional modern warfare in remote or
share so what that's caused our

102
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,040
adversaries to do is kind of move
towards the poles of risk spectrum so

103
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,160
you'll see you know our adversaries
either going for asymmetrical warfare 3

104
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,370
insurgencies or developing nuclear
weapons

105
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,779
and you know the the whole thing the
whole common thread behind the spectrum

106
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,610
of conflict is that the cyber domain
cuts across all of it doesn't matter

107
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,960
what they're doing dealing with low-tech
high-tech the cyber domain exist and the

108
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,120
military culture that has a sort of
evolved to deal with the physical

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,680
domains hasn't really changed enough to
consider

110
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,640
to exchange enough to be a successful
within the cyber domain the cyber domain

111
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,029
is a completely different beast and then
the physical demands of air ground and

112
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:50,230
sea traditionally you know the military
has been basically dealing dealing on

113
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,730
the assumption that nation states only
attack other nation states very well

114
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,010
defined boundaries of who you are
attacking where they are like dancing in

115
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,320
our existing paradigm particularly in
the cyber domain tax and spending can

116
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,250
occur between any combination of states
state proxies non-state actors and

117
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,589
commercial companies and sometimes you
don't even know whether these attacks

118
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:22,529
are offensive or defensive the barriers
are low cheap somewhat easy pretty

119
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,580
prepared and can be pretty powerful you
can potentially have a global impact

120
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,820
where's the rest of the different kinds
of cyberattacks that can happen in

121
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,380
military contacts so that's kind of what
existing paradigm looks like what about

122
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,100
where things are going the way I kind of
like to look at where things are going

123
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,100
to look at it in terms of four vectors
moving in the same direction but at

124
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,950
different speeds you've got technology

125
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,480
that's moving the fastest and right
behind technology get the social norms

126
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:06,740
and then there's a big gap in speed
between law and policy formation you

127
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:14,320
know and when you look at these four
factors what can we extract trends to

128
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,300
extract from these factors only when you
look at the fastest too intense EE that

129
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,130
were in general training trading privacy
for convenience and this has been a

130
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,470
trend that has existed ever since the
invention of the Telegraph and it's this

131
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,190
isn't anything new and we can can can
you see this kind of thing to persist

132
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:42,410
and then slower side you tend to be
seeing this intention of trading privacy

133
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:49,900
for security now that's obviously kind
of a controversial topic area and and

134
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,270
could probably be a talk of its own and
it really enjoyed hearing a lawyer talk

135
00:11:54,270 --> 00:12:01,080
about this kind of stuff but when you
look at legislation like sis sis and you

136
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,250
know where they're going to be trying to
basically allowing private companies

137
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,630
share information with the government
have liability and even looking at

138
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:18,540
existing laws even like the CIA and DMCA
some reforms to those for white actors

139
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,310
too

140
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,740
you know be protected from hacking into
different systems in that shopping go to

141
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,650
jail

142
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,740
you know you can't

143
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:37,180
to seek out of it trend for trading
privacy for security but the main point

144
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,740
that I wanted everybody to get out of
the site is that three of these four

145
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:49,490
factors are related to people to humans
and particularly human behavior and as a

146
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,980
result can be a case can be made that
the management of the different cyber

147
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,530
challenges that will be facing are
largely cultural not necessarily

148
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:10,270
technical so kind of bring it down from
sort of a fifty thousand high if you've

149
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:16,850
done tomorrow in organizational level of
benefits which he see former Sabre Sabre

150
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,970
culture and organization in general what
you'll see is better behaviour in

151
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,490
general less risky behaviors may be more
compliance with high policies decrease

152
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,430
resistance to changes but you know
they're probably put themselves out

153
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,140
there that are looking at this and
saying well you know better

154
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:42,340
will never be perfect so it's only takes
12 to compromise a system why bother why

155
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,050
should we even bother dealing with the
culture I think are you get men can be

156
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,100
made that better culture will probably
probably reduce the ease of exploiting

157
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,070
vulnerabilities can get rid of him but
it probably reduce the ease of it you

158
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,850
might also have fewer network anomalies
so maybe you can have better detection

159
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,890
when you're looking for intrusions and
if you're implement sorry folks video

160
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:14,040
clips here but audio is doomed shortly

161
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,130
that's a tough thing to deal with its
really difficult thing to deal with and

162
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,920
some of the problems that has caused
this

163
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,040
for example it's caused us to have not
dated procurement system our networks

164
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,810
are not viewed as war-fighting platform
space they stumbled onto the network

165
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,600
they call it a night he got to build the
network but I T guy doesn't really have

166
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,509
concept of how it's going to be using an
operational context so the acquisition

167
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:47,639
of the networks and the operations of
the networks don't hurt when you know so

168
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,649
so that can that that's a problem so
what that results in is that you end up

169
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,509
with little situation awareness of
what's going on in networks with her

170
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:02,949
using them in an operational context you
don't typically no one wanted intrusions

171
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:08,509
are until after they happened and the
soldiers using these networks really can

172
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:15,290
insist he would adversaries might do and
it's a lot different than what they're

173
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,010
used to like they were on they had boots
on the ground and they were looking

174
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,930
around and physical environment they can
say hey I see moms over there I see

175
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,420
trees over there there's a carryover
sure that the enemy may be able to come

176
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,750
inside better setup differences over
there they can't do that kind of

177
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:40,310
analogous thing within their networks
and that's a real issues sometimes both

178
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,130
but even if there was some way where we
could

179
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,570
fix the procurement system in a much
better situation awareness something

180
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,930
that works you still run into another
issue about sharing between different

181
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,880
branches in many cases the from branches
have a kid share because of clearance

182
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:07,570
issues if somebody discovers a threat
its classified as top secret they can't

183
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,410
know they can't necessarily easily tell
somebody over lower classification about

184
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:26,990
that threat it's the rules can do it so
now the only problem is these are new

185
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,060
problems it's not as if the Department
of those who doesn't know about them and

186
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,520
there are lots of people working on
resolving these issues but question I

187
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,760
want to ask is what is the military
doing with regards to addressing the

188
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:50,800
cultural stuff so one of the big things
I heard about at the Sheraton si

189
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,580
conference as cyber hygiene said he
heard about this stuff it's basically

190
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,990
it's a lot of us probably considered as
common sense but the military's

191
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:08,280
corroding it in terms of you know people
having good passwords and clicking you

192
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,150
know

193
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,770
links in your email now putting devices
into your computers so on a common sense

194
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,760
stuff but you know just like the
military sometimes they take it a little

195
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,270
bit too far and you know for example a
password policy just last week I was

196
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:29,330
connecting to a military government
website and I had asked me to create a

197
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,760
password is 15 characters long to
capital letters to lower case letters to

198
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,870
two numbers to special characters it's
kinda did you know it sounds secure you

199
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,620
know because you're adding all this
random stuff in it but really you know

200
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,380
right from you have to access this site
I magnin remembers such a long pass word

201
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,900
I'm probably gonna have to write it down
somewhere in this kind of defeating the

202
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,940
whole purpose of butter password so you
know the cyber hygiene thing for all

203
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,640
it's a really good idea probably so
spread across entire military sometimes

204
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,370
implementation of it the policies that
come out of that aren't always the best

205
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:18,390
in another thing you know we can look
into his actual DOD cyber strategy which

206
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,710
was updated in April this year and it's
it's not very long document but she can

207
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,540
scan through it there there really isn't
a whole lot in there about affecting the

208
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,340
culture but there are a couple things
that we can kind of point out firstly

209
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,830
you know the big thing I noticed was
integrating cyber and submission

210
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,570
insurance assessments and mission
assurance it's all about full life cycle

211
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,750
engineering processes that are designed
to deal with deficiencies and mission

212
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:55,880
success and in the past the cyber domain
was never integrated into these mission

213
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,880
insurance assessments this is going
toward this is going to be different and

214
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,470
because the mission always comes first I
think this is going to have a really big

215
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,380
impact culturally entire military

216
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,220
the other thing that they talked about
in the strategy is mitigating the risk

217
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,060
of insider threats now they talk about
it in terms of intrusion detection

218
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,950
systems and more technical stuff but now
they have this little footnote talking

219
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,070
about a requirement for cultural
awareness and this is really the only

220
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:39,340
time the DoD cyber strategy mentions
culture specifically so you know I i'm i

221
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,060
imagine the strategies gonna get updated
in the future I would hope maybe in the

222
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,940
future

223
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,450
they're considered more of the cultural
aspects when designing their strategy in

224
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:57,530
the future the thing that I asked his
can we do better and is there a way is

225
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,310
there anything that we can learn from
the hacker culture and be able to adopt

226
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:09,290
into the military culture so just kind
of doing a side-by-side comparison

227
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,050
between how culture in military culture
and i'm looking at hacker culture more

228
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,710
broadly than just computer hacker

229
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,990
you know we can see that military
culture values uniformity you hackers

230
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:28,380
cultures about uniqueness individualism
Walter culture hard work a culture it's

231
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:35,500
more about I think playfulness military
cultures about team work cultures about

232
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:44,309
a little softer more cooperative more
collaborative stoicism paramilitary

233
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:49,070
culture keeping things in holding things
in not sure it not sharing what you

234
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,149
really think I think hacker culture
tends to be more about sharing and being

235
00:20:53,149 --> 00:21:02,620
more open military culture being very
orderly reoriented

236
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:09,260
cultures more about created this going
in any direction no bounds and finally

237
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:15,850
trusted authority it's completely
opposite in a hacker culture it's

238
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,120
generally a distrust of authority so on
the surface it kinda looks like these

239
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,110
two cultures are incompatible with each
other maybe they are that's not to say

240
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,000
that the military doesn't adapt elements
from the hacker culture in for specific

241
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,620
functions SEDAR public when they relate
to the cyber Grand challenger working on

242
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,980
formal methods research through the hack
of this program or that even the NSA you

243
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,299
know doing information information
intelligence intelligence work you know

244
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:52,190
they'll adapt things from agriculture in
those specific functions and in the same

245
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,659
thing that hackers will adapt things
from military culture if they want to do

246
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:03,220
things on an incredible large-scale
weather with people or botnets actually

247
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,399
if you look at the botnet from a
cultural perspective it kind of ticks

248
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:13,860
all the boxes on the military culture
side but the question I want to ask is

249
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,760
are there any even despite these
incompatibilities are there is there

250
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,950
anything that we can do are there any
ideas that we can adopt from the hacker

251
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:30,640
culture into the military culture more
holistic Lee I think there are I think

252
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,240
what I do we can adapt into the military
is being more serious reading culture

253
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,240
it's ok to ask more questions

254
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,090
creating a culture where people are
encouraged to actively listen not just

255
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,500
listen ok what is the task I have to do
and try to listen actually with

256
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,540
understanding in a culture where people
notice one or more aware of what others

257
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:03,030
are doing around them I think being more
serious is something that hackers it's

258
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,970
just something so something naturally
that they do I don't think this is

259
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,570
necessarily something that's naturally
ingrained within the military culture

260
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,960
and then speaking up

261
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,309
agriculture they don't care people don't
care if they offend somebody to

262
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:22,230
criticize someone and I thought I would
probably argue that a lot of military

263
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:29,100
folks probably don't care either this is
probably more of a boy for the civilian

264
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,040
side but but they also don't worry about
appearing weak or too sensitive heart of

265
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,120
lined really I think within the Hawker
culture the focus is about the greater

266
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,940
good at making the greater good a
priority and I think having policies

267
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,230
were military folks are encouraged to
speak up something that would be really

268
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:01,679
important to deal with issues within the
cyber domain and then finally making

269
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,680
things more fun maybe through game of
gamification

270
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,990
essentially like in any game you have to
have good incentives accountability and

271
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,740
enforcement in general the military has
said those kind of things ingrained in

272
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:22,310
this culture obviously though it's you
have to apply in context of what you're

273
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,430
doing so in my case in R&D organization
we can maybe try to make things more fun

274
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:34,500
by painting developers and engineers
against Penn testers and having sort of

275
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,880
an internal kind of competition who can
do better that's something that that's a

276
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,890
kind of a part of a culture that you can
introduce thats posit that will have a

277
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:54,419
positive effect on cybersecurity so
given this was only up to

278
00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:00,879
this is pretty much free last slide just
a couple final thoughts I hope is that

279
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:05,230
you understand a little bit better why
military does what it does when it comes

280
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,919
to cyber domain and maybe hopefully for
some folks may be starting to build some

281
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:17,899
bridges in order for the military to
improve to make cybersecurity more

282
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:22,389
natural aspect of daily activities so
they need to see their cyber operatives

283
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:26,590
that's where fighters they need to treat
their military networks as war-fighting

284
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:32,379
platforms and they need to treat the
whole domain a cyber domain is something

285
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:38,999
real that's something that's actually
imaginary and in addition anyone that's

286
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:44,879
working in her for the military needs to
just considered being more open to

287
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,019
change

288
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:50,759
don't this is kind of a depressing the
hidebound culture of sticking to

289
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,779
tradition and convention when it went
with it with the Cybermen changing as

290
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:04,619
quickly as it is it's not something that
is really compatible so I would hope you

291
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,980
know this is kind of a big point is
people at all levels just be a little

292
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,879
more open minded consider the threats
consider consider what you can do to

293
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:23,840
respond to threats not just in the ways
that you always done it and that's

294
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,409
basically my talk short and sweet I'll
be around her questions if anybody wants

295
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:34,559
to have some conversations but thank you
very much
