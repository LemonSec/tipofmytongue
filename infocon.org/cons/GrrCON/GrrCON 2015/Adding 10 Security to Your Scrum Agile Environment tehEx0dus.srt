1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,889
I me on Twitter as an exodus so let's
get started a little background about

2
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:19,539
myself I started writing DBA
applications and compiling code and

3
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:25,240
middle school as I got into the college
starting to an undergraduate research

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,410
projects and security and cryptography
and risk assessment so that's kind of

5
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:38,530
when I started diving into security so
now I work as an application developer

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:47,399
and a state government have been doing
scrum agile for the past two years it's

7
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,890
kind of a brief overview of my talk kind
of give you about

8
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,840
I guess breaking down security into kind
of two major goal a handful of goals

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:05,019
giving you a 10,000 overview of what
scrum agile is in general terms this

10
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,509
will be a full data dump although I can
probably pull you out with hours with

11
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:16,750
definitions how does scrum agile benefit
developers what is the effect on

12
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,720
business operations of security teams
and development teams Campoli work

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:29,880
together to achieve their goals and
security to protect their organization

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,020
and development teams need to prove
modify and not break

15
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:44,410
functionality and they're kind of
developing things one of us and it's

16
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:51,179
scary negatives in the scrum agile
environment so why some things and

17
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:54,890
security irksome concepts of security
might not work in like the scrum agile

18
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,950
environment

19
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,530
so with our security goals on line

20
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:09,330
how to apply please describe that
insecurity and cannot talk about the

21
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,660
security and development scrum
integration so how to integrate security

22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:21,390
teams and development teams into the
scrum process also point out some

23
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,880
limitations of this some things that
might not work out too well and then

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,150
I'll talk about finally wrapping it up
with if we just focus specifically on

25
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,730
security teams how to add them to their
own specific agile process of this kind

26
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,730
of two things I highlight either
integrating security teams in

27
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:49,120
development teams or address security
teams until whole process so

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,739
highlighting to general goals of
security we have kind of prevention

29
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:59,489
training response and investigation so
prevention training we have things like

30
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,920
defining policies procedures help secure
an organization you know protecting

31
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:14,350
day-to-day operations training we have
things like continuous education telling

32
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,320
people what they shouldn't do or helping
people realize that they can do they

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,610
should do certain things

34
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,910
monitoring essential network tools to
help identify

35
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,650
outside outsourced outside intrusions
are things happening on the network that

36
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,360
might not look so good at setting up
mechanisms help them implement specific

37
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,400
policies so these are kind of things off
all that would fall under the umbrella

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,190
prevention response and investigation we
have things like responding to alarms

39
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,650
are anomalies

40
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,360
things some things don't look right so
this will be part of the investigation

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,500
process during the during the initial
research research to figure out if

42
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,290
things don't look

43
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:18,829
10,000

44
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,430
is basically using small teams to break
a large project into small manageable

45
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,580
short goals like 10 slivers of a project
using one to three weeks of time

46
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:40,659
teams can see you see the projects their
progress on a large project as a

47
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:47,750
complete tasks teams can identify areas
of improvement look at positive outcome

48
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:57,460
see things that they've done well at the
end of each sprint and some breaking

49
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:05,390
that large project into small manageable
goals

50
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:14,850
Terms of Use first one is user stories
so that when be short specific

51
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:22,550
description of a task so as X Liu y so
that see so as a user I want to be able

52
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,650
to quickly login to claim report

53
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,880
we have grooming so that's defining the
acceptance criteria the scope of the

54
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,889
project

55
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,650
setting up the user stories spread
briefly talked about that but that is

56
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,150
your one two three weeks of time for
your specific tasks or projects Scrum

57
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,240
Master that's a person that helps guide
the project handles any issues that a

58
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,449
team might have with a specific task
that might prevent them from completing

59
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:03,220
up the product owner that's a person
that owns the product little set up and

60
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:19,080
help to find acceptance criteria things
that need to happen and a specific

61
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,080
priority because depending on what
happened would be the order

62
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,530
retrospective thats a meeting at the end
of each sprint usually run by the Scrum

63
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:38,000
Master for teams to identify things that
went wrong is also a rolling along so

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,729
you kind of go back and see if this
particular issue continuing to be a

65
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:52,729
problem or how well are we doing a demo
is at the end of each strand displaying

66
00:06:52,729 --> 00:07:00,380
to people what you've completed this
meeting is he's a run by the product

67
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:11,039
owner so those are a handful of times so
what are some of the benefits of

68
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,710
developers some of the benefits with
developers and scrum agile process has a

69
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,100
lot of people are using it so I as a
sort of so popular

70
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:28,110
helps developers focus on completing one
specific on specific task

71
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,720
at a time as a sign themselves at a
store in the spring so when developer

72
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,580
picks up creating a page or fixing
something so the developer ATT you're

73
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,750
set to one specific thing at a time

74
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,380
short daily updates are given

75
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,630
well daily everyday help keep that
individuals focus on the developer ATT

76
00:07:52,630 --> 00:08:00,260
Eve that sometimes occurs you keep that
person on track with in this meeting

77
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,090
recap is given up the previous day so
this is what I worked on yesterday

78
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,660
that's what I'll be doing today

79
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,240
complete that task force will be working
on that there's any issues you know kind

80
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:22,510
of handle any issues and bring those up
so measurable expectations are given

81
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:30,010
with a predefined length of time so a
task is already laid out its gonna take

82
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:36,150
me six hours on this can take me three
hours so you only have a set time set

83
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,430
and that acceptance criteria is already
ready now ideally no perfect world but

84
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:50,820
that doesn't happen all the time so I

85
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,570
went to the retrospective look back and
you see this didn't work out too well

86
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:03,910
we're just ask was grossly over
estimated or underestimated so helps

87
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:14,770
keep the measurable expectations of what
someone should do in line and because

88
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,470
all those requirements and acceptance
criteria define when someone picks up a

89
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:36,530
given task you're not gonna have scope
of the entire project start to later on

90
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:45,220
and he's so nasty the completion of this
type of a larger project and so as you

91
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:52,020
start piling on these layers you can you
begin to focus on figuring out the

92
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,250
deadline of a specific projects so it
doesn't have a open-ended date for

93
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:05,160
completion

94
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,750
business operations of development teams
and security teams can work together to

95
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,190
achieve their goals

96
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,980
security needs to protect their
organization and development teams need

97
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,920
to prove modify current functionality
and if they don't have achieved this

98
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:29,199
this will affect business operations and
pinpoint focus on the process right now

99
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:34,470
so security is to protect their
organisations can protect the data

100
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:43,529
finances daily operations so you know
defining better policies to educate

101
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:54,629
people on this affects business and how
they perform their operations security

102
00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:01,139
is also help prevent data loss of your
data that can be out there so possibly

103
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,680
setting up disaster recovery plans some
of these are just examples building

104
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,050
better policies better mechanism so
heartening the show outside of your

105
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,949
business

106
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:26,750
also responding to incidents with them

107
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:41,279
teams when you complete a project can
move on to another project

108
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:51,529
development development time officially
more efficient use of resources better

109
00:11:51,529 --> 00:12:01,059
documentation and better more feature
complete software

110
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:09,420
this is all gonna help these are some of
the goals and just development and when

111
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,399
you have more feature complete software
that's gonna help business operations

112
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,980
better documentation is gonna help
business bill training manuals on a

113
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:28,339
specific product

114
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,949
they don't have security and development
doesn't complete their goals since

115
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:42,050
sometimes securities can be reactive you
can fully plan for certain things that

116
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:51,610
could happen when new policies are
mechanisms are created if the

117
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:58,029
educational goal isn't really there and
sometimes users will understand why

118
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:05,870
something is happening this can affect
people in the organization itself

119
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:16,990
people's daily routines because their
daily tasks have become more complex

120
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,020
thing as if they have a lack of funding
this could also affect business

121
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,220
operations because he won't be able to
build those better policies are better

122
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:36,580
security mechanisms lack of knowledge on
the security side again could also

123
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:43,850
affect business operations because he
leave those can be a danger of exposed

124
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,360
systems that you might not know about
because you're not securing the

125
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:59,080
environment and a lot of things can come
from that the development side so if

126
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:09,620
task completed on time and go back to
finding a second to play quicker so if

127
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,330
you have contractors on a specific
project helping the development team out

128
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:22,730
those funds you can lose a resource for
future projects to be pushed back to

129
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:33,800
unknown dates and I'm kind of security
teams and development teams things occur

130
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:47,310
there could be a lack of faith on those
specific individuals or groups

131
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:54,360
scrum agile so what things can be to
make it difficult to implement scrum

132
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:03,710
agile and in a given environment it
teams are limited test that number

133
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:13,060
task during a sprint planning this can
account for emergencies so of

134
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,470
emergencies come up and you have so many
tasks allocated for your time

135
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,390
those emergencies don't have acceptance
criteria or you don't know how long it's

136
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,480
going to take you to pick something to
figure out if something is actually an

137
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,510
emergency so that I'm to find an
undefined Scopus just can be a black

138
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:44,120
hole of time he's a story sometimes can
encapsulate many aspects of security so

139
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:58,070
defining a Zacks I want to why so that
she might be to find so as

140
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:09,320
stop forgetting that can really do we
define too well so given our initial

141
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:17,710
security goals of training response
investigation how to apply these

142
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:25,000
indiscriminate fire meant with
prevention training those can be fleshed

143
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,850
out and growing so kind of limiting the
scope of the specific project for a

144
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:38,750
given task so does redefining a specific
policy meet the definition of done as we

145
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:50,520
want it or does it need more to really
become a proper policy and the retro

146
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:58,980
look back and see if certain prevention
manager isn't as great as great as it

147
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,740
should be

148
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,030
training can be increased from what I
was paid lease lease at so you can look

149
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:21,809
back and see all these things if they
need to be better defined

150
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:29,419
retrospect down you can look back again
and identify things that went wrong in

151
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:34,570
figure out how to fix them how this
could possibly lead into more tasks

152
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:42,769
which I'll talk about here shortly and
then the investigation portion of our

153
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:51,730
goal should be set during the demo so

154
00:17:51,730 --> 00:18:03,799
something's wrong so in security and
development teams talked about how do

155
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,080
you fully integrate both teams into the
scrum agile process so as essentially

156
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:19,179
one team gonna bring up some possible
limitations as well for this we start to

157
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:24,799
integrate the two teams together the
security team should start by sitting in

158
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,990
a job-related meetings with a specific
development team if there are multiple

159
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:39,330
teams and I want to kind of focus on
only one team at a time or even have

160
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:46,230
kind of break up a security team a
little bit and kind of spread yourself

161
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:55,390
between two teams are multiple teams

162
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,160
security

163
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:04,440
teams continue to dive into the scrum
agile process maybe take a training

164
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,460
continuously to integrate themselves
into this entire process and actively

165
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:19,790
participate schedule trainings with
developers to help teach them and

166
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,640
explain some security concepts to
explain why something might be

167
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:34,230
beneficial if they don't understand you
can also meet with the product on the

168
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,400
Scrum Master as well have things at a
backlog that could be eventually groom

169
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,520
so as you integrate yourself into this
team itself

170
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:57,390
things can be added to the to the
background as part of a project or not

171
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,010
some security

172
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,280
might not be immediately within the
scope of the current projects that can

173
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:14,400
be a possible limitation but one way to
solve this would be to leave some idle

174
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:23,700
capacity during the Sprint allow people
to handle critical issues or issues that

175
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:30,560
need to be fixed with a specific project
but have not yet been groomed so goes

176
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:40,580
back to giving out a specific task and
building that acceptance criteria

177
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,049
limits so if there are multiple
development teams but a limited number

178
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:58,179
of security teams it might be difficult
to focus on multiple teams security team

179
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:10,470
is my spread themselves to that at some
point and the developer Michael on board

180
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,140
so

181
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,120
LeBron boarding my become an issue if
there isn't necessarily a security

182
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,280
background so you might have to start
all over what kind of growing developer

183
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:33,440
of how to write proper code how to
sanitize ramparts and things along those

184
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,030
lines

185
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,450
when you first start integrating herself
into the scrum process will have to

186
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:53,670
start all over again they could also be
a learning curve and both teams some

187
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:00,680
developers just changing how they way
how they write code that can be a little

188
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,320
rough for them they could be writing
code for years but they only know one

189
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,800
specific way so doing things a different
way might be kind of difficult for them

190
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:18,360
initially they could be learning curve
for security professionals lol just kind

191
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:26,510
of learning the scrum agile process of
changing the way they do things the

192
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:33,690
frustration just adding out of scope
project items to the backlog that are

193
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,190
not within the scope of the development
teams might be an issue so something's

194
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,500
not necessarily high priority but you
can figure out if things are broken

195
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:49,120
those things might not get fixed then
things start to pile up in the backlog

196
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:57,980
those higher critical those things that
aren't aren't higher critical to be

197
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:10,850
pushed back even further so that could
be a possible frustration

198
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:21,640
family implementing Agile into just
strictly security teams get kind of

199
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:30,620
high-level example so let's say 12
improve current paths password

200
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:40,660
authentication on an external went up so
in the beginning we might have various

201
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,350
tasks to help get this project rolling
the product owner might start breaking

202
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,990
down

203
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:53,240
current policies of the current policy
and figure out if they do we really need

204
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,370
to improve this or not start defining
this project and breaking it down into

205
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:06,740
our small slivers Itasca be determine if
there is documentation so we'll start

206
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,100
piling on tasks which are celebrities if
there's no documentation so on the

207
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,910
technical knowledge might need to sit in
the grooming session on the current help

208
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:23,210
define what the current system is ur a
task would be to figure out what the

209
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:30,600
current system as you start building and
tasked to figure out if you're if the

210
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,500
current web app is working or if it's
not so

211
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:47,670
figuring out if it really needs to be
redefined adjusted initial tasks so as

212
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,170
we start looking into this kind of
password policy we started we then start

213
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,780
building our user stories into finding
her acceptance criteria of things that

214
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:06,400
need to happen in a specific task so
this could be a research phase

215
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:14,010
each party will be broken down into your
stories most are building their building

216
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,100
our task and he's just always so some
examples of this can be as a

217
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:26,070
non-technical user how do I log in as a
user I need increased come password

218
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:32,120
complexity of the current password by
setting a minimum character like or as a

219
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,500
user you should not be able to use the
same password eight times or as an admin

220
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:45,090
and even more complex user passwords and
other users so those keeping some

221
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:52,730
examples from here age she's a story
will be

222
00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:00,620
extractor acceptance criteria to be more
specific

223
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:08,950
be finish in a given sprint we need to
figure out a way to break that down into

224
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,460
smaller tasks so breaking down even
further because we want small slivers

225
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:23,630
and so as we start to do this if there
wasn't documentation before will have

226
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:38,480
correct documentation which is a task in
itself to

227
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:48,050
that we can consider before project is
finally finish

228
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:55,920
the current password complexity really
has so we don't know kinda figured that

229
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:09,920
out as we start so once we change the
password complexity just verifying that

230
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:18,450
the state could also be a task and if
there are any issues that's another task

231
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:41,240
task that the project itself even after
the the password policy has changed then

232
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,310
you also have maybe employee training on
how to use the new password complexity

233
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:52,600
so that could be another specific task
and even just monitor monitoring what's

234
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:00,720
kind of happening with your project
could be another task that's kind of how

235
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:14,220
you there'll be an example of Jalen
security teams and my presentation
