1
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:31,810
started this is the most fiber packed
talk I think I've ever done especially

2
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,199
at a hacker's conference is hard to fill
a room when you're talking about flow

3
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:44,610
charged when we could be talking about
exploits attack methodologies and those

4
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,089
types of things but it's my lot in life
to go around and work with enterprise

5
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:59,290
customers and fix what's broken I am a
tool vendor so often vendors wonder

6
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,850
about tools but I one thing I'm finding
systematically broken is the lack of a

7
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:11,760
process that connects it all together so
real quick we're gonna head on this very

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,950
quickly rapid fire but out of this talk
I want you to be able to go back to work

9
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,719
and fix things next week 6 the way we
talk to dinner six ladies are to each

10
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,009
others dicks the way to actually catch
and spawned reaches and so I'm not gonna

11
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,259
try to sell you on process in this MTG
how to do it so here's why it's

12
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,219
important vendors

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:41,600
evaluating tools to solve problems where
our customers we all share the exact

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,909
same marketing department we talk about
tools the same way we do it

15
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,859
analytics or behavioral and houses and
if you were here last year I went

16
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,759
through the academic schools of thought
on that would be an army detection and

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,140
some other things those do but I this
year at RSA and other conferences

18
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,439
everyone every vendor talking about
behavioral an anomaly detection so it's

19
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,410
the same it wears on you

20
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,190
to have you can have a real conversation
because all the messages on the same the

21
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,410
other problem is those are having
execute him prozac are having a

22
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,110
challenge communicating with management
and management having a difficult time

23
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,670
communicating with executives and the
Board of Directors on why it's important

24
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,200
to have a specific tool to higher
headcount and to make changes that are

25
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,350
important in a music on vernacular and
lasting as staffing skilled InfoSec

26
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:54,080
folks I started my career and impose
sack and i actually in 2001 when I was

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,880
active duty in the military and we were
at that point had no one to do anything

28
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,410
I was actually aircraft mechanic just a
few weeks before I was trying to catch

29
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,390
China stealing information and it still
is a problem how do we train people to

30
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:18,050
do advanced security issues about
process and so this is how its supposed

31
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:26,360
to look up over here but policy dictates
what we want to do how should we act

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,260
what should people do how should we do
things process is the piece it tells us

33
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,290
how to do that how to operationalize it
and if we're not supposed to go to

34
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,530
certain places on the web site how do we
operate our on the internet how do we

35
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,100
operationalize it and people are
supposed to execute the process is

36
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,190
documented and tools are suppose to

37
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:54,350
enable the people to execute the process
that allows our policy but unfortunately

38
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,830
we skip the process

39
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,570
piece I don't sell process I don't get
paid for process my company is not to

40
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,610
happy that you're talking about process
because we can turn a profit on that but

41
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,660
so we said we talk about tools so much
about tools and putting our faith and

42
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,350
tools but really the answer isn't in
tools and it's not necessarily in people

43
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:21,620
if they're not connected through process
so as I meet with organizations of

44
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,750
different shapes and sizes I find almost
categorically this is the InfoSec

45
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:35,220
process something happens did our stuff
catch it if not smart people do so we're

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,750
going to use our influence X killed go
in there and senior now there's a lot of

47
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:47,070
problems with this one is it's very
difficult to train and staff with

48
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,960
someone they can do food that's an
expensive person that orange blocks very

49
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,680
expensive secondly you can really get it
you can't go back and figure out if they

50
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:06,240
did through correctly and you can gauge
the success of the food so the reality

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,660
is we need something to this man as my
chart on this ok but we break down in

52
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,320
break that do sue into smaller
compartments and the idea behind this is

53
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,870
that we can start engaging

54
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:26,710
how effective are different I tolls are
at addressing areas and and our ability

55
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,950
to execute on them so the first thing I
do is my favorite part is when I get the

56
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:38,960
operators in a room the guys that are
actually doing the work not the managers

57
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,990
are the policy people but the guys are
received the tickets and say there's a

58
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,550
there's an infection or the people that
have to review the logs and we get them

59
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,020
all in a room and we focus on two to
three hours you have someone that takes

60
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,690
quite stunning questions are raised on
the answers

61
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,980
bringing food or beer and we work
through it the questions we ask strange

62
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,960
questions that don't regulate get asked
inside of organizations because we're so

63
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,110
busy putting out fires that we don't
take a step back and evaluate how are

64
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,840
actually operationalizing things so
things like how to block a specific

65
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,610
types of attacks how to block know now
where is your day malware how do we

66
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,520
block unauthorized access Holly block
folks jumping online access points what

67
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,810
do we currently do to address these
issues

68
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:34,480
secondly when something gets through the
blocking if so bad it makes it in how do

69
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,250
we detected a machine becomes
compromised of different types and then

70
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,800
really the one of the most fundamental
missing pieces and Mpho SEC right now is

71
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,920
how do we determine impact of an event
if we have a notification that a machine

72
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,450
was compromised with a piece of malware
how do we go back and determine what it

73
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,890
did was compromised machines that
communicate with what data did it take

74
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,950
what was the impact business of an
infection unfortunately because we don't

75
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,170
have documented processes the amount of
time that would be required is so

76
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,870
massive that we skip these things and
the end result is we don't learn

77
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,980
internally what actually happened

78
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,820
the next piece beyond this is really far
beyond a lot of organizations is the

79
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,040
ability to Rachel analysis we figured
out what happened who did it I what the

80
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,660
impact was the now we need to roll the
clock back and say okay is this the

81
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,810
first time this has happened to us or is
it a systematic ongoing problem and the

82
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,350
only way to do that is to take the
indicators a compromise documented in

83
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:46,090
the impact part and look throughout his
historical data for summer markers and

84
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,530
then lastly how to actual report
information so we just collect that on

85
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,130
the detection East so I skipped blocking
weekend at the bottom of it how do you

86
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,760
actually catch one now wears too tempted
with a very one of the Fortune 50

87
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,850
companies no longer and it's either a TV
or the help desk phone rings that's how

88
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,130
they detect malware the computer's
acting out that's pathetic but that's

89
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,610
what it was how do you change 0 days so
there is no signature when it enters an

90
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,790
hour energy network but then it later at
some point becomes known in there is a

91
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,300
signature how do you detect 0 day how do
you look at indicators a compromise

92
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,700
things like nomads URLs bad patterns bad
attacks how do you catch for outlook for

93
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,140
bad behavior seems like scanning the
network using those types of things how

94
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,340
do you text network anomalies and
enjoyed a breakdown on their behaviour

95
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:49,490
in our economic things go to last year's
deal on port want our care and then we

96
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,180
go back we take the logs all these
things that we did detect we want to

97
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,070
pull that data out and normally I do an
assessment over thirty day period you

98
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,910
can do it longer but look how many of
these things that we catch up we taught

99
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:06,670
for catching no malware through McAfee
AV how many of those things that we

100
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,240
catch and so we need to put some volume
numbers it is and then same thing in

101
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,260
response have an honest conversation
here how long does it take us to get

102
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,990
infected machine off the network and
cleaning how long does it take us to

103
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,380
determine the impact of a breach

104
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,800
with the tools and prostate how many
hours as take how long does it take us

105
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,510
to figure out

106
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,380
mapping network communications team our
files retro flow analysis you looking

107
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,140
for communications in the past that
match the pattern saying profile and in

108
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,280
documents the documents the documents
via tools and there is no really carry

109
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,660
dis so that the reason we do an
investigation is that we learn from an

110
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,970
incident so that we can change the way
we're doing things that doesn't happen

111
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,250
again if if we're not able to do that
there's no point in doing an

112
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,580
investigation frankly at the tops an
example of terrified in result from

113
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,110
investigation that would be something
like this host a connection to Ukrainian

114
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,600
host be at 8 a.m. on January 1st 2015 a
downloader and executed an unknown type

115
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,650
of malware was later classified as my
word I TBC upon compromised hosts a

116
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,540
began reconnaissance on the network
infected for other machines collected

117
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,590
1.3 gig of traffic from the sheriff or
browse shares to forex trading at STP

118
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,070
server in eastern europe retro analysis
revealed six other machines have been

119
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,750
compromised on a network of former manor
here's the user and it tends to be

120
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:43,830
unintentional but if if the tools are in
place for answering those questions this

121
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,080
is actually very common what we get is a
very small said this not actionable so

122
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:58,480
with that said I me roll into what you
doing this I just tweeted are given the

123
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,820
resources later but you can download
these Vizio documents and surpassing the

124
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,270
stuffing ourselves

125
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,770
but France's how do we catch potential
abuse that something someone that uses a

126
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,560
password username and password to do
something they shouldn't bother stealing

127
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:21,080
data as an insider or Spearfish
credentials how many of those that are

128
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:28,350
logs catch per month on impact how long
does it take us to review the logs and

129
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,510
the percentage on the impact is how what
the probability is that we're gonna

130
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,630
catch they're actually gonna catch the
data that we need to find you if you had

131
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,800
every long if you have every log on
every machine that's a hundred percent

132
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,640
metric so real quick on the three phases
I like to think about the things we can

133
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,260
block or prevent from happening so you
just count up how can we only care about

134
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,000
how many things we did block we care
about how many things got through and so

135
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,980
what this is going to be are the events
that we detected that we didn't block so

136
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,090
maybe an intrusion detection system
maybe it's got help you Brian Krebs

137
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,370
calling but the things that passed
through and we detected that weren't

138
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:20,200
block how many of those things happened
in the monitor period and then detection

139
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,700
during or detection you look at these
different mechanisms that are catching

140
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,840
things how many of these things are
happening again this will just be the

141
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,980
top how to catch known malware how 2:02
a.m. our how to catch prudential abused

142
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,840
how do we catch IOC's in this type of
things and we just chillin how many of

143
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,080
these things happen every month and then
finally on the investigative piece we

144
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,720
look at how long it takes us to do
something and then once we have all

145
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,590
those things still down from the energy
to and from the log collection we do

146
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:59,880
some math and the massively not that
complicated but is transformational

147
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,250
the number of events to investigate are
the are pulled from the logs and a good

148
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,380
way to do this if you're doing an
evaluation you call on the vendors that

149
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,740
are always annoying you like me or
whoever and let them put their tools in

150
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,730
and let them for that thirty day period
detect everything and you aggravate that

151
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:24,300
data and now you have you know given
with the current technology can detect a

152
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,790
we detected a hundred of the answer two
hundred of them so whatever it might be

153
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,840
and that falls into the invariable here
the total of them said we would need to

154
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:41,350
investigate and monitor appear in a
month right and then the total events

155
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,470
would actually be the Delta so if you
have a tool sad and then you bring in

156
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,190
additional tools and there's additional
tools catch things that your existing

157
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,690
tools don't catch there is a difference
between that often with new technologies

158
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:01,890
we might catch twice as many events than
you would with traditional stop so that

159
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,370
team is going to be at least as big as
in detecting everything becomes

160
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,510
detectable would be that time for
investigation you take all those green

161
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,340
blocks how long does it take us to do
retro bioanalysis how long does it take

162
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,740
us to do retro flow analysis and you add
all those blocks office who were to do

163
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,780
all those things on every investigation
would be the total time to do one

164
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,740
investigation clearly and you multiply
those out divided by on sixty which is

165
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,930
number of hours and after years of
full-time employees have and you have to

166
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,470
have these metrics and the reason this
becomes important now that I just bored

167
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,500
to tears on how to build this report I
knew I needed

168
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,840
is when I come in as a vendor and I want
to sell you a new tool now we have a

169
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,790
mechanism for one evaluating it was
actually good for the business and 24

170
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,960
having a conversation to sell it
internally and this is frankly the

171
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,920
reason I came up with this is because I
wanted to show that I might just bring

172
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,070
in new features so I worked for old
magazines for about six years doing

173
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,610
product testing network security here
and we had to do these comparative

174
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,620
matrix or matrices right and this tool
has this teacher in the store has this

175
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,960
feature but I often found warehouse
testing them to the devices that have

176
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,010
less features were better and I was
trying to understand why they were

177
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,320
better in the end result was your
ability to impact business process and

178
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,400
so if you take the before picture and by
the way these are actually real numbers

179
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:46,210
from a place I mention that you don't
know them they have 285 of bits per

180
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:53,160
month with our current tool set it to
them sixty nine hours to investigate it

181
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,260
so that would require a hundred and
twenty-three FTE in there and Sarah

182
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,110
sports teams so

183
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,740
Nicholas amount of people came in their
system partners are brought in some

184
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,770
tools we thought would be effective and
bringing in that stack reduced their

185
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,930
requisite Ste 420 still pretty high so
we need to bring in some services well

186
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:23,540
but this level is important because what
you can go back to the vendor in say is

187
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,930
you either need to reduce you have to
reduce my number of bits that if you can

188
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,720
find anyone that can do that that's
going to have a quick return because

189
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,390
it's going to have an immediate impact
on FTE and the reason and then you take

190
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,020
this up to management say look this is
why we need the tool because it's not

191
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,150
just good for security for business

192
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:54,200
and a vendor can do this using the tool
the next one is talking to management

193
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,680
you're not sick of what management years
when when we bring in tools is the

194
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,790
security nerds want a new toy right
that's what they're hearing when we say

195
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,640
no you understand we need advanced
malware sandboxing or were you know big

196
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,690
data analytics or whatever it is we need
us and whether hearing is the nerds need

197
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,410
some more tools and so we need to raise
the conversation above that and so this

198
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,860
block being able to say if we bring the
tools in we can reduce represent FTE

199
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,540
from $120 in this case we can reduce the
risk to the organization or only

200
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,880
catching half of things we could catch
that's a risk problem so now instead of

201
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,490
having a conversation around features
tools those types of things were having

202
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,900
a business our conversation and lastly
the reason I think this is most critical

203
00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:01,590
to InfoSec is my first gig that are paid
for information security was also

204
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,440
network security officer for the us-
Naval Postgraduate School and the chief

205
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,370
of staff asked me what I needed to do
that and i said i don't know who

206
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,310
captained give me a quarter million
dollars and seven sailors so we did gave

207
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,200
me those ago see the Comptroller well
then I had seven sailors who didn't know

208
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,720
how to do any thing InfoSec and so what
I found myself doing as I'm doing it all

209
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,760
and these guys are playing Call of Duty
right which was definitely frustrating

210
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,100
trimming so what we did as I took the
things that I did I put it out into a

211
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,680
process and then I would circle a
portion of it

212
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,520
take someone and say you are going to
take input from the previous guy here to

213
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,390
take the IP addresses you're gonna run a
query and you're going to determine

214
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:58,860
every host that infected host talk to
and if that infected if if on that list

215
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,710
is something that's critical you're
going to document it and then you're

216
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,670
gonna pass it on and then all this guy
does all day long as run these queries

217
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:18,460
very easy to train this guy the guy that
has to do food much more expensive so

218
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,350
when is it happening to a professional
development then if you bring a guy and

219
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,190
to do so analysis or to do

220
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:32,480
retro file analysis to do indicators of
compromise queries and you teach that to

221
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,860
him right you build the the how to do
that and then as he learns to master

222
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,640
that he's gonna contribute back into
improving that process and then for his

223
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,710
next phase and development he will learn
how to do the next piece and maybe after

224
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,360
he learns two or three parts of a part
of the process he might become a manager

225
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,500
guys are 18 we on the guys do this and
so you have a an ability to take a guy

226
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:06,530
that has acumen and attitude but doesn't
need to have twenty years of experience

227
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,450
many their belt

228
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:17,860
so are there any questions every time I
do a talk on it Onslow charged I know

229
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,800
this is what the faces are in a look
like it is a very high fiber type of

230
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,510
conversation and some of you have beer
and i dont have one which makes me like

231
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:35,640
you last many questions on this item go
the next slide there is a resource stock

232
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,070
on this is sort of an abbreviated
version of this talk but I messed up the

233
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:47,260
URL to Twitter Charles hearing had
tweeted the URL it's not currently there

234
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:54,480
but it's just a jerk on 2015 notes that
up somehow use your imagination and you

235
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,020
can download the deck and the video
templates and start placing in placing

236
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,030
in the different numbers but it is an
effective way to have conversations with

237
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:12,420
vendors had a with managers and train
people there's a lot of new talent here

238
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,600
that would love to get involved in
InfoSec but feels like it's too big and

239
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,090
hard part about this is they're gonna
learn the tools to doing a specific task

240
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:30,680
right it might be you know fire fire
fire amber crowd fire with fire through

241
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,530
one of those tools are doing our
analysis right or retro philomene learn

242
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,400
at school and they won't that tool you
can have someone up and running

243
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,490
helping the team in a very short period
of time so many questions anybody

244
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:50,270
somebody it thank you very much

245
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,140
you have your time back
