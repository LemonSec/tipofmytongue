1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,930
in the front row head to the back ready

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:27,019
321 go right for everybody is Brian rose
at home with the office of the sea so

3
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:33,670
from pop to work with them for five
weeks now so I just recently joined them

4
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,680
I spent two years as the chief security
officer for a company called Alliance

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,000
Data parent company for a number of
different companies like epsilon may

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,500
have heard of epsilon and then prior to
that I spent 14 years as the chief

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,449
information security officer for texas
instruments so I'm actually from Dallas

8
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,960
Texas and came up here for for the
copper and it's a little bit of a

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,910
homecoming for me because I grew up in
Jackson Michigan just down the road and

10
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,140
I also went to school at Michigan Tech
two people familiar with Michigan Tech

11
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,760
you P yeah it was really interesting so
Texas Instruments was pretty clever when

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,720
they were recruiting the idea college
actually flew me down interview in

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,460
December so I walked off the airplane in
Dallas Texas about the middle of

14
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,579
December I think it's around 75 degrees
and I remember telling hrt time if you

15
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:35,020
move me here I work for free the first
year and so I never looked back after

16
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,650
moving down there I do like coming back
to Michigan fact I'm going to head out

17
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,079
here after this at this conference and
visit with my brother and he slanting

18
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,340
but boy it's hard to be tired to leave
that nice sunny weather I woke up this

19
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,720
morning it was 37 I don't think we'll
see 37 till January so it's very

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,270
interesting but thanks for letting me
come and see today I talked about

21
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,189
security frameworks talk a little bit
about why companies should adopt them

22
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,000
give you a little highlight all the
different types of framework said there

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,149
are

24
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,340
talk a little bit about some of the
pitfalls and some recomendation so this

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,510
is not meant to be a dive analysis of
all the different frameworks

26
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,180
highlight some of the benefits how I've
used them in the past and how I continue

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,840
to use them and the other thing I would
like you to do is just kinda gotta pay

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,010
attention to some of the formatting of
the slides I can't take credit for all

29
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,489
of those my marketing department helped
me born at things I've learned along the

30
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,510
way is even if you have really good
information and even if you have very

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,190
correct information sometimes how you
present it is just as important as you

32
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,989
information itself because your computer
security you're speaking to executives

33
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:55,319
it's a tough thing for them to get their
hands around a lot time so try to make

34
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,189
analogies to physical security and as we
know that doesn't always line up direct

35
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:07,290
so really how you present your
information I can go a long way so far

36
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,530
keep inflation security officers their
job it radically changed in the past we

37
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,910
just have to worry about technology and
some operational activities but now the

38
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,069
scope of the job is his greatly increase
so they're having to worry about all

39
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,099
types of information risk and data risk
managing third parties

40
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:30,799
compliance some cases even privacy I was
responsible for privacy at Texas

41
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,629
Instruments when I was there so there's
there's a whole bunch of stuff be piled

42
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:41,190
on information security these days and
with that evolution you have a lot more

43
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,310
stuff to consider so we still have to
worry about all the old you know

44
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,400
traditional stack of data systems
network application and user now you

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,220
throw on things like big data cloud
mobility cyber insurance

46
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,859
talked yesterday and the guy was talking
about in Surrey spot and hunting so that

47
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:07,099
yet another thing to add to my to do
list as if you think about it this whole

48
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:12,019
laundry list of things that chief
information security officers have to

49
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,039
consider to actually get kind of
overwhelming when you sit down and put

50
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,230
together your plan

51
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,500
for next year how do you make sense of
all that information how do you make

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,780
sense out of the hundred 200 different
things that you could do next year

53
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,610
what's the right one to choose how do
you know you're choosing the right one

54
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,170
that's right I think frameworks come in
and really help out but even if you

55
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,360
think you have a good plan put together
something like this would happen if this

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,820
ever happened you but it's happened to
me another times in the past some new

57
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,240
headliner come out for my bosses swing
by my office with a photocopy of our to

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,120
call and say hey you say are we ignoring
these five best practices can you give

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,080
me a report by the in today and let me
know how we're doing or worse the CFO

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,820
comes back from a business trip he read
CFO magazine or see CIO magazine and he

61
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,970
comes back with you know they hear a top
10 cyber security questions that they

62
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,600
say CEO should ask can you give me an
answer to each one of these ten

63
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,010
questions so now that just totally
derail my activities can now I gotta get

64
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,010
one of my architects and other members
of my security team off going in finding

65
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,080
answers to all these questions so again
with all this whirlwind of activities in

66
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,610
things that interrupt your plans you how
do you stay on track I think that's

67
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,090
where frameworks come in so I tried to
group these frameworks into a couple

68
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,170
different areas so the first ones around
regulatory frameworks hopefully you're

69
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:47,370
familiar with some of the East Newark I
don't usually see security people who

70
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,280
raised her hand and jumping up and down
and yeah I want to follow that framework

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,410
I want to file that standard especially
if you're not in the health care

72
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,350
industry I don't see too many
manufacturing retail companies adopting

73
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,920
hippos are framework but if that's an
area that you're in a good place to

74
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,320
start

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,430
I mean it's better than nothing give it
give it a shot but again you really need

76
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,800
to take a look at what what your
industry is like the other a grouping is

77
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,680
what we traditionally see right we're
all pretty familiar with these security

78
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,910
frameworks and may not be 100% dedicated
to security it may be related to audit

79
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,640
risk management but these are our
framework said I suspect many of you

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,040
recognize and have checked out at one
time or another

81
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,240
last year I don't know if I really would
call them frameworks but you can use MS

82
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,860
frameworks may be thinking more US
protocols or methodologies something

83
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,030
like you know protect detect react not a
framework but it's a way that you could

84
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,540
group your security controls and your
security priorities bring some bring

85
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,040
some sense into the madness what
framework is right for you so I

86
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,350
apologize if your gonna come here
thinking I was going to say hey you

87
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,640
framework access to this really not
quite that easy it's almost like asking

88
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,460
yourself you know what's the best diet
or exercise program for me I we all have

89
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,220
different body types different
metabolism different physical abilities

90
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,380
so there's really no one quite program
for everybody but they all can be

91
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,550
successful

92
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,720
to a degree if you follow them properly
and Pete different people are going to

93
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,200
have different success with different
program I think the same is true

94
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,010
security framework everybody's going to
have their own degree of success but you

95
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,000
can do start asking yourselves and
different types of question so again do

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,140
you accept credit cards for payment so
then you have to follow PCI PCI the only

97
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,480
framework you should follow probably not
but it gets a good place to start a good

98
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,840
way to look at your security program
couple of the ones I thought were

99
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,169
interesting is does your cyber security
insurance policy call out a specific

100
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:05,110
framework we're starting to see more and
more insurance companies who are writing

101
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,140
policies around cybersecurity the game
much more detailed in their analysis of

102
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,110
your cyber security program not having
seen one yet that will give you

103
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,150
you know a premium break if you're
following a particular framework but

104
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,330
having a framework that you are
following certainly makes a good

105
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,540
impression on the people they're doing
the assessment and the other question

106
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,440
number ten do you have any customers or
partners that have contractual

107
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,510
obligations on you know I didn't
experiences from a framework standpoint

108
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:43,320
but years ago when Nokia was ti's number
one customer inquiries to do to you

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,480
three billion dollars worth of work for
them they asked us to do something with

110
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,200
that got a lot of attention at the
executive level so when they said hey

111
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,970
and be sure be nice if you guys did disk
encryption just what came my top

112
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,610
priority for that year right rolling out
disk encryption see my wife take a look

113
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:07,310
at at what your partners and suppliers
are are following as well

114
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:14,290
really keeping is can you answer that
question why did you pick that framework

115
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,480
so if you look at the latest misstep
security framework yeah comfort Texas so

116
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,960
a lot of security directors that I know
come from the oil and gas industry so

117
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,700
they're adopting the new cybersecurity
framework so they can provide a pretty

118
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,700
compelling argument to people why they
chose a framework they say well you know

119
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,050
the president you know signed Executive
Order

120
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:43,030
3636 to improve critical infrastructure
cybersecurity over 3,000 security people

121
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,360
both from the public-private academia
world participate in it is like a

122
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,730
year-long effort in any of you guys
participate in any of the workshops for

123
00:09:52,730 --> 00:10:00,250
development of that few people its
voluntary but if we follow it now it is

124
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,220
a good way

125
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,590
benchmarking with other peers in the
industry and it also promotes sort of a

126
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,620
nice standard terminology so when you
are benchmarking with peers are what you

127
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,040
are talking with regulators so you can
talk about you know those key areas

128
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,740
right protect detect respond identify it
gives you a way to talk about that as

129
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,040
well as to your board of directors so
that makes a lot more

130
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,070
compelling argument over why you chose
this framework now I don't know what

131
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,500
seemed like a good one at the time so
it's so he's in it so I thought I would

132
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,630
use it too so if you've got a method to
your madness I found that to be very

133
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,620
compelling as I was researching all
these different frameworks it's it's

134
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,800
hard to compare 01 2010 some are very
detailed prescriptive some speaking very

135
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,870
generalized terms but I did find
interesting is most frameworks spoke to

136
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,610
these four fundamental areas their
classification in nineteen access

137
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,569
management monitoring and then the
fourth was a little bit surprises

138
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:12,970
physical security even though we're
talking cybersecurity most of the

139
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,540
frameworks I looked at included some
element of a physical security see if

140
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,850
you don't choose a framework in your
program you know these are certainly for

141
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,569
areas that you take a look at you make
sure that you're addressing in your

142
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:29,130
program

143
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,360
I so it's not easy picking a framework
think about it I just showed you three

144
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,210
slide and I'm sure I didn't capture all
the different options that you have a

145
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,640
lot of choices you also have the
challenge that part of the framework may

146
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,220
not necessarily apply to your company to
your industry and so what I see a lot of

147
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,120
security people do is a sort of cherry
pick a fight over this part of ISO in

148
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,650
and they grab these elements for Mideast
they may grab through four elements from

149
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,020
the sands top 20 but the challenge with
that is you really don't get that nice

150
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,470
harmonious approach to to the framework
and then you're in a very uncomfortable

151
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,090
position to answer the question but what
about this piece and you got it and you

152
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,030
may have to fend off the questions of
well you just left that part of the

153
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,540
former got because you knew you wouldn't
great very well to order you knew we

154
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,940
weren't following so put you in a real
tough spot also I think the the other

155
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,730
challenges some of these are huge I mean
COBIT has gotten monstrous over the last

156
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:41,100
few years than even the mississippi 350
pages to read the entire this document

157
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:48,630
case you got a few people I don't think
I've read science fiction book lately

158
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,160
that was 450 pages so that's going to be
quite a challenge for me the other

159
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,120
problem I see with some frameworks
they're very point I PCI is one that

160
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,390
comes to mind are you doing this yes or
no so you can answer yes I'm doing that

161
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,600
now and then when the leaves you go in
turn all that stuff back off so it

162
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,340
doesn't necessarily providing nice nice
view and picture of your security

163
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,900
program and then you still have to know
your business as you go through it so

164
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,250
again frameworks it's not the end all be
all there's going to be some challenges

165
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,320
but the Deathly are some benefits so if
we look at what some of those benefits

166
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,920
are things I really like is that it
packages all the various controls and

167
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,550
things you could do into a

168
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,720
a nice group so it gives you a way to
junk up your security program and all

169
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,510
the different projects and activities
that you could do a very organized

170
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:49,250
looking for a more when you have that
nice grouping you can then take into a

171
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,760
security assessment I found security
assessments to be with a framework to be

172
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,810
a great way to present information back
to your executives I like this heat map

173
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:07,180
style because youre blocks of red really
jump out at you and draw your attention

174
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,709
also like doing the maturity score 125
because again just cause you have dop

175
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,810
doesn't necessarily mean that you're
monitoring it correctly you got the

176
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,779
proper responses and etcetera

177
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,760
so you having some combination of a
scoring system really comes in handy but

178
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,959
again breaking that up by by the
framework components again makes it much

179
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,649
easier to read and much easier to
analyze when you have all that nice

180
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,850
information about the current state of
your program you can then create your

181
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,680
priorities for the year again you can
kind of Groupon by those framework

182
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,190
elements come up with more detailed
recommendations maybe even look at what

183
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,670
it would cost to implement that but
again it's nice because it's time back

184
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,190
to that framework so in some cases will
why should I spend money on disaster

185
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:01,430
recovery you can back up and say well if
you notice this is an area of red in our

186
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,950
area and this ties back to this part of
the framework therefore we feel that

187
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,690
something that's important for us to to
focus on this year that presents a nice

188
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:17,910
compelling argument of what you're
trying to do it she over time as you as

189
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,120
you let that project now you got another
way to measure results and again

190
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,160
hopefully different squares on your
dashboard or changing green your

191
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,959
maturity scores going up and again you
can track all that again back cross your

192
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,800
your security framework in your
dashboard is really the other thing I

193
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,170
like to do is use my framework for
awareness even though I may change the

194
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,260
look and feel a little bit again the
categories in the terminology that I'm

195
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,170
using are consistent

196
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,430
and this is easy way to go talk to other
executives across my company about what

197
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,700
we're doing and security rather just
showing up with you know a big text text

198
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,010
document what I'm trying to do this is
something that's easy I rarely get an

199
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,630
hour of time with the CFO or VP of Sales
and Marketing

200
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,790
I can get fifteen minutes or 20 minutes
and I can walk into his office with this

201
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,040
one or two sheets of paper and hand it
to him and again he's gonna look at that

202
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,329
and you know being the critical business
leader that he is he's going to focus on

203
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:24,690
the down arrow for the red and started
asking me questions so that allows me to

204
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,570
have a conversation with him about the
security program what we're trying to

205
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:34,209
achieve and why so this is a great way
to to facilitate that conversation yet

206
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:38,630
think it's nice about this is I can't be
everywhere

207
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,110
some of us work for a really large
companies seventy eight locations around

208
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,870
around the world so I can handle this
with a few speaker notes to the CIO hey

209
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,760
when you travel to India you can you
have a conversation with the site

210
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,470
manager or with some of the other
leaders there and here's some

211
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,320
information that you can share with them
to promote that that information sharing

212
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:06,870
allows me to get some help in spreading
my security word Arab I'm not trying to

213
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:13,250
eradicate that you need to set your goal
to turn your frame are tall green or

214
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,709
reach maturity level 5 I really see this
is just one part of the strategic

215
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,319
development lifecycle

216
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,939
certainly you want to look at what your
business priorities are and what your

217
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:29,669
eye key priorities are but also if you
have these assessments and you have this

218
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:34,250
framework again it allows you to make a
compelling argument over why you chose

219
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:42,720
this project or this priority over
another one

220
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:55,360
credibility to your security journey as
you go along so one example is I took

221
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,140
all of the security controls and
security activities and mapped into the

222
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:05,159
kill chain methodology for me with that
one from Lockheed Martin you people are

223
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,750
what was interesting it's a crime map
everything to it I realized that towards

224
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,120
the end of the cold chain I didn't have
any control looking for outbound traffic

225
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,390
so most of the security investors that
we were making were designed to protect

226
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:28,630
against incoming threats ride and access
management even around monitoring of

227
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,789
lateral movement but nothing looking
outward going so when I went to see if

228
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:38,659
it had think we need to invest in some
additional security technology like fire

229
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:44,530
I think that's looking at outbound
traffic again when you ask you know but

230
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,549
GOP last year we bought the hell out of
the year before you why do you need yet

231
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:52,780
another security control and I can show
him that that killed chain model say

232
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,890
well as you can see if somebody were to
get through our nasa defenses and start

233
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,940
sending data I have no visibility or no
way to stop that attracted so it

234
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,429
presents get a much more compelling
argument for my budget discussion with

235
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:13,100
somebody by having that information
framed in a way that if I hadn't mapped

236
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,940
it to that that killed chain it would
have never been obvious that that was a

237
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,549
big gap for us so the other thing that
was really helpful is we get audited by

238
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:28,159
client and government agencies a lot and
so it's nice when they come and say hey

239
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,650
what your security strategy rather than
just saying well we got all these cool

240
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,100
tools and we do all these do all this
monitoring like a while we follow San

241
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,299
stopped 23 to control framework hearsay
heat map of where we've applied those

242
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:49,900
different roles and how we're doing
anyway we had to set up the sand top 20

243
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,330
controls down one side and along the top
we had people process

244
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,960
technology and govern it so we scored
each one of those sand items against

245
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,690
those four areas and we were able to
present a picture of you know this is

246
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,380
how we are today here's my road map for
this year in the next two years to try

247
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,710
to address some of the big gaps in the
dashboard and this is a strategy that

248
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,330
were off and what I found is you get a
lot less questions from regulators and

249
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,760
customers and client when they see that
you have any information in a strategy

250
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,399
as well put together and easy to present
to them in a way that they can

251
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:32,919
understand so we just got a recap some
of the benefits of using a free market

252
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,970
how you can use it again you can you get
it nice insight into foundational

253
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,039
components allows you to highlight areas
that need attention they may not need

254
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,110
attention it may not be a big risk area
for you but again at least it helps

255
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:51,490
drive the conversation to see if that's
an area that needs focus supports your

256
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:57,059
strategic development helps you measure
your progress it really helps with

257
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,860
awareness materials in providing proof
to third parties and again I think it

258
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,139
provides even more credibility to your
program in your approach overall going

259
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:11,760
forward so some key takeaway again I
will leave you with this certainly use a

260
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,169
framework if you don't already today or
try to pick one and stick with it for

261
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,289
you know to three years so you can kind
of measure and track your progress and

262
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:25,279
everyone to a look at grab another
framework and Matt to that may uncover

263
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,899
some hidden things that you hadn't
discovered the past involve your

264
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,559
business when you're looking at these
frameworks and answer the questions of

265
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,809
whether your red yellow greener to level
12 or 3 and know that is just one of

266
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:44,049
many tools that you can use to package
your strategy in a special security

267
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,899
program but again I think it's very
useful very helpful and it's one of

268
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,480
those things that's been around for
years and years and years and so a lot

269
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,159
of times when I find it people forget
about that for the oh yeah that's right

270
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,049
I forgot about myself so it's a good
approach to use and something that had a

271
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:06,659
lot just within the past and are
starting to hear

272
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,869
even some words around if you are
compromised or breached if you can show

273
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:17,220
evidence that you were following a
framework and had a solid strategy that

274
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,009
that could lessen some of the the
financial impact and some of the county

275
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:26,539
in fact that you would recede I don't
know if thats officially true yet but

276
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:31,979
talking to some colleagues who have gone
through that they found that regulators

277
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:37,609
have been much more forgiving when they
were able to say look what more can I do

278
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:41,200
not following this industry standard
framework here is our plan we were

279
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,840
marching towards it

280
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,169
you I can only do so much in one year so
they got a little bit of a break there

281
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:54,789
so I tension was not take up the whole
hour I know when I 10 properties I hate

282
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,909
trying to rush from 11 session to the
next i know im right before lunch as

283
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:04,099
well so I just wanted to give you sort
of a quick overview of frameworks and

284
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:08,269
how have used in the past to answer any
questions

285
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:31,410
yes sir

286
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:57,090
coming up with standard questionnaire so
you've got criteria for why why that's a

287
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:04,860
level wonder why that two yellow so I
have documentation I have a tool I have

288
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,030
somebody dedicated to monitoring it

289
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:12,690
etcetera so usually what we do is we
would have three to five questions or

290
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,780
maybe multiple questions for each
maturity level for each color and then

291
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,410
we would come up with some agreement oh
ok if I answer you know four out of five

292
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,430
correct that's a green if I answer three
out of five you know that too maybe a

293
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:32,650
yellow and then that way I turn any
argument into either other questions I

294
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:37,940
should ask hers or would you rather be
five out of five first-degree rather

295
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:45,460
than attacking the methodology or the
end result sure I've had that challenge

296
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,630
to when using you do something you say
WOW 1.6 maturity level and then I've got

297
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,120
engineers trying to argue that it should
be 1.7 in the end that really doesn't

298
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:08,530
change the conversation it's still well
I still need help in that

299
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:16,160
I don't see certification hear the
question it was which frameworks are we

300
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,560
seeing more requested in which ones

301
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,220
requested I don't hear as much about I
so I don't know if that's because it's

302
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,050
been around long time and everybody's
already familiar with it so it's not as

303
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:34,960
requested as often the the two that i've
seen the most requested this because

304
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,780
it's new it's got presidential executive
order behind it so you're starting to

305
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,890
see more and more companies look at that
the other one is the San stopped when

306
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,840
and I think the reason for that is it's
pretty easy to get your arms around it

307
00:25:51,840 --> 00:26:01,420
only twenty it's not like I think I saw
has 114 116 controls and missed is that

308
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:07,430
so it's pretty easy they are 20 I can
create a spreadsheet to 20 in two or

309
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:13,850
three columns with it and so I find that
special for smaller companies or groups

310
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:45,690
would have smaller security program they
really like the clean that

311
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:52,519
question for vaca is so I had security
responsibilities and also privacy

312
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:58,870
responsibility Texas Instruments so how
did I how did I manage both factors of

313
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:06,529
it when sometimes they can they can be
in direct conflict so the challenge so

314
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:11,519
one of the nice things I head to Boston
so what was the CIO

315
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,860
I T security standpoint and the other
was General Counsel former Labor

316
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,440
Department from a privacy standpoint so
I was getting getting direction both

317
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,320
ways

318
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:29,330
also a number of the controls and
technology that we would you to promote

319
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:35,509
privacy protect privacy where technology
base so I was able to work that into the

320
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:45,159
system in the grand scheme of things
from an org chart got here and CIO here

321
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:50,919
so if there's ever a copy using one and
it also helped me because sometimes I

322
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,299
wasn't that difficult situation of
knowing wow this is really a bad idea

323
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:59,990
for privacy standpoint but CIO signs my
check so what do I do so I can go to him

324
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:07,340
in direction there wasn't it wasn't as
bad as it sounds but on the other hand

325
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:12,559
jobs in manufacturing company so it's
not like we had a ton of personal

326
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,049
information you wouldn't take credit
card we didn't have health records and

327
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:23,120
things like that most of our stuff with
IP protection might be a little bit more

328
00:28:23,120 --> 00:29:02,390
challenging if you were in a healthcare
company

329
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:09,820
together any better to be honest I still
think it's pretty fragmented situation

330
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,650
you know we like to talk about how you
see so far in the risk management

331
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,210
business and it sounds great but in
reality when you get right down to it

332
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:25,310
you were in the iraqi security business
when you get right down to it I see risk

333
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:32,440
tends to be much more driven out of
legal everyone to I i've seen some

334
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,020
actual risk groups but again they also
tended to be separated and the Alliance

335
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,820
Data where I worked we did have a risk
management team that rolled up under

336
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:51,620
under financed or not but again it was
two separate e so we tried to work

337
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,230
together but they manage their own risk
register and so really it's all about

338
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,960
right now just about collaboration when
you have a good example of where it too

339
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,370
well well unifying love to hear about it
but I hate to say it but you haven't

340
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:14,980
seen the question

341
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:22,740
framework

342
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,580
information if you have any other
questions you wanna copy of the slide or

343
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,670
something like that I've done that
before when I've attended these events I

344
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,650
got up to the speaker and say hey I want
slide 10 because I really like how how

345
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,070
that was formatted I want to use my
companies so
