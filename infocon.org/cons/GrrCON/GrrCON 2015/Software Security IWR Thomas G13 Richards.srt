10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:48,570
quick run of the crowd who here is a

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,900
testers comment has to go through
reports and figure out that who here is

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,180
a practitioner in the security field
actually doing the pen testing and all

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,390
the fans of great pretty good mix
perfect that's what I was hoping for in

14
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,910
this talk I've been given the talk to
students for the past two years so is a

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,860
first talk in front of actual people so
we'll see how this goes against my name

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,360
is Tom Richards I am a senior security
consultant whistle we are a software

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,320
security firm based around the USA and
internationally

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,360
that's why Twitter account if you want
to follow me at school sometimes a tweet

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,240
sometimes they don't

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,550
I presented previously for I think this
is my third or fourth year here probably

21
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,390
the third speaking time here it's great
I love this conference I'm so glad to be

23
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:46,650
Francisco in various topics I'm an
organizer for besides rocky had these

24
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,260
sides

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,939
great congress's it have a b-side
locally to you definitely go to it

26
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:59,150
they're fantastic also a member for a
local 2200 this talk hopefully read my

27
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,229
description I'm gonna talk about some of
the things I've run into in the field

28
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,680
and what it means to do software
security and a consultant and I'm also

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,470
gonna give you guys some pointers when
you're looking at vendors and sort of

30
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,829
the other side of the table right when
you're going through this this life

31
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:21,670
cycle so the projects I have worked on
in my three years as usual have been

32
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,080
staff augmentation and a large financial
firm

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,760
where I was helping them in 2013 they
finally realize that they want to do

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,810
mobile so we were helping them securely
develop their mobile banking application

35
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,210
also their employee initiatives for BYOD
they were a large firm traditionally

36
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,550
blackberry there's anyone have to manage
mobile devices out there and have

37
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,990
everyone go I want my my Apple Android
to get email so that's what they were

38
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,310
facing people coming in with those
requests and they had some very

39
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,810
important information on there so I'll
talk about that later

40
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,530
bullpen testing traditional mobile
assessments web app assessments network

41
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,240
assessment you know traditional pen
testing sort of things that I've been

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,740
going through I also do quite a bit of
red teaming actually I'm leaving Sunday

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,770
to go break into a building in LA so yes
it's a lot of fun I get to do a lot of

44
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:25,290
fun stuff here in now with my more
senior position I do scoping calls in

45
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,459
helping out with the clients so if
you're on the consumer consumable side

46
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,450
of security when you get on the phone
with a vendor and go hey here's what we

47
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,150
want I'm usually the person on the other
end the phone going ok here's what we

48
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,160
have not sales I'm I'm after-sales
construe the sales process we figure out

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,040
how much you gonna charge you for this

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,850
that's when it gets to me so make sure
we understand your need and also make

51
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,830
sure our services are going to meet your
expectations so I'm doing that side of

52
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,150
the house now too and that's some pretty
interesting stuff to talk to clients

53
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:06,670
about that I've always viewed security
as the second level in industry right

54
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:13,690
coatings hard right writing software is
typical computers are hard

55
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,269
designing things as hard insecurity

56
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:23,240
is really hard right when you're going
through this tough as a consultant I

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,810
need to know as much or more than your
developers I need to know as much or

58
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,699
more even of your own system then your
system architects system engineers and

59
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,990
support staff this when I'm shy Indian
issues that relate to the security side

60
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,069
of your business I need to be able to
explain those and confident and

61
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,940
knowledgeable terms so that you
understand us you're not going to have a

62
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,849
vendor that is gonna sit there and go
all blah blah blah that's an issue

63
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,300
because it we say it's an issue you have
to have facts you have to defend why

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,050
it's an issue so we need to understand
that so why even tell kids I know

65
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,770
college students looking to get
insecurity I tell them do one or two

66
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,120
years maybe yeah what about one or two
years in industry in whatever you are

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
doing

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,099
network support system support or
developing as you want to go straight

69
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:25,729
into security you're gonna have a huge
curve you're gonna have to get over just

70
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:33,190
21 understand how companies work I've
had people work with me who had never

71
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,330
worked in an office before and we had to
go on a client site so if things we

72
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,750
might take for granted like office
etiquette and just interacting with

73
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,259
people in office where the break room is
and what's typically in the breakroom

74
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:53,289
these kids have no idea so I strongly
encourage if anyone is one person so one

75
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,440
person's gonna have benefit out of this
DNA industry for a little bit if you're

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,540
going into security before you do it
right down the long run

77
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,680
I have a really crappy

78
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,640
know if there's a from these he is the
CISO at somewhere I forget where he has

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,150
this is from one of his tweets and it
really brings to the front what software

80
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,660
security is then what we're talking
about my software security the network

81
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,210
layer is taken care of right we got that
padlock in the corner were good at SSL

82
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,780
were fine but this is where the software
security turns in you put a negative

83
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,670
number in your quantity

84
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:47,770
now the shopping cart owes you money
right this is the perfect example of

85
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,080
what software security is the network
layer is taking care of we got our

86
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,390
secure communications but the apt is
broken like I was saying I was at the

87
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,280
bank

88
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,730
a large financial investment firm
helping them design their mobile

89
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,680
application and that was really
interesting because you had to explain

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,330
to this bank what a secure mobile
application looks like what does that

91
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,550
mean what both Android and iOS because
that's the two popular ones you know

92
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,990
what what would that be you know what
things are we concerned about both on

93
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,290
the client side which you know you can't
trust a client at all and also on the

94
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,590
back end and that's where all the juicy
stuff was and that's what the line is

95
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,940
here with the devs they thought that its
mobile only the mobile phone as well

96
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,250
talk to our back-end web services like
no do you put a published web service

97
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,480
out there on the internet and the thing
is going to talk to it you have a

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,570
restful service fantastic but you need
to secure that system and that's why

99
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,180
he's into my next line was mobile
pushing security of accident I Indies

100
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:05,590
it's gotten better more lately but when
will was first coming out in 2010 2011

101
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,580
people were pushing his outset when
Android and iOS four really taking off

102
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,979
developers we're forgetting all the web
security stuff that they had been doing

103
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,669
for the past 20 years and we were
finding simple dumb things that they

104
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:28,919
were building into their backend systems
assuming that the only thing talking to

105
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,450
their backend was going to be the the
mobile device they still can't hit from

106
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,370
a web browser or through burp or
anything so we we told them they had to

107
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,130
fix a great cause you can't trust and
some decline you have to validate what

108
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:50,790
comes in and we built a pretty robust
system for them to to use BYOD this is

109
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,490
one of the worst ideas anyone's overhead
quite honestly I don't have to deal with

110
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:04,450
BYOD but it is just a pain yeah so you
know this investment firm deals with

111
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,910
very sensitive information they deal
with mergers IPOs

112
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,000
people acquiring other companies and
stocks that are coming out so very

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,760
critical information to have gone on
their and their staff are requesting to

114
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,529
use iOS and Android now for business
purposes and we're deal is really

115
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,860
sensitive information where email and
email on someone's device could

116
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,180
literally either make someone a couple
million dollars or lose someone that

117
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:41,519
millions of dollars so poking the bear
our iOS and Android as secure as

118
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:52,130
blackberry when looking at that sort of
data it is

119
00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:02,470
any kind either a pro work on procon in
my opinion it's not there's no way the

120
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,800
security controls that are available in
iOS and Android re years behind a

121
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,350
blackberry could do when it comes to
securing data on the device securing

122
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,270
communication between the device and the
backend server and just

123
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:22,610
the attack surface of the platform there
is no root exploit for blackberry now

124
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,550
they're coming out with an Android phone
in a couple months it was just announced

125
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,030
so that's going to change things in
vietnam be interesting but the

126
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:34,350
BlackBerry OS there is no root exploit
there is no root you cannot get root

127
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,890
access you can get real iOS and Android
every time there is a version right you

128
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:47,010
can do it I wasn't and read our consumer
devices adapted to the business world

129
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:54,670
Samsung has done quite a bit with Knox
and safe to produce some blackberry like

130
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,740
API is available for businesses to
manage but not every MDM vendor supports

131
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,710
everything that stayed put out there
that Samsung put out there so in my

132
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,020
opinion oh and we had to they had
classification levels for what was

133
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,370
sensitive data what was not and if your
email was too sensitive you are not

134
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,460
getting iOS because they could not
properly secure it in a way they would

135
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,120
secure blackberry in the government
looks the same thing to write government

136
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,570
still primarily uses blackberry when you
start to get into the design stuff right

137
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,540
Obama's out walk around with an injury
he has a blackberry so that's my two

138
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,530
cents and welcoming anyone talk about
that after the park are moving on simple

139
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:42,480
mobile at Penn testing sometimes you
know apps are are pretty good

140
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,340
other times they're just complete
garbage this one this example those who

141
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,230
are a fast food

142
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,500
vendor of beverages I I see some cups
from them in the room so we'll have them

143
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:02,320
nameless they split their code per
region so they started doing their

144
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,910
mobile development here in the states
and then for each localized region

145
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,110
basically each language you know Europe
was its own app or whatever they fork

146
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:17,490
the code for them to be able to develop
services in futures natively this one I

147
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,910
had to stop after two hours of testing
because literally just looking at the

148
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,260
application I had to stop at 29 find it
ridiculous that's an incredibly high in

149
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,140
number of findings within only a few
hours of testing they clearly didn't

150
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,150
smoke or do anything it was tough on
disk stuff going in the log file

151
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:42,090
passwords be inspected the logfile in
plain text and everyone knows on Android

152
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:47,800
any other app can actually requests the
the logfile to read so that's just

153
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:55,810
asking for trouble and SSL issues oh man
everyone sucks it to it as a so pls i

154
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:02,780
should say as a cell's dead we can't say
any more salty less every assessment

155
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:09,090
every assessment we find a cell issues I
did find her plain ones after it was

156
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,280
published which was pretty cool out in a
red team engagement against a law firm

157
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:21,070
and their the Kashi X externally exposed
McAfee's server was vulnerable to

158
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:29,560
harpley so we were not only not only
able to pull down the private key of the

159
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,960
server which you can you know it's true
that there to do that with are pleased

160
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,200
we were able to pull down their
corporate AZ policy we knew what apps

161
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,400
they were excluding

162
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,120
from being scanned and we knew what
directories they were also excluded from

163
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,730
being scared so we were able to directly
target our attacks to basically go after

164
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,290
office because the baby was not scaring
office so the first two we don't find as

165
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,460
much anymore

166
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,470
poodle we're still fighting s overs in
30 mins appreciate a fifteen years ago

167
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,250
turn it off invalid search that's a
pretty big 10 people have stuff that's

168
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,810
already expired out there or South
signed out there in weak ciphers

169
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,360
supported that that happens quite a bit
in a low little bit string cipher suites

170
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:26,010
it's just a second week and fixings very
easy to upgrade the software web app

171
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,010
testing you know it's one of the mill
when we get out there we're still

172
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,400
finding things that we found since the
nineties and early 2000 still injection

173
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,360
flaws we do find authentication
authorization issues here there there's

174
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,160
maybe a couple things on the top ten
specific loans and I haven't found the

175
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,120
request of testing but it's just you
know other people have here in there

176
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,550
right

177
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:53,930
larger companies have their act together
you know the banks to large ISPs they

178
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,120
really have their act together when it
comes to this so when we do QA testing

179
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,070
sometimes we don't find a lot of
interesting things sometimes we do just

180
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,600
one Development Group test isn't doing
stuff up to the corporate security

181
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,160
policy right cause these companies will
have development standards for

182
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,260
developers to use to have guidelines on
what to do and what not to do to make

183
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,400
sure their code isn't totally broken so
you know we find stuff when it gets to

184
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,280
us injection code level issues it's
someone's missing something smaller

185
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,990
companies tetramerous you know we had a
client come to us because their client

186
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,540
said that we had they had software
security issues so they need to get

187
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,130
tested and they recommended us so we
went through and did it

188
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,290
APIs just thoroughly broken you know
full sequel injection I dumped the whole

189
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,970
user database it was it's one of those
things where it's so broken you're

190
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,640
trying to figure out if you're going to
have enough time to finish the report

191
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:58,750
did something happen no ok you know
those those are still finding fun things

192
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,570
right where it exciting have a lot of
highs and you know you feel good about

193
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,580
yourself going through the report again
we broke this app smaller firms

194
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,710
definitely need like more help they
don't have the structure that larger

195
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:17,840
firms have to even have coding standards
or really know what a secure secure code

196
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,750
looks like when they're going through
I'm a client of this painting when a

197
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:34,700
client of this bank in one recognizes no
they do ok so I was given a username and

198
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,990
then also a token to sign in a
two-factor token right and that's the

199
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,470
primary method of signing in to the bank
is using your username and this to thank

200
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,550
her token which is pin and a randomly
generated number eight so it's fantastic

201
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,840
but you also have a password

202
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,150
could be instances where you're a dot
able to sign in with your token certain

203
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,900
functions of the app were disabled when
you did password off because they were

204
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,000
unable to really prove its you right you
don't have the token gesture password

205
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,859
could be anyone noticed tokens kind of
the same way but then this pops up when

206
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,760
you ask for your password right so they
didn't ask for me to just put my

207
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,830
password in they asked for the first the
second toe first six and second-to-last

208
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:33,480
password what does that indicate it's
encrypted yes they're not hashed

209
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,940
or plain text right to know it's
actually a versatile increase abacus

210
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,220
harassment that's awful so they were
story in the passwords in reversible

211
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:52,240
encryption and this is another large
bank doing this well it also changes

212
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,010
each time so it doesn't ask for the
first six and second elastic could be

213
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:07,380
like the second death and like the 7th
or whatever last night you said they're

214
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,810
going what the hell to first when you
pull up notepad or WordPad you write

215
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:20,580
down your password then go okay first
good yeah this is we said they were

216
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,170
store in the end reversible encryption
and only their backend servers can talk

217
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,830
to it so that's that's a positive

218
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:36,600
doin architecture was pretty interesting
to we had to do something for some

219
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,019
mobile apps to sign their system and
when it came to guidance for a secure

220
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,769
client side right that's pretty common
injury to Google publishes stuff Apple

221
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:51,490
publishes stuff that's pretty well
documented how to write a six sure

222
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,760
Android or iOS application things to
avoid things to include do when you're

223
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,860
going through the code it's the back and
that no one has a template for to figure

224
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,610
out that is secure and not and what does
that mean to make sure your back and

225
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,809
insecure validation authorization all
those issues are going to pop up in the

226
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:18,950
security line for this one yet so far
this one we reviewed they did have the

227
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:28,460
API said it was a RESTful API and this
client is a rewards application for fuel

228
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,029
ok so you buying gas so as you buy gas
it gives you were worried points to use

229
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:39,110
at other retailers or other nations to
save a couple sense offer to pump right

230
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:45,260
I was on the phone with this client
before they they get in and the security

231
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,760
group that brought us and was not you
know the developers right so we got on

232
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,840
the phone with developers in the
developer lee and this lady just says

233
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,990
straight out to us I only care about PCI
ok but there's no other things to worry

234
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,149
about here other than just PCI you know
there's you know these kinds of issues

235
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:09,289
in this is a testing for their going to
the conversation she was like whoa wait

236
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:16,100
wait wait is that a PCI issue or is that
a normal security issue

237
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,789
you and I was like you know that's
normal security issues like I don't care

238
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:25,330
the only thing this lady was concerned
about with the developers is to make

239
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:31,539
sure that your credit card number is not
stored in plain text for use in

240
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:36,130
plaintext transmission that was her only
concerned everything else be damned dump

241
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,990
everyone's information to screw
authorization just have a whole bunch of

242
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,179
fun as long as a credit card number is
an exposed you know we were good which

243
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:48,030
that's kind of silly you know when you
look at looking back at appreciate it

244
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,390
happened with the health care companies
you know and I get that email from

245
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,980
anthem and they go you know we got
preached yet all this information got

246
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,640
stolen but the good news is that your
credit card number was a compromise has

247
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,190
the story that I different server that
will fantastic the one thing I can

248
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:12,150
change overnight was the thing that was
installed in right so now my you know

249
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,850
four-year-old six-year-old
three-year-old in one year old kid has a

250
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,610
credit card numbers stolen which is
fantastic and thank you for the free one

251
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,309
year of credit monitoring for my one
year old kid that's really going to help

252
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,830
them when they're 18 and the people who
now have all their information

253
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,000
start opening up credit cards in their
accounts fantastic thank you anthem and

254
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:45,909
brand so indication they did have this
is back to the rewards application they

255
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:52,340
did requests you know then it have some
00 off like saying here they told us it

256
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,480
wasn't true awesome how random is in
there like it's random and we said ok

257
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,210
that's random user name password right
and the POST request so there was this

258
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:09,299
is the body so you have the body so they
were imposed you know putting get

259
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:15,080
quarries gets rings in which is good you
got back this information account number

260
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,630
was actually sequential across the
entire system this member I D was

261
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,830
interesting because that's what the user
would actually use a set of their

262
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,950
account number of your account number
was just how they kept track you on the

263
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,340
back and the member I D was how you
would also indicate at the pump if you

264
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,600
don't have your card to get your words
and the funding was is that member I D

265
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,530
was your phone number

266
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:48,280
blustery other digits so that was data
is a plus right decibel a things just

267
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,850
type in the pumps failed to get rewarded
but okay that was their system said it

268
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,440
was bad and then you would get back this
access token so separate from the header

269
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,450
access token which grants you access to
talk to the API's the access token was

270
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,620
supposed to be unique and highly secure
per session per user

271
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,990
right that's that's the goal they're
right so no one can take your token and

272
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,640
try to make calls on another user in
some method but then they do this so

273
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,830
this was a transaction history right

274
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,940
a member so you have what you're looking
for is this is public in business public

275
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,440
knowledge right up until here is public
knowledge by just looking at the traffic

276
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,460
of the application account number which
I already said with sequential that's

277
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,750
even more fantastic brute force this in
the only bits of information it needed

278
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:49,840
was the transaction number eighty I
access token and a start and end date

279
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,580
you could go through and enumerate every
person's transaction number

280
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,679
Christie were into passing the member
access token which is that token that's

281
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,760
supposed to prove that its you for that
session and tie it back to the account

282
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,040
number to make sure that access token
was actually supposed to talk to that

283
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,830
account number they were in doing it and
they also were in doing it for the set

284
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:18,280
preferences I could change things on
other people's accounts going through

285
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,900
because I could just enumerate account
numbers and change the preferences that

286
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,010
preference eighties I didn't get into
too much to know what it was like email

287
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,990
alerts and

288
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,960
some contact information nothing too
dangerous but still pretty juicy that

289
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,830
you could easily messed up a few
people's days by doing that and they

290
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,390
were not requesting the member access
tokens to that report was like copy and

291
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,940
paste implement proper authorization
authentication checks on you 'cause make

292
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,520
sure using actual token for each call
that was that was fine they the security

293
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,690
group liked it

294
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:02,050
the TCI lady did not like what all these
high findings for but an independent

295
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:07,190
este did implement all this stuff so
that's that's always fantastic goals in

296
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:14,260
the wild before I got professional
insecurity I was pulling down apps from

297
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,550
SourceForge get home anywhere I could
find web apps and just running free

298
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,600
scares out and seeing what would break
and this is only a snippet of the stuff

299
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,270
that I found in cross site scripting is
actually very difficult to fix as

300
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,870
opposed to a normal injection flawed
lexical injection legal injection you

301
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,890
just do privatize queries make sure you
don't mess up to parameterize query in a

302
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:43,570
good cross site scripting you have to do
input validation output encoding you

303
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:49,410
know there's more steps out there in
this was almost every app I look like

304
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,559
you know see we're going back to 2011 is
what I was getting a series of Science

305
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:59,370
in there were public instances of this
family connections at web calendar

306
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,660
you know on the internet I found it
wasn't as people were internally there

307
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:09,380
were public instances of the stuff that
they were trying to fix what they I

308
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,660
don't think they actually fixed because
the people stop developing this stuff

309
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,820
but that's that's dangerous writes a
pull-down open source code they're like

310
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,960
oh I need I wanna Booking Calendar

311
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,020
I want people to be able to submit
requests to book a room resources out

312
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,690
there and there's issues in it so code
has issues

313
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,799
everywhere open-source you know
commercially driven software it's all

314
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:40,450
their methods

315
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,890
going through these sorts of assessments
tends to be the same whether you're

316
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,540
doing a web app mobile app or a network
this example we're going to focus on a

317
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:57,320
web app going through the workflow
always follows this receptor first is

318
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,660
discovery information gathering what
does it do what does the app with his

319
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,620
dad lets its business contacts how does
it work and then you wanted it what's it

320
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,630
supposed to do and what's it's not
supposed to do according to developers

321
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:18,520
identifying inputs that's where the app
is gonna break right wherever the user

322
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,420
can input something in is most likely
where the fun is going to be injection

323
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,440
issues authorization issues as into
these issues will all be inputs using

324
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,610
password for the token or the cookie
that's where that fight that's what

325
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,620
happens and then US and the business
launder you know what is the pay is

326
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,980
there money involved is your shopping
cart is it a bank can you move money

327
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,620
what things are you not supposed to do
when you move money cross accountants

328
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,670
authorization issues those are the fun
ones to play with the business logic the

329
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:58,810
first two can be automated right running
crawler on the website looking for the

330
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:04,680
inputs any automated tool can be easily
do that it's the assessing the business

331
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,290
logic of the application that requires a
person right we don't have a i to the

332
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,150
point yet that can understand whether or
not you know you're supposed to you can

333
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,630
put a negative number in your shopping
cart and then retrieve money back from

334
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,930
the bank how is the computer gonna know
that

335
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:31,120
so that's where this ends up being fun
is poking at a soft spots of the

336
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,180
application you know what happens if I
do this here what happens if I do this

337
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,870
over here what happens if the parameters
are out of order

338
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:45,520
there's a system care about that we're
doing that properly to we're doing black

339
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,640
box testing will end up doing is trying
to figure out how it works behind the

340
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,480
scenes right if I was developer how
would I designed this system if I was

341
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:03,190
looking at this what what could this be
doing on the back and I'm surprised rash

342
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,690
is not here

343
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:14,920
his fender here for a number of years
but how much the owner of summer hits

344
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,320
company has broken box right anyone here
familiar with us right arm is right

345
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,090
rash is a fantastic I this quote really
speaks to the hacker mindset that we're

346
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:32,350
going through and and trying to do you
know the number one trait of a sexual

347
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:37,620
harasser its ability to reason with
things one cannot directly observe right

348
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,500
black box testing I cannot observe what
your back and is doing most of the time

349
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,850
sometimes we get access to you know to
the developers and we can see what

350
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,790
things look like on the back and which
helps to validate or invalidate

351
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:56,740
different findings but we're poking with
something that we can see what it's

352
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,030
doing we're just hoping it's doing what
they wanted to do or not wanted to do as

353
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,190
we're going to the testing and this this
quote is what I share with a lot of

354
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:12,330
folks going through this is all we have
to be able to do as a pen tester right

355
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:17,320
to be able to reason with that box that
system the application

356
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,690
to figure out what it should or should
not be doing is figure out ways you can

357
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:27,120
break it ok so now we get into all the
fun stuff for the consumers of security

358
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,710
out there after the assessment people
complain about report writing but

359
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,440
obviously that is the only piece the
only output of the assessment for

360
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,490
consumer for the most part is to report
the only tangible piece as a consultant

361
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,690
I am going to give to you that you will
share with her developers share with

362
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,940
their system admins share with their
software engineer is a system architects

363
00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:01,669
is the report the findings that we find
throughout the assessment when you're

364
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:08,039
looking for you know we're going through
the performance you wanna make sure this

365
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,960
property tail right you want a decent
description most things are pretty easy

366
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,899
we have some templates internally you
know what cross-site scripting is and

367
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:20,740
you know weak ciphers you know that
language is all pretty much standard

368
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,059
going through right you want to make
sure that the affected instances are

369
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:31,730
there what's the IP address what's the
parameters on what page is it there what

370
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,220
line of code has the issue you also want
to make sure that the vendor gives you

371
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,539
steps to reproduce so that you can then
go and verify if the vendors full of it

372
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:44,200
or not is this a real issue

373
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,789
you may also want screenshots which is
proof from the vendor that that issue

374
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:54,240
has actually existed right if there's no
screenshot in there what proof do they

375
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,779
have how can they say that's an issue

376
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:04,610
remediation that is a big one that is a
huge one for your developers and I would

377
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,210
encourage you guys to our consumers of
security when you're trying out new

378
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,740
vendors definitely get a sample report
from them everyone has their own we have

379
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,580
had ties reports for every one of our
offerings right companies should have

380
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,600
these things that you can look at what
their reports look like you wanna make

381
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,029
sure they're finding good things right
that's that's always a good thing or bad

382
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:29,899
things for you you don't want us to
fight him hit the thing that's always a

383
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:34,200
phone call Friday thing oh yeah we're
having a lot of fun that means I'm not

384
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,010
gonna have a lot of fun next week the
inverse relationship of security testing

385
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:46,190
but the remediation advice is really
what's important I have seen folks put

386
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,250
on remediation device will work with
vendor will work with developers to fix

387
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:57,039
issue what the hell is dat that's not
actionable that's horrible advice for

388
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,779
someone you know especially want to do
in Lake code level stuff like if we find

389
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:06,889
single injection and we know you're
using JSP Java using JSP we can give you

390
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:14,090
examples for what a proper privitize
currie looks like your vendors should do

391
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,059
that issue getting software security
OPSEC stuff back and there should be

392
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:24,440
actionable real contextual advice for
you guys get back to your developers and

393
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,919
have them fix the issues very very
important I'm gonna trade kind of

394
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,929
lightly here missus could go either way
depending upon your stance on this

395
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:38,279
report outcall

396
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:44,169
is personally and my least favorite part
of this I love writing the report cuz it

397
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:47,909
kinda like you know going back through
in documenting what you did you know

398
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:51,710
reliving the hacks for sure we get to
the right team stuff a curly braindump

399
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,299
how I stole your users passwords and how
we got into your building that's a

400
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:03,320
really fun exercise I i find to do but
the outcall the alcohol is we're not

401
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,929
that it's bad because we'll be
challenged by the client it's bad

402
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:13,539
because some clients have the process
where you have to have a report alcohol

403
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:21,089
and then you'll get on the call in read
through the report why why you had to

404
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:25,559
report for like a week you read it is
shared internally all your dance teams

405
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:30,960
are on it you're on the call come with a
fluid discussion I would much rather

406
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,119
have a fluid discussion to address your
exact points and get the call over with

407
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,230
not because I don't want to be on the
phone with you because our time is

408
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:45,200
valuable on those and trade I'm sucking
up an hour of your time your developers

409
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,490
time your lead near Leeds time and my
time and my leaves time to go through

410
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,230
this report and I've been a report
alcohol's where he was I read the whole

411
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,760
report and they said okay thank you and
hung up the phone like what is what was

412
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,520
the point of this you know come with
question did you have no questions don't

413
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,809
have the call but that's cool too I had
that some clients as well they've gone

414
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,450
no we understand the report we have no
questions

415
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,700
developers understand what they have to
do and if any issues will come back to

416
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:21,990
you guys said perfect great and I've had
other calls with clients where I get on

417
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,270
now that you have any questions aside I
really don't like it reads you like

418
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,230
you're my five-year-old kid I would
rather you know address your questions

419
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,700
that you have on your notepad casino to
have no training in know what issues

420
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,799
they're going to have with it and I'd
rather have that discussion is right up

421
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:41,700
front and get everything out of the way
you know you read the whole report and I

422
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,730
had a client I went through a whole
report I got 21

423
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,260
love finding and we don't think this is
a real find it like you don't care about

424
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,730
the highest the loans were you gonna
care about and he spent 15 minutes

425
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:01,109
arguing with me whether it was a real
issue or not the fix for the issue by

426
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,310
the way was just to update Apache so in
those 15 meant he could have just done

427
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,450
apt-get update and solve the issue but
no he decided to spend their time

428
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:17,200
arguing whether it was a real or not for
a low which was just a rough please

429
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:30,030
don't do that to us or do it and
challenged us at school just a low

430
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:37,950
findings but a lot of teams big
companies will have a timeline for when

431
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,980
issues how to effects in ohio State has
to be fixed very quickly within days or

432
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,810
weeks depending upon the severity of the
application and all that jazz mediums

433
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,770
are released within a month or so shitty
days thirty they Windows is what the

434
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,810
client end up doing in Lowes and that
being like the next release cycle right

435
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:02,560
so a lot of my arguments I have with
clients and if you are the consumers of

436
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,690
security here in probably that speaks to
you in some way you're going to argue

437
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,609
those highest down to a medium every
time you can write because you don't

438
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:16,130
want to have to go back and fix all
these things that we think is a high and

439
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,750
in some cases we will lower severity
I've done that plenty of times where it

440
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,960
turns out there was additional controls
on the back end that actually would

441
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,490
prevent a full blown issue with this
great cause we're looking for issues we

442
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:32,760
just have to prove it they exist and you
know in its low vacuum what its risk

443
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,300
rating could be to the application we
don't have all the insight into your app

444
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,340
in how the back and always works so
they'll go you know we actually have

445
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,490
like all these things that would prevent
that from actually happening

446
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:49,640
ok then will will lower it down to a
different story level we've done that

447
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,859
we've done that that will never take a
finding out of a report I had someone in

448
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:01,269
the middle of a tests found a whole
bunch of cross site scripting go back

449
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:06,690
the next day it's not they're going what
the hell happened someone was watching

450
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,589
what we were doing

451
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:14,170
saw that we were fighting issues and
then fixed it overnight to try and have

452
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:19,609
a good rapport luckily we screenshot
only find things so even though these

453
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:24,750
they fixed it that finding was still in
the report we market is closed right if

454
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,339
you and I had other instances where you
know high in critical findings are

455
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,819
reported a decline as soon as possible
so they can get a head start fixing

456
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:35,390
those things and then we shared the
report in there like we fix all these

457
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,349
things as they can we still found them
you know we're not gonna say we didn't

458
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:44,819
do any work in your app had no how no
high issues right there gonna be in

459
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:47,859
there will market is closed and put it
in his active some reason you're up

460
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,950
higher-ups know that we close those
things you close a thing which is good

461
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,420
right

462
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,799
find it closed it before it has even
over thats improve the good doctor allen

463
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,710
times but we're not gonna take it out

464
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:04,589
never think about double the points
remember when you're consuming security

465
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:09,400
services is that these are any
assessment is a point in time

466
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,650
review of your appt network or system
right we don't know what it was like

467
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,559
before we got there and we're not gonna
know what's gonna look like after we got

468
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,890
there and neither will you as you look
at it right are issues that we find are

469
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,380
found within that time within that time
period

470
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:36,430
and they only demonstrate how bad an
application is right this is Gary McGraw

471
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:42,470
our CTO famous writers block building
security here to build secure software

472
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:49,390
he calls this the badness matter right
when you have a pen test its not good or

473
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:56,200
bad it's we don't know or oh my god we
need to fix everything right

474
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,369
a pen test does not prove good it only
proves bad and so does SecureCode you

475
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:06,960
most you no point in time assessments
will justifying the bad things will find

476
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,970
some good things too I guess we could
say you have proper controls here and

477
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:10,460
there

478
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,950
these sorts of attacks were not possible
in the application or system which is

479
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:19,829
good to know but you don't truly know
how good the application is going to

480
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:21,150
apprentice

481
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:29,579
thank you guys for coming out ten
o'clock in the morning to hear me speak

482
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:36,390
I really appreciate it I will be around
all day so if you have questions wanna

483
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,940
chat

484
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,579
tell me I'm wrong I i love you have any
questions now I guess we got like 10

485
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:51,859
minutes or so

486
00:40:51,859 --> 00:41:00,230
yeah

487
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,760
yeah we've had that end classic example
of that happening is when we will do

488
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,859
like of honorable server version so we
know that their version of Apache is

489
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:17,500
like super old are likely find I S five
ever like fix that and then they like ok

490
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:23,880
we fixed it and we go and look back and
all they did was turn off the header so

491
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:32,160
we can't really tell that it's I S five
anymore or they're vulnerable and then

492
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,960
end in code as well we've had on trying
to think back right leg 2012 one

493
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,560
instance XO will give the scripting is
also really bad with this to rate so

494
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,190
we'll put it in and say you know you
have JavaScript in here is the payload

495
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,410
that we used so they would go back in
and I went to go testament to the

496
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,060
crosscutting was fixed and my first
payload wasn't working as I try another

497
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,820
one and the other one were to busy today
blacklisted by 12 no script alert one

498
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,220
hundred to make sure it doesn't go
through but not actually fixing the

499
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,850
output issues cause I can still get you
know I can tell with the responses back

500
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:15,900
that output encoding the brackets you
know it's not your not sixteen it even

501
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,109
though we gave you advice

502
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:29,670
fix it but yeah it happens not i mean as
much as we want to we can write in it

503
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,020
for the crosscutting example we can say
no you're still vulnerable to be this

504
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,690
this other thing worked and oh by the
way stop black listener one line and

505
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,700
actually fix the code right that's we
can do that with the software version if

506
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:46,369
we can actually prove it still I asked
we we have to close it because we can't

507
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:50,950
prove it still bad even though the Apple
has acted the same and a few dresses and

508
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:55,490
I doubt they spun up a new server
overnight to deploy this you know system

509
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:01,980
odds make sure everything worked out yet
the header is the class until it turns

510
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,700
off the header so we can actually tell
if it's tomorrow version

511
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:34,589
yeah yeah yeah that's a loaded question
my opinion is if you're afraid of it

512
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:41,720
breaking in production your app is
really broken asia's burn it anyway if

513
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,770
you're afraid if you're not gonna be
your server and production dude you got

514
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:53,050
problems right time we do end up testing
UAT energy to expose environment or in

515
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:59,200
internally in a dev environment that's
where it financially makes more sense to

516
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,470
do testing for especially AB stuff cuz
if we're finding the issues while

517
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,190
developers are still right in

518
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:11,030
there's 66 out there I have included in
the slide but it is significantly

519
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:16,630
cheaper to fix software issues in
development compared to when its

520
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:35,650
thousand in production right so you know
in the report alcohol in our agreements

521
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,180
that you know for testing in prod you
know we're going to try not to break

522
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,819
stuff but stuff can get broken right its
nature testing and if the difference

523
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:45,270
between us and like

524
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,570
known bad guy or an unknown bad guy is
they're paying us to do it right no one

525
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,790
wants to pay someone to take down there

526
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:57,950
they're banking system but that
enforcing what happens I had it had

527
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:03,700
actually happened twice and the first
issue actually a framework issue is what

528
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:11,510
they were using and that will kinda cool
well for me that much for them and

529
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,360
sometimes i fix it just like restarting
the box right to free up the server yeah

530
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,360
there were some weird like crypto issue
where if you made the crypto malformed

531
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,030
let the blob now formed what I was
trying to process it in the back and

532
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:29,860
that end up going in the loop cuz it
then have the proper try catch to make

533
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,750
sure it was it was not breaking it so
abysmally sucked up all the RAM

534
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,550
the backend process and it's already
rebooted but yeah we we try to tread

535
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,040
lightly i mean it happens and sometimes
the clients like we want you to test in

536
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,850
prod because if you can knock this thing
over we're gonna rip developers a new

537
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:58,870
one right

538
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,180
the flip side to that is to be new
security testing and something goes down

539
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:09,330
how much time do I have anything goes
down the taxes get blamed right away

540
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,800
right for my protection practitioners
who has been blamed for stuff that you

541
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,870
did it actually do when it goes down we
were doing a network ten tests for a

542
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:23,960
client and they call us up at the
weather systems went down overnight and

543
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:30,480
I wasn't testing 12 testing that night
but I woke up to seven missed calls

544
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,890
three voicemails and 22 email from the
client trying to get ahold of me

545
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,030
overnight as well their systems were
down and they couldn't prove whether or

546
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:45,150
not it was me which we give him our IP's
we test from no known IDs they had the

547
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,480
idea testing from their systems were
down and they could improve they were

548
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,250
trying to get ahold of me to see if it
was us or not and the guys email was I

549
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,230
find this unacceptable that we can't get
ahold your testers dude it's three

550
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:05,890
o'clock at night mostly I tell you when
I'm testing and then for the same client

551
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:11,020
their internal SharePoint were doing the
external network Pentastar unnecessary

552
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:19,310
items in their internal SharePoint
server went down and the email call or

553
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:25,520
stop in the SharePoint down is it you
and we were like ok internal what's the

554
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,390
IP address of that public facing and
then we'll see if it was in our scans

555
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:33,430
that we ran and they were like oh oh
yeah you're right there's

556
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:43,880
I'll let people go now I'll be around
all day

557
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,760
wonderful thanks for all the questions
they get
