1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
have service and technical difficulties
right so everybody's here for can you

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:19,920
match cloud right and I am so this is
going to be a slight rain talk the

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,039
reason that I wrote this was a
conversation I had here last year so I

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,650
had a conversation with a security
vendor but will go through a little bit

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,800
things here to give me about me for
those of you that don't know me by name

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,760
secure holy oh and could you please stop
talking cuz I can hear you up here thank

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,649
you I can be a jerk sometimes so that
doesn't know me I'm securely on Twitter

8
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,940
securely I dot com scarily or Gmail
anything like that I've been a naughty

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,350
professional since 98 doing security
since 2006 that are on the industry

10
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,600
little bit of done abstract now done
p.m. in the past I've always been a

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,340
fixture basically so I've always stay
blue team that's kind of where this

12
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,760
talking about oh a lot of money to fix
things

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,689
James Cole mostly boutonniere awesome so
vulnerability management is a is a big

14
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,850
blue team side of things it's the one
who tried to protect the assets from

15
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,420
getting hacked by the red team and
testers are bad guys I work as

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,619
application security now just kind of a
little bit like vulnerability management

17
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,540
he still do the scanning you still do
the remediation of vulnerabilities

18
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,619
things like that but this talk has
focused focused solely on the

19
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,420
vulnerability management for platforms
and things like that I can't say who I

20
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,890
work for you have to go through legal
and through a whole bunch of other

21
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,759
rigmarole just to say hey this is the
company I work for a few really wanna

22
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,330
know it took me there I'll tell you so
tell me what the cloud is

23
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,260
good answer actually that's what it is

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,330
there is no clout everybody on in the
cloud or we're moving to the cloud blah

25
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,860
blah blah it's another server it's
another rack of machine somewhere and

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,800
you just don't feel right time on it
you're basically looking to expand what

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,860
you're able to do with hardware you know
so there really is no cloud that

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,490
everybody got Microsoft's

29
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,370
which is a cloudy just their own service
centers basically orders so this talk

30
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,210
started out as a rant from last year
while I was walking the floor in the

31
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,520
vendor area last year I start speaking
to a security vendor that i personal use

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:41,720
hey what do you guys do for
vulnerability matter we don't wait what

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,510
we don't know yet we we don't do
vulnerability management in the cloud

34
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:54,120
were fine ok I just had an aneurysm that
that doesn't mean what you think it

35
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,060
means and I don't know why Amazon
handles everything for us we just we put

36
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,739
week starting server up we use
everything from that ok just because you

37
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:12,360
say you're in the cloud doesn't mean
that they take care of everything I

38
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,709
don't know this person was a sales
person I don't know if they're in

39
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,820
marketing I don't know if they were the
VP of I don't know shit about shit they

40
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,150
didn't know what was going on basically
I talked to a number of other people

41
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,350
that I knew that worked for that company
they did vulnerability management they

42
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,709
actually had a process they had tools
and scanners

43
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,769
the person I was talking to thankfully
was just not inform which is great but

44
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,810
it gave me an idea of a lot of people do
you think you know what just because I'm

45
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,090
in the cloud I'm safe I don't have to
worry about it somebody else is taken

46
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,680
care of it for me to do a little bit of
background so what is vulnerability

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,250
management and I'll take a stab at it

48
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,200
conference apparently vulnerability
management is basically a process by

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,530
which you identified this or discover
evaluate mediate or accept

50
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,470
vulnerabilities in your environment

51
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,590
operating systems platforms applications
whatever it may be

52
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,010
it doesn't matter where it's located if
it's a vulnerability is technically

53
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,760
within vulnerability management so your
application security people do it you're

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,530
operating security operations team does
it

55
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,410
same idea just different way of looking
at it he still scanners he still should

56
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,130
be doing penetration tests still should
be doing

57
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,630
policy compliance even when a lot of
people don't think about as part of an

58
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,930
early management but it is what a lot of
people think about vulnerability

59
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,070
management they think patches right
Microsoft patch Tuesday Adobe job of

60
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,200
that happening right hander and isn't
all that there is availability

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,810
management especially not when you go
out

62
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,190
also has Tuesday doesn't exist anymore
as Microsoft is releasing patches

63
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:01,950
whenever they are available now
unfortunately most of the time it's a

64
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,840
lot of matches you're looking at you not
only a platform OS but you're looking at

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,380
any middle where you installed you can
try applications that you were on if

66
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,229
their vendor supplied great you can get
patches in the vendor for not saying

67
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:20,419
you're looking to create your own more
most of the time companies are going to

68
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,890
have more than what they can handle so
they're gonna have to hire somebody just

69
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,510
too vulnerable a team and people are
going to forget about configuration

70
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,870
management that's another part of their
ability management so if you got no open

71
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,150
ports or default user names and
passwords services that you don't use

72
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,030
that are still turned on all kinds of
things that you know technically you

73
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,780
should be hurting your system that's
still a vulnerability if it can be used

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,590
so

75
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,670
what if you can't fix it you can't put a
patch on it you can't do a configuration

76
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:58,200
change to make it go away and you
mitigate it somehow some other way can

77
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,970
you put a firewall in front of it are
you looking to add a layer 7 Application

78
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,950
Firewall maybe it's even a V but you
want to reduce the attack service

79
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,700
basically only machines that need to be
there are what you should be running so

80
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,490
if you can't mitigate it you're looking
at risk acceptance this is also part of

81
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,570
vulnerability management a lot of people
don't think about these steps though

82
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,330
they think vulnerability management they
think patching had a person that I used

83
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,590
to train at my now old and / new company
when he first started vulnerability

84
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,030
management that's all he cared about I'm
gonna pass all the tens for Microsoft ok

85
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,890
and that's what I'm gonna work on why
that's what vulnerability management is

86
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,200
so you know getting that that message
out to people to say it's not just

87
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,290
patching brings them to the point where
they start looking at configuration

88
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,780
changes they start looking at
medications they start looking at risk

89
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,360
management risk acceptance process is
something that needs to be there you're

90
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,540
going to run into something on crammed
in the cloud

91
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,770
you're not going to be able to fix it
you're going to need to have some plan

92
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,350
in place some process by which you can
accept that risk at the correct level

93
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,670
you can have your you know searching
tell you we accept that risk is we can't

94
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,960
fix it or break application whatever
that may be a valid argument maybe yeah

95
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,020
your application will break if you put
this patch out but there needs to be a

96
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,770
process in place that the correct
acceptance level reviews it and signs

97
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,140
off on that person usually can't accept
the risk for the company so have a

98
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,580
process in place usually look at risk
management team things like that to help

99
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,190
that out

100
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:50,230
so when you move to the cloud what
changes in p.m. basically nothing really

101
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,900
changed your changing your Davis honor
you change you where where you're

102
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,730
actually running your system should
change your work what you need to patch

103
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,370
things like that when I start looking at
the cloud I really don't know a whole

104
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,610
lot about it I heard a lot of Hilo it's
like a mainframe here in time I you know

105
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,200
you tell him what are an excellent time
on the main you know the cloud on

106
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,960
whatever system it is just like the
thought is definitely not the main frame

107
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,860
as a side note that the tape drives up
here my dad worked on he's to fix those

108
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:29,090
right p.m. I've been in computers way to
on the mainframe is still on crammed you

109
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,780
still have complete control that
mainframe you may rent it from someplace

110
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:38,610
but it's on your site you do everything
you need to write their going back to it

111
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,849
the cloud is not a mainframe Amy still
have things that you need to do to the

112
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,840
cloud but you won't have it on your
gonna have it in somebody else's data

113
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,040
center cloud his expansion and
contraction when you need it you may

114
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,150
have some project comes up and says hey
you know what I need a hundred service

115
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,420
for this application ok great so you
call up Amazon called as you're ever

116
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,670
maybe we want two hundred servers you
know let's get an account set up to

117
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:16,240
start rolling through it you get all
your service out there ok now what once

118
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,220
you get to that you get your compute
power out there who's paying attention

119
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,470
to the risk just because you

120
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,970
have service they need now somebody may
sign off on the budget oh yeah great

121
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,240
you're going to put it on the cloud is
going to cost $100,000 a year

122
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,240
case on these guys sign up for that cost
makes sense

123
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,420
who signs off on the risk was evaluating
what you're running out there who's

124
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,250
looking at the images that you put out
there where are you getting the images

125
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:57,720
from is that your corporate standard so
he really thinks about that also does it

126
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,710
matter if it's just an hour to some
people may say oh we use the cloud for

127
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,480
testing something in a short-term basis
we only spent a server for a couple days

128
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:13,520
Davidson hour two hours away her dizzy
map that can scan the entire internet

129
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,590
and less than an hour so the short time
frame doesn't really hold water either

130
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,580
you're still going to have people
looking at your server as soon as it

131
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,290
comes up so you have to make sure that
you're looking at the risk to that

132
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:33,700
environment when you spend it up so can
you make someone else worry about the

133
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,800
problems when you guys are you looking
at moving to the cloud are looking at

134
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,590
doing vulnerability management in the
cloud

135
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,940
do you have to be the one to actually do
the risk management like the person who

136
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:53,130
was misinformed does Amazon does Azure
take all the responsibility on

137
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,190
themselves do they do the patching do
they do the the configuration management

138
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,490
are you even reviewing what they do a
lot of people aren't even gonna look at

139
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,780
it they're just saying oh so-and-so
handles it we don't care when she get a

140
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,230
little farther along in vulnerability
management you might start doing better

141
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,980
risk analysis where you might start
asking him hey what do you guys do you

142
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,760
scan your systems where to get the
images from who signs up for this is a

143
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,190
hardened configuration if you don't have
that you need to get to that point maybe

144
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,360
you're doing like an ON

145
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
as a Service everybody's heard as a
Service infrastructure-as-a-service

146
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,880
platform-as-a-service offers a service
you know it's a pretty easy way of

147
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,130
looking at how your cloud vendor works
you can start out you have your package

148
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,690
software on prime you handle everything
you buy the hardware you provide the

149
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,240
electricity used by the licenses
software if it goes down germany you

150
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,260
have to deal with all of our service
they handle the virtualization the

151
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,320
servers and networking that and then you
put whatever OSU on it and he built it

152
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,930
from there there's a certain cut-off
point for each one of where that

153
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,880
companies responsible and where you are
responsible as you go to your platform

154
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,980
as a service they may give you the OS a
lot of people think Platform as a

155
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,410
Service is the cloud because that's what
an ec2 is that's what you're as you're

156
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,410
usually is he running of the M in the
cloud its platform-as-a-service they're

157
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,180
giving you the OS and you do with it
what you want at that point you all the

158
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,589
way to software-as-a-service you end up
with we own everything we do everything

159
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:36,220
you have either web portal or an API we
will handle the rest of it that's

160
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,290
usually where people are thinking that
they're getting to the other levels

161
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,709
they're thinking all the patches being
done all the configurations are being

162
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:51,880
done on the other levels and they're not
so follow twitter and all three people

163
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,610
daily

164
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:02,180
yeah maybe a little bit about a year ago
there was a pretty what I thought was a

165
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:09,970
pretty good analogy for your cloud
infrastructure for pizza and actually

166
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,130
came out pretty good you start out with
your homemade pizza or you're on prime

167
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:19,300
you do everything for this year by the
material you put it together you cook it

168
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,209
you have the table to eat it with you
have the utensils you have to clean up

169
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:29,830
after your done it's all you that's what
you're on prime services are here

170
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:37,850
you're required to do all your discovery
4 p.m. perspective on your own you look

171
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,490
at your infrastructure as a service this
is just the hardware so you're renting

172
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,660
the processing power and the networking
and that but you have to put your own

173
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,810
operating system on it

174
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,970
correlation this is a frozen pizza by
the pizza they put the ingredients

175
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,850
together and everything but you have to
take it home yet to cook it you have to

176
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:03,860
have a place to eat it clean up after
things like that I was gonna ask for

177
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,340
water if you go to a
platform-as-a-service this is a little

178
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,530
bit different this is what a lot of
people think of on the cloud because

179
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:19,000
this is what Amazon ec2 do they're going
to look at having a don't provide you

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,910
the operating system will provide you
you know if you want a database server

181
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,080
they'll give that to you but they won't
have any sort of no skin in the game

182
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,060
from November respective it's not going
to be a role will take care of it up to

183
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:48,460
this point since you're putting you know
thanks will the applications and that on

184
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,410
this one

185
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,290
you're responsible for that point up you
got the hardware operating system you're

186
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,810
looking at a web server or something
that you still need to worry about

187
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:06,080
patching you still need to worry about
hurting like pizza discuss discovery

188
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,870
discussion this would be a delivery
service they're going to provide

189
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:16,990
everything except the police cheated and
finally it to your software as a service

190
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,450
that you're you know I'm gonna go to
Giordanos some people i couldnt Gino's

191
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,510
East Chicago persons

192
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,580
but they provide everything all the
power the hardware the software

193
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,080
everything top-to-bottom you just
connect to it or in this case eat it and

194
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,320
then pay for that service so if you

195
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,560
servers for our cloud perspective we're
going to have more taxes right everybody

196
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,970
remember having castles back in the day
in a motor on it right but as I can

197
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,130
relate to nowadays

198
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,680
thank you

199
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,900
coffee I see need to be awake so in our
castle you had everything behind the

200
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,640
castle walls yeah you know your treasure
your princess you locked in the shower

201
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,790
whatever it is we're trying to protect
was always in the castle to build a wall

202
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,670
you put a moat around eight but some
alligators in the moat whatever it was

203
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:21,520
unfortunately obviously we use more the
firewalls nowadays this is not hardening

204
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,970
your systems now this is not patching
your system's you can't just have the

205
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,800
you know the perimeter anymore doesn't
exist so you're gonna have to try and

206
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,200
figure out where the vulnerabilities are
in your Newcastle because most of the

207
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,580
time your firewall is going to look
something like this this is actually a

208
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,270
section of the Great Wall of China most
people don't think about that they see

209
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:50,100
the Great Wall of China I i walked in
from 6.6 points right but some of it

210
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,710
looks like that is it was hundreds of
miles long you can't keep up the whole

211
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,600
thing you're not going you're going to
have breaches in your defenses at some

212
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,050
point you have to account for so once
you do move to the cloud does that make

213
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,280
you bigger target when you're looking
for vulnerability management program are

214
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,939
you taking into account that you're now
out there on the internet here now

215
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,990
bigger target because you more servers
you do business in the internet if you

216
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,970
have a brick-and-mortar business and all
the only thing you have out there is an

217
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,829
informational website

218
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,920
chances are you probably don't have as
big a target on your back as somebody

219
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,610
like an Amazon or Ebay or something like
that that's got thousands and thousands

220
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,020
of servers and millions of customers
they're gonna have a lot harder time

221
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,420
than someone who's in your mom and pop
shop that has information website with

222
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,350
nothing on it

223
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,780
and just as a side on this one is a
remember the RSA breach couple years ago

224
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,400
but the tokens and everything the
security tokens that was supposedly

225
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,070
through a third party that's how they
got those tokens so just because you

226
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,770
don't do XYZ doesn't mean that there are
you for something they may use you as a

227
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:13,880
pivot point for something else if you
have more systems that means more

228
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,160
vulnerabilities right you have 10
servers that have 10 vulnerabilities

229
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,630
they're all the same vulnerabilities you
expand that 2000 servers right now have

230
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:31,789
$10,000 villages same image same
patching program same everything even if

231
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,179
you're right and as a service you're
still gonna have more servers or

232
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:39,470
Software as a Service is the only one
that's going to have the will take care

233
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,240
of everything until your print and web
portal like I said you're still going to

234
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,740
your vendor risk analysis to make sure
that they're doing their due-diligence

235
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,870
you may have some of your transferred
risk at that point but it still mad at

236
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:59,600
you if you lose your data if you lose
their data so having more systems and

237
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,970
having more vulnerabilities means you're
gonna have more configurations or

238
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:09,080
patches to apply for scans to do
everything you do for your on prime is

239
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,799
just extrapolated to a different network
center now so do you have the time money

240
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
and resources to tackle them all most
people are going to move to the cloud

241
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,440
just like they do their technical that
now so we'll fix it down the road

242
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,150
most people are going to take a look at
it we do this that means we have to have

243
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,559
more systems admits that means we have
to have more security people that means

244
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,159
we have to have more you know down the
line of every different job that handles

245
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,200
once around Prime is just gonna be the
same thing for the club you may have

246
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,940
something that handles the network side
for Amazon or as your something like

247
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,570
that but it's not going to be all we can
move to the cloud and it's gonna be so

248
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,049
much easier and I hear that time and
time again there's always going to be

249
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,919
easier using the cloud how we don't
worry about because they'll spend up a

250
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,559
server for us

251
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,899
once you do decide to move to the cloud
and you say hey and UVM in the cloud we

252
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:10,389
do it on prime we're good at this is
awesome did you meet all of our

253
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:15,509
abilities and if you look at the check
boxes there some looks like somebody

254
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:20,960
missed one may have any idea what that
could be

255
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:36,309
thank you this morning a lot of people
don't look at the framework they don't

256
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:39,700
think about it it's like oh yeah we're
running hypervisors and that's fine we

257
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,350
know will patch on the system's inside
of it he ever has boner realities as

258
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:50,299
well doesn't mean that it's RCE sorry
and the ability to only you know right

259
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:53,850
off the bat but doesn't mean that it's a
provide information pack something else

260
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:59,230
a lot of people do not look at their
hypervisors a look at our server here is

261
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,639
the most important source can then
that's it they really don't think about

262
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:11,090
every day all politically think about
management program

263
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,880
responsibility is it to resolve to
refine it on the ballot whose whose job

264
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,470
is it to fix it

265
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:28,340
ok so let's say you find it in a
surrender cloud was responsibility is to

266
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,360
fix it

267
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,790
dancers to look at your contract

268
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,370
unfortunately that that's what it boils
down to when you make a contract with a

269
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,730
company and they say hey we're going to
provide you this service that con-

270
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:51,470
tractions spell out what they're
responsible for it's absolutely you're

271
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,740
still looking to them to do their venue
that's where the vendor at risk analysis

272
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,250
comes in here still looking to them to
do their job but there's a line where

273
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,220
you have to make sure they do their job
or it's your job to do it and you have

274
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,640
to know where that line is you ask a lot
of people a lot of people that are in

275
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,870
the cloud

276
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:15,140
they don't have a clue and it said
honestly but it it really surprising

277
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,230
because a lot of people do the same
thing on prime you find a vulnerability

278
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,900
in Windows Server how many people have
had the conversation with Windows say no

279
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,160
no thats middleware

280
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:32,780
nope it's a Windows server that's not
mine it happens so what he did

281
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:39,230
idea one name in there you still want to
do your vulnerability management process

282
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,840
he still want to scan things you still
want to look at what's out there what

283
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,900
the configurations are wet patches are
missing 10 days are identified it's

284
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,500
still the same process what you may want
to start thinking about in the cloud vs

285
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,590
on prime know a lot of your cloud
providers one are going to ask you when

286
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,290
you want to scan if you want to scan for
GM's can you need to tell them when

287
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,230
you're going to scan they see it as an
attack they're going to need to know to

288
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,620
suppress that in their stock

289
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:24,200
them do setup authorized scanner so when
am I believe nasa's does well he do

290
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,210
we'll have some that you can set up a
scanner in their environment and run it

291
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,380
whenever you want

292
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,140
provided you running with the settings
that they tell you to run it with the

293
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:42,380
drive back to that is it runs as a p.m.
in your slot instance you're still

294
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,710
paying for it to paint a license for the
scanner you're paying for the time on

295
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,420
the cloud that's another cost a lot of
people don't think about all this and

296
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,500
this is what I was mentioned quotes does
have a scanner and you can see your

297
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,740
medium instance akashi 8.7 cents per
hour so a lot of people don't think

298
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,380
about it if you know I'm gonna spend up
this time to scan it I'm gonna run it

299
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,270
all the time

300
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:13,050
ok well if you want it all the time you
extrapolate that out to a year it starts

301
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,250
to add up is that party your budget or
do you want to just put it up

302
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:26,170
scan something back down again if you go
with the height of the CPU one c1 c1

303
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:34,670
high CPU its 13th so it's almost double
the price so the same ideas it still

304
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,720
within your budget environment you need
to scan do you want to scan and a couple

305
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,179
of boxes and say good or you wanna see
all the systems that are out there are

306
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:52,590
still gonna pay for the scanner license
for whatever reason so here's a couple

307
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,040
examples that I was able to come up with
a lot of people think of the name is on

308
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,990
the handle everything the patches this
is a brand new Ubuntu system that I spun

309
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:12,260
up on ec2 it had 10 Meg worth of updates
right out of the gate so even though you

310
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,970
think oh this is a brand new instance
that doesn't mean it's updated your

311
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,420
still gonna have to do a CCM Yahoo

312
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:24,360
whatever your patching system is going
to have choices going to be you still

313
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,060
need to purchase whatever your
configuration changes are going to be

314
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,750
there needs to be part of it you may
start to think you know what I want to

315
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,000
build my own instance I'm gonna put my
own instance up on ec2 which is valid

316
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,410
you can do that too but you want to make
sure you're you're looking at all the

317
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:45,920
configuration changes the patches you
know everything didn't fare so well this

318
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,000
is this is easy to as well

319
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,290
91 mag where the updates are you paying
for man with your cloud if you're paying

320
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,890
for bandwidth such a tally that up to
four how many patches you need to roll

321
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,780
out

322
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:09,020
thousand servers that adds up real quick

323
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:19,320
you can and it runs in the same issues
that you would think about what's

324
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,000
running through your scanner and that is
well you're still paying for the

325
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,850
processing power still paying for the
band with things like that whatever your

326
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:31,410
country that's right

327
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:39,320
yep yep absolutely so if it's something
we're paying for external man with that

328
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,590
would absolutely be my suggestion is to
stand up w susser SCCM inside your your

329
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:50,380
virtual cloud put it and allow your
assistance check in there is then you

330
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,940
will save a lot of money that way but if
you got one or two servers it's not

331
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,110
necessarily a cost many ladies a cost
benefit would be what you want to look

332
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:05,030
at so again this is pretty updated I
mean there's the updates that were

333
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:11,490
required should both of these on ec2
were both from just the last month was

334
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,020
horrible

335
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:18,509
that's a pretty updated image from
Amazon they do a pretty decent job

336
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:23,669
Azure has your automatically set to
install updates as a default for Windows

337
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:25,039
servers

338
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:35,599
that's great right baby tell me what's
wrong with this picture that's one

339
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:41,019
problem that's what I saw never checked
for updates

340
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:45,309
never installed updates I agree with the
idea that you never update on update

341
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,879
servers I'm thinking when I saw this to
begin with I was like yeah that's pretty

342
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:53,959
good now you mentioned that isn't such a
good idea I have seen yes tough go down

343
00:27:53,959 --> 00:28:00,139
for obviously that was my big things I
thought saying never mind that I could

344
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:03,969
check for updates

345
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:10,289
67 updates available that's quite a few
that's quite a few more than we run the

346
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,690
other one for me from Dec 24 was last
time they were flashes images goes back

347
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,899
to Hey Baby want to set your own image

348
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:21,569
maybe you want to have you here to
refresh image every month every quarter

349
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:26,869
there might be a better way of doing
this thing using Amazon's generic image

350
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:35,529
so I thought ok well we look at when
some of these updates one out this was

351
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:40,919
done in October this is a couple days
ago it had patches missing from July of

352
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:48,849
last year so as you may not be the best
one for the security industry as far as

353
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:54,089
updates and configuration changes so
obviously being you know a year and

354
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:57,099
three months out in three months

355
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:01,589
you might start looking at your your
image of what you're using for a

356
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:05,870
configuration baseline things like that

357
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,010
so what are you doing in the cloud

358
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:14,350
actually use the cloud as part of your
business what do you do with it

359
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,059
ok is that something that you do like
testing or is it your production systems

360
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:34,640
are ok so what else are backups ok so
like redundancy or just storage that's

361
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,460
one of the things that putting this
together I start to think about it like

362
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,080
okay well this is a lot of work only
really management is not a easy process

363
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:53,190
they do VMI's their daily job I keep
finding this I seem to be the only one

364
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:00,760
that hasn't like hey I wanted to vmi all
the time and never said it wasn't weird

365
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:08,360
so understanding what you're doing in
the cloud is huge

366
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,309
knowing the reason why you're using the
cloud is huge

367
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:16,980
a lot of people going on let's let's do
this in the club ok doesn't make sense

368
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,470
if you're going to be spending the time
doing p.m. in the cloud is that even

369
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,500
make sense to be in the club is this
something you would just end up a server

370
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,059
internally and be done with it we need
five servers ok why we're going to the

371
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:35,300
top 45 service but i dont Microcenter
grab a couple boxes on the network and a

372
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,220
story you doing

373
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,300
mining bickering it might make sense if
you are running your business like

374
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,290
Amazon or Ebay or somebody like that
then needs a lot of capacity because of

375
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,940
issues with your bandwidth or

376
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,450
peak times or something like that where
they need to speed up an instance that

377
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,800
can do something and then spin back down
as soon as the load is done that might

378
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:02,040
make sense but if you're you know using
to test code or something more than

379
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,480
likely just better off using the box
that you have sitting on the network

380
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,040
somewhere else if you're not gonna it
doesn't open into your exposure to

381
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,950
vulnerabilities that you would find in
most systems and you don't have to spend

382
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,770
the extra effort doing vulnerability
management in a totally separate space

383
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:27,210
and all the considerations that go along
with it so the big thing is that you

384
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,330
want to take away from this is does it
really matter is this something I really

385
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:37,670
am concerned about are we really
considering going to the cloud so how

386
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,780
critical is the cloud your business
program is a business continuity where

387
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,510
it's no redundancy out there is it
something where you know what we want to

388
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,030
make we want to get out of the the data
center business we want everything off

389
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,180
of our systems we want to hand this off
to somebody and have somebody else do it

390
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,310
ok then that's something that you want
to start taking into account that if

391
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:02,530
it's just going to the club because you
think it's a buzzword may not be the

392
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:09,580
best idea so going back to the talk that
I had with this person last year I

393
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,710
didn't sit down and talk to a couple of
people that were working they're like

394
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:18,420
yeah we are in Amazon yeah we do use
Qualys we go out and we scan every X

395
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:23,430
days we find the vulnerabilities and we
fix them just like we do from private

396
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:29,750
stuff so understanding that made me feel
a lot better since I use that product

397
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:35,620
campaign vs hey we don't do this at all
and you know Amazon handles it so it

398
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,560
made me feel a lot better but also
getting your people understand what the

399
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,470
cloud means is that a challenge as well
so when you do decide to go to the

400
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,370
cloudy so yeah this is a good idea for
us we're going to switch and go to the

401
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,440
cloud

402
00:32:50,440 --> 00:33:02,490
what's the best method to do you have
any idea what that some of my thought on

403
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:09,830
it is risk-based so every time you come
across a vulnerability and patch needed

404
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,529
I need to put another firewall in
whatever maybe you need to think about

405
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:19,820
what does this affect if it's out in the
cloud and externally facing a different

406
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,809
risk profiles then if your cloud is only
connected to the outside world through

407
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:41,929
VPN from your system that makes sense
and you really have to think about what

408
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:45,440
you're doing in the clouds that is the
big takeaway if you're using it to play

409
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,120
around with that's one thing if you're
putting customer data out there it's

410
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,470
quite a different profile so basically
if you have the time and resources to

411
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,730
devote to it and you have the ability to
do that risk management on the cloud it

412
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:05,929
might be a good good idea to do it if
not may not be so overall it's really

413
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:09,899
not that different than on prime you
still looking at servers in the cloud

414
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:16,609
isn't some magical space farm that you
just automatically protected you're

415
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:19,899
still going to identify if things are
important you still gonna look at what

416
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:22,970
the risk is to your data your customers
data and what your business processes

417
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:28,300
you still need to scan you still need to
evaluate it is still need to take into a

418
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:34,230
into account the cost of doing so so if
you're going to be skinnier and incur

419
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,619
costs for your scanner here and we doing
evaluation of the vulnerabilities you

420
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:41,990
incur costs of your security people
looking at them and then at the end of

421
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,669
the day at high risk to it if it doesn't
you know it's gonna cost me X dollars to

422
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,580
fix this but only X dollars advocates
breached

423
00:34:49,580 --> 00:35:01,600
had a real important 16 GB any questions
yet sometime last year

424
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:32,029
ok so how did you discover or use of the
cloud instances as Shadow I keep getting

425
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,980
around I T I have learned that my
current job there unfortunately is a lot

426
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,080
of shadow a key and it's a hey it takes
we have managed service models that

427
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,090
takes excellent time to speed up the
server and I think 65 days when they

428
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,410
take into account you know that storage
and who needs to be involved in sport

429
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,790
whatever it takes over two months to get
a service and there's a lot of company

430
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,520
are a lot of business units have gone to
that model of hail just use cloud

431
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,250
instances do it they were doing that
with Dropbox for a while we weren't

432
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,850
allowing it so you know obviously got
DLP involved in things like that but

433
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:10,410
from our perspective you really have to
understand what your network looks like

434
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,140
where people are connecting to if you
see a lot of data going out to Amazon to

435
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,750
Asher things like that it would
definitely be something I would have

436
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,300
your security operations center working
to worry that maybe it's you

437
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,220
unfortunately than you would have to
determine if that's something where you

438
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,360
are a lot of data is being passed off to
Azure which would account for someone

439
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,550
running some sort of service up there
then I would try and find out who its

440
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:38,730
assigned to what they're doing with it
if it's valid business process their

441
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,020
businesses and business to do business
there on business to be a security firm

442
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,220
usually so unfortunately you're going to
end up with you have to accept some risk

443
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,460
of what they want to do they still sound
the paychecks to the ATT site for the

444
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,000
most part some small security companies
obviously do security but I work for an

445
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,070
insurance company

446
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:02,290
our job is to sell insurance so the
insurance the vice president president

447
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:07,220
of Sharon insurance ID says we are going
to do this figure it out we have to

448
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,250
figure it out so once you've we would
find something like that

449
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,180
architecture need to get involved to
determine the safest way to do that but

450
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,200
yet you know have giving us access to
scan that instance which be one option

451
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,680
or did you move it back on her house and
get it setup correctly that answer your

452
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:51,440
question no I haven't actually have a
link to share no I haven't seen any

453
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,780
anything like that I would definitely be
interested in the question was having

454
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,720
seen anything and comparing on prime
chewed cloud in the security

455
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,710
vulnerabilities found in each
unfortunately no I haven't I would love

456
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,870
to see something like that because it
would be a great way to demonstrate to

457
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,500
people that IBM is still important p.m.
is still something you have to do when

458
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,110
you go to the cloud but unfortunately
have not for my test I've done with

459
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,790
spending my own instances I have seen
that the cloud seems to be from Amazon

460
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:22,220
perspective a little bit more patch then
in standing up a regular server and

461
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,230
patching everything yourself but
obviously as yours not quite that far

462
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,340
along so unfortunately no I have not I
apologize

463
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:41,930
ok

464
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:54,510
so

465
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:00,640
event last year there was a company that
came out presented to log management and

466
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,780
instant response and they showed the
stats between on prime and in the cloud

467
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,160
and the numbers are pretty close the
majority that difference be taken into

468
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,480
account with technical debt so when you
move into the cloud your thinking about

469
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,680
that and that lowers the risk for a
period of time but of course we're not

470
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,859
doing I'm vote going on about management
goes back up so if you look at work on

471
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:31,300
last year to see it in the in the last
two talk was posted as well so its

472
00:39:31,300 --> 00:40:06,799
management company they have some great
stepped on it

473
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:13,869
gold images may be in some of the issues
that brings up obviously going images

474
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,279
are awesome if you can keep him up
working as a consultant for a couple

475
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:21,299
years I've noticed that nobody really
does a good job with it most of the time

476
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:25,479
their images are at least six months of
the date and it's better than you know

477
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:31,929
lol obviously but the process of getting
that image updated is usually a little

478
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,939
bit more difficult and trying to get
them to do it even quarterly was a

479
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:40,130
struggle I did see one company that did
it on a monthly basis so they're they're

480
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,029
pretty proactive thus far as soon as the
patches went out they figure out how we

481
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:47,769
can apply this they automatically create
a new image anything past that point out

482
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:52,469
what the new image which is great but
larger enterprises usually have a couple

483
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:55,559
types of images that have two or three
types of desktops or whatever

484
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:59,529
applications are using as well as a
number sir images and getting all of

485
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:03,749
those updated is usually a full-time job
for at least one person so they have the

486
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:10,859
the resource allotment for that and yeah
it's great because it definitely does

487
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:16,209
help a lot of places also don't do
hardening either as like a add on to

488
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:21,979
that so your gold image should in case
you know your passions have gone out

489
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,939
what your hard-earned image looks like
so services on and off

490
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:31,130
ports turn on and off things like that
and it really doesn't unfortunately from

491
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,279
what I've seen it would be a great idea
its campaign this kind of thing but I

492
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:44,099
just haven't seen it practice and we
also thank everybody
