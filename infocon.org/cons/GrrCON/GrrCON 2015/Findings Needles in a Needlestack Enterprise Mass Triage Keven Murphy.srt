1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,670
my job involves going out to companies
and open number three teenage comments

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:22,619
malware overseen UTC my channel that's
very healthy cell and then OK and then

3
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:31,929
on top of that security recommendations
and helping them fix our apt problem all

4
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:39,370
today I'm gonna be talking about doing
mass triage so well this scenario say we

5
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,760
typically face and iris a team when we
go out somebody's company is they have a

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,230
huge network you know it's it's not
uncommon to see five thousand to 30,000

7
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:57,379
machines on the network and this
particular company gets notified by the

8
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:04,689
FBI saying they have potentially Petey
and so you know how do you handle it he

9
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:12,850
dont 330,000 machines and finding the
apt actors and then when you get to know

10
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,680
us from the FBI he maybe get one IP
address if you're lucky maybe it goes to

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,380
your proxy and then you're searching
laws and things of that nature so it

12
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,200
becomes a real search inside the network
figure out where the actors have the

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,979
other thing on top of that is is even if
you do get lucky and finds one of the

14
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:36,840
machines you then have all the other
machines that you have to take a look

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,549
for you have to identify those machines
that the actors touch and least see if

16
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:48,610
there's any tools there and the ex bill
and you know what the label on them to

17
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:55,840
be re-emerged or whatever the proper
procedures for that particular company

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,969
all in all it sounds like a big job but
it's not too bad so what we look at

19
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:10,080
triage is basically we're looking at
doing a quick announces to figure out

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,060
which machines require a deeper analysis
we wanna lightly touch every single

21
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,910
machine yeah we won't have a small
footprint because you know we don't want

22
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:28,000
to disturb evidence on the box we want
to keep it low key for our activities so

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,769
typically this is a management thing
where they don't want it getting out so

24
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,910
they may have been reached so they don't
even want the employees to know so it's

25
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,239
usually a core set of people so we have
to have tools and techniques they keep

26
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,180
it low key

27
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,620
the other thing is shut down the
business so we want them to be able to

28
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,769
keep you in everyday activities can be
the same calls at your management going

29
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:04,019
to have as keep producing whatever
product you produce and in some

30
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,870
situations depending on I was found in
May shut down part of the business so

31
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,790
it's a web company and we have to take
the web server off flying because of

32
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,660
what's found you know that's where those
situations but the biggest thing we're

33
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,639
trying to do with a triage

34
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,960
big games with little effort

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,270
many aspects of triage is and you'll
find us with particularly with

36
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,100
management is everybody wants answers
right away so it here and I are

37
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,940
investigator you're probably just
sitting down saying not your tools

38
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,490
getting into whatever logs and you have
some and died 10 minutes later comment

39
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:54,150
over and saying what you find so one of
the things that we're going to try to

40
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,830
answer what triage is the who what and
where and how is not gonna be all the

41
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,850
details but we're least gonna start
collecting machines and tools as we move

42
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,110
along and figure out which boxes for
affected we can start making their

43
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,320
timelines to answer the phone wats and
where and you know sometimes we'll get

44
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,180
lucky in figure out the initial how they
initially got into the network and

45
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,780
that's the house with the other
questions why answer is that we have

46
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:36,870
lateral movements and what tools were
ran the other thing that recommends

47
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,310
everybody is practice with your tool
sets as you have failed you know it's

48
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,060
you know get with your management say
hey we're gonna practices an area where

49
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,380
we have apt actor let's set up the tools
just run through a pro because the first

50
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,750
time it happens here gonna be behind the
ball and having that practice with the

51
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,270
toolset means you'll be able to respond
faster you all won't take down the

52
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,880
business because some things you may do
may end up shutting down servers

53
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,040
you know you don't intend to do it but
there was something weird with the tool

54
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,880
you seen that occasionally was some
calls out there and the other thing is

55
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:29,080
is you can figure out your methodology
that works best beer company

56
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:38,539
now one of the tools that much talked
about was you cap and this isn't really

57
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:43,860
advertisement I'm gonna talk briefly
about what you get is and then I'm going

58
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,199
to get into some advanced uses recap you
guys are really interested in checking

59
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,830
out the toll we do have free demos that
you can participate if you wanna stop by

60
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:04,310
the pool so he cat is a signature Les
and

61
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:13,610
option for an aging gets poured onto the
host machine is going to be the kernel

62
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:21,069
level so it's able to duty and
visibility and real-time alerting there

63
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:28,960
is no signatures associated with the cap
is not a antivirus product everything is

64
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,509
based on behavior

65
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:39,590
confirmed infections real quickly and we
do this by using weightless so when you

66
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:45,550
install the product you're going to
create a golden image white list all of

67
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,610
your known good binaries and things of
that nature and then as you use the

68
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,310
product you can subtract the known good
and what you have is no it doesn't mean

69
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:05,310
that everything is bad is just it's
unknown how so you have to take a look

70
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,980
and figure out if its path

71
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,920
basically how it works is we have the EK
server and like I said the agency every

72
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:27,070
single endpoints the agents are going to
talk to the gets her to get its new what

73
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,010
you want me to do you want me to ask can
you send your files things of that

74
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,740
nature

75
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,350
oh and here's the list of behavior that
I've seen by injuries running on the

76
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:45,220
machine and no point in the server
directly contact the agent so it's

77
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:57,130
always agent the server communication as
I said everything runs on the endpoints

78
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,480
we do support Windows and Mac was here
and basically we monitor all the

79
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,780
activity on the machine we don't apply
executables Bigelow's drivers and it's a

80
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:15,870
very low impact to the box itself the
only caveat I'm going to make to that is

81
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,350
that if you're in a virtual environments
there's some other things that you have

82
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,570
to take be aware of as you do

83
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:30,550
cannes is that you have to make sure
you're not over runner but its we have

84
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:38,450
directions and address those issues the
server itself is going to analyze the

85
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:44,340
data and gonna like families so
basically we have what we have I'll

86
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:51,360
she's basically its behavior based
learning methods and for example if he

87
00:08:51,360 --> 00:09:01,530
said process creates a job and then runs
a show you can create alert it's also

88
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,940
going to automatically download any
unknown file and that he gets her from

89
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:14,920
there you can take a look at the files
and determine you know it's good or bad

90
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:22,100
some the techniques he uses it has this
inspection and live memory analysis so

91
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,100
what we mean by that is if you're
running Adobe for example you uploaded

92
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,639
they are you opened up a PDF and that
video was a buffer overflow of some kind

93
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,260
and inserts a deal

94
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,829
executable in the memory he kept going
to detect that is gonna save that

95
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:52,860
malicious hold off the desk and uploaded
to the server then as Adobe Asrani one

96
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,889
of things but what it does for detecting
allowed his aspect compare what's on

97
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:05,100
disk versus what's in memory so what I
mean by that is a particular deal lol

98
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,810
thats let's say gets replaced I'm in
memory or gets how about what have you

99
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,220
he kept from the take that yellow memory
it's the one on this if they don't match

100
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:28,110
then there's gonna say hey this is we're
going to raise the road like the other

101
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:35,230
thing is that does to behavioral
monitoring so when a user clicks on

102
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:42,380
malicious email attachments the
attachment drops piece of malware and

103
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,220
them from their context of c2 he cast
can attract all that behavior associate

104
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,470
with those binders and it puts into a
database and this is one of the things

105
00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:02,720
that we used to identify malicious
behavior now this is a great you are

106
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,199
currently running he can get her
business so we have all this you have a

107
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:12,339
centralized point and it's real easy to
spot malware things of that nature but

108
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:20,260
in those scenarios where maybe your new
three cats or you have an apt thing that

109
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,680
just got no reply when I'm next uncover
some pants

110
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:32,040
uses for he actually read after this
fight one other thing is here's a

111
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:40,790
screenshot of the incident IOC's and
what this is is it takes the behaviour

112
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:47,600
in either that's been gathered into the
UK database and more less an SQL queries

113
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,670
against they're prepared to produce on
their meditate oh so with us for a thing

114
00:11:53,670 --> 00:12:00,250
as I have here on screen this particular
in the great backs hear what the Red

115
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:09,810
that is a remote at job behavior
detection and you can see it's a SQL

116
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,720
query you can write those all day if if
there's something that you're interested

117
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,220
in and the IOC's if you find something
with took their finery and you can

118
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,980
produce the behavior techniques and
things of that nature

119
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:35,550
you control that an answer to the IOC
database so windows trio using heat so

120
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,540
from here on out we're not going to see
too much more about weekend as far as

121
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,470
screenshots of things of that nature

122
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,950
1 I'm looking at here is doing advanced
texan methods using weekend as a helper

123
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:58,510
tool so I can't cover everything in the
time allotted so mostly covers some

124
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:05,760
things some things that will allow you
to protect cum laude and EPT and your

125
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,860
networks and allow you to start looking
at other boxes so some of the first

126
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,860
things are going to take a look at his
at jobs scheduled task task guttural

127
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:28,940
logs and the app cache have listed files
and directories there so

128
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,810
one of the things that he does
automatically is it parses all the jobs

129
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:41,550
so when it does it can get all the happy
stuff out the registry and puts into a

130
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:51,090
database hands using SQL this particular
example I am querying the database

131
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:56,320
correctly I'm not using the key can't
server or the 80 and what this is going

132
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,800
to do is bring back a table of all the
at jobs that's available in the database

133
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:11,720
so that's an example the query and down
below shows how to run it and this is

134
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:21,000
going to export this into a CBS file
then what I'm going to do is I'm going

135
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,940
to do some frequency and now houses the
child this is we're practicing with your

136
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,440
calls kind of comes in so when you start
taking a look at this pic long list of

137
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,040
jobs here gonna be able to determine hey
this is good I don't know what this is

138
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,580
and this is bad so in this particular
example using Linux just to help reduce

139
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,730
the number of things I'm gonna take a
look at so I'm gonna cut out the peels

140
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,010
I'm not interested in and then I'm going
to sort out I'm sorting it they start

141
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:03,850
for example awful though there have a
suit at 10 what have you

142
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:10,820
in alphabetical sort and then I want to
get a unique this is where my frequency

143
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:19,350
analysis so when I have 40,000 machines
I can restart reduced seen the known

144
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,600
good just based on frequency

145
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,310
apt staff and a touch all 40,000
machines they may touch twenty or thirty

146
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:34,080
boxes maybe a hundred at most when you
gonna start seen things when you take a

147
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,680
look at it this way

148
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,399
and let us or it one more time so it's
certainly not my number so that way it's

149
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,790
a little easier I want to look at the
number 101 of jobs are at the top as you

150
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,240
can see here the one where I have little
peaceable next to that is something I'm

151
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:04,910
going to keep as something that's the
rest of it you know looks normal the

152
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,779
network that this particular came from
wasn't super huge so but you can scan

153
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,000
assisi look at the bottom Adobe Flash
Player updater I have four counts of

154
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,310
those apts jobs or a top officials say
in it something I can just rule as it

155
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:34,140
looks so once I figured out what looks
or what I know was waitlisted I can

156
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,300
start using

157
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:42,760
removing the known good to make that
list smaller so that's example the then

158
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:50,040
known good just make that little smaller
make it a little easier to review and

159
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,910
the higher the comments like a certain
the less likely that's going to be bad

160
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:08,010
so so well as identifying a job so I'm
going to then want to request more

161
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:16,339
information about the particular edge
ups and get to that in just a little bit

162
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:25,199
when I move on to scuttle lots so within
the week one of the nice features I can

163
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,330
request files and directories I can do
that across every machine that has the

164
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,640
beaches and this particular case and
gain the schedule logs as I want to

165
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,080
parse those and do the same sort of
frequency analysis as I did with the at

166
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,390
Chavez here we have a screenshot 0

167
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:57,920
what it looks like to request files from
there I'm going to process these jobs

168
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:06,490
into more or less a list that I can
start reducing down to do the frequency

169
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,910
and Alice's I'm using the fine in the
end to for example 'cause i download all

170
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:18,000
those special crops and I need to run it
to hear this pro like basically that's

171
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,550
going to take the schedule of centerman
ASCII and then from there were up in all

172
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:31,560
certain lines from sex lives and saving
it all for the second step is I'm going

173
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:40,850
to cap that file and going to remove the
scuttle LG you sort it unique it and

174
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,550
then run the same process for frequency
analysis as you can see here at the

175
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:53,600
bottom I haven't that runs run Diallo 32
everything else is you know like the

176
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,640
Google updates the Ask Toolbar job that
is all pretty much normal wherever you

177
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,860
go but hopefully can start to see how is
picking out some of the oddness of this

178
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:14,540
that we're seeing the next step in the
process is months identified something

179
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:23,830
that's odd I can then search all my job
files for which one it was contained it

180
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:34,100
so that big long line there that's
that's been shown that is the name of

181
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,980
the file was downloaded from the box so
every every single machine will have

182
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,830
something similar will be slightly dif

183
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:57,880
pointed their that that's a shot 256 so
I can take that shot 256 go into the

184
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:05,070
download tab and then figure out which
box it was and it from there I started

185
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:14,039
diving into that box and figure out
what's going on with that job is the

186
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:20,039
same way he can't download all the
system hives I'm gonna run it through

187
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,169
Red River now one of things I did with
red rippers a made a small modification

188
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:32,880
to the app cache plugin and is going to
produce the output for the app cash and

189
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,889
a CSV format like to see their up from
there and do the same type of frequency

190
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:46,870
analysis as i've been talking about is
looking for a low numbers on file names

191
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,940
and places so this purple uggs PSVita
exe that was something we really found

192
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,340
and it was malicious the same thing for
the line below where it starts with

193
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:04,970
seven Windows deep of serious vida exe
was the same file just in two different

194
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:14,850
places and depending on where the apt
actors decided so as identifying files

195
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:21,889
and things I wanna take a look at I'm
going to go and figure out what the host

196
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:29,190
name of the machine is or do the same
sort of thing with the system as a deal

197
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:36,340
with the schedule logs and find that
shot 256 hash and then search download

198
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:45,580
or which box it was and then dive deeper
into the box just step 5 there you know

199
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,559
if you run to Red River on the system I
will tell you what the host name of the

200
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,200
machine is this all in that particular I

201
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,920
passcode rewards this is sort of the
same thing

202
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,660
frequency analysis and download all
these and then I'm going to process

203
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:11,880
those using one that can cause above it
and the only ones I really care about is

204
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:18,570
job I D one or two and 129 I wanna know
if there was a successful job board

205
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:26,770
there was created test so once I don't
those out and to a CSV file

206
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm going to set it up for frequency
analysis again and then start combing

207
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,820
through that as you can see here the
arrows that point to the left are just

208
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:46,410
names pass and things of that nature so
these are the things I want take a look

209
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:58,160
at so then you know I can go back and
then search this country lost identify

210
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,740
which Paola came from and then basically
like I did everything else I'm gonna

211
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,910
look at the dow little tab within yet
which machine it came from and then do

212
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:17,420
it cheaper to the other thing that's
worthwhile doing is downloading the

213
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:26,350
software high for Windows 2008 things
that nature because the tasks are stored

214
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:33,020
in the registry is no longer job so
they're saying sample the budget I made

215
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:44,530
a slight modification to it to show here
so in step 6 here I have wanted the task

216
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:51,430
of tools here and think I'm really
interested in is the action and it comes

217
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:56,710
out as finery with a budget with a
slight modifications to it the very

218
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,000
bottom line is I have the actual ASCII
there's going to so this is another

219
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,480
indication is something I need to take a
look

220
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,410
but you should but pointed me to this
was my my search here through the

221
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:23,040
schedule or Alive see the Task Name /
info here where says half is slashing

222
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:32,679
services additional snap and identifying
this bad probably what my next steps

223
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,669
after this is going to be is to get a
copy empty hotel mister investigating

224
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:48,750
the box so what we have so far is a
small list of data that looks like it's

225
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,940
going to be associated with boxes that
we're going to take a closer look at

226
00:24:51,940 --> 00:25:00,500
just to further go through this a little
bit each part of the medidata the edge

227
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:08,220
ups came from csv that created with
downloading of the SQL table for the

228
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:19,410
jobs I have data there from the schedule
G you that txt file and then he hands

229
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:24,980
you know you didn't catch it each time I
find a piece of data I want to correlate

230
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,250
it back to the ECAP determine which
machine that it came from and they do

231
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,260
this by taking the show

232
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:40,809
256 cash from the filename put into the
download tap for search and finding out

233
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:46,460
where that came from and then I'm going
to start diving into that box I was the

234
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,620
pools what the expo was what have you as
point out what happened she

235
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:59,910
and here's an example of that the 256
shot hash at the top

236
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:05,820
identified the file came from I can
right click on that line and identify

237
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:13,600
the box some of the next step someone to
have his conduct a full scan of the box

238
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,880
that you know boxes so I pretty much
took it let's say I have 20,000 machines

239
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,440
I've done this process I should be able
to narrow that down to a small handful

240
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,760
that's a hundred machines are so that
need to be taking a look at all of these

241
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,870
steps take hours not days so your
biggest long hill on this poll on the

242
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:42,270
10th is downloading that data so you
know you make the request for the data

243
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:49,870
to be downloaded as an files given an
hour to and during that time you can

244
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,179
take a look at pH ups like outlines by
the time you finish but that he should

245
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,240
have houses can start reviewing

246
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,490
adjustors cue and end up with scripts
and start doing frequency analysis it

247
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,210
all comes very quickly

248
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,360
the other thing with the full scan of
the machine is gonna take a look at the

249
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,240
empty there might be some additional
data there might be some deleted files

250
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:24,179
recover and take a look at the other
thing that he can't does do is does

251
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:32,950
allow for your signatures and I can
create my signatures in use of scanning

252
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,690
the other boxes as I find power

253
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:45,490
other steps that you can you can do this
frequency analysis you can apply it to

254
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,550
the AM cash or the recent file cash I
don't have time to go over those steps

255
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,890
but the technique should be the same
from or whatever you're interested in

256
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:06,510
taking a look at his picture you are
I'll see so this would be something as I

257
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:11,890
read my Yarra IOC rules are I'm sorry my
car signatures and then I read to

258
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:20,220
another scan I can quickly determine
which boxes have a hit and this may lead

259
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:28,550
to some additional boxes that I haven't
got to thank you for your time if you

260
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,590
guys are interested in some of the code
or copy of the presentation there's my

261
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,190
email address I'm more than happy to
share it all
