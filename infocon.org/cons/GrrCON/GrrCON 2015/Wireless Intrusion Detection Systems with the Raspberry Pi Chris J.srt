1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:28,000
ok and guides wireless it's really just
wifi will talk about that in second

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,300
normally when people say Wireless
playlist though they're talking about

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,700
wi-fi amateur radio personal so he talks
on northern I read the summary yes you

4
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,420
did I wrote us up last year for external
and it's actually out there on the web

5
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,860
sites got some in there if you follow me
on Twitter or volunteer training

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,160
understand when dressed like this after
all this is my twitter profile picture

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,440
from last year's Halloween costume and
when chris said hey we need a picture

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,010
for you for your schedule like here's
here's why they took it worked as a

9
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,699
professional looking in jerusalem

10
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:12,810
halloween costume your corporate hacker
picture it's like ok I'm awake at the

11
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,570
mask I have a BS in Information
Assurance from Eastern University

12
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,490
they're actually currently a grad
student at University of Maryland and

13
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:28,040
this constant texting very very hot so
anyways the guy behind the mask that's

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,330
me I got my OTP in 2010

15
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,250
realists pretty much since 1998

16
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,070
helped design college classes at the
college have done a lot of other things

17
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:46,490
and expect to incite a merging of
inspiratory less than 10 minutes

18
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,020
so going beyond that who also I used to
do research and testing for general

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,100
motors as a contractor the biggest issue
was I wanna make sure people were

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,320
hooking up their own access to the
network there is a big problem with with

21
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,569
p.m. because they have people there
while walking through the plan between

22
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,540
their office in the machine at work on
another access point and say well I'm

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,930
not gonna walk back and forth I'm
chairman my laptop with me

24
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,870
problems they also use the same wireless
network the same frequencies to control

25
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:28,390
the robots that the plants and I've got
a chance so that's that's that I just

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,870
checked out because now it's funny cuz
this was actually started as a grand

27
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,540
jury has one credit hour short of
graduation so this was a one credit hour

28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:47,250
directed study at university I don't see
Joe eastman in here is my advisor type

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,410
but during the researchers here so I can
get similar things larry is actually his

30
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,130
paper 42 Sands was fix all the problems
I was having ever built everything in

31
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,810
the restroom so he did it with the WR
cheese the old Linksys routers and

32
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,170
hearing all these weird issues and I go
there is paper

33
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,030
docking station there's a lot of people
have helped along the way to go as far

34
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:26,549
as to why were driving so are you here
hopefully like security tools that louis

35
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:36,520
vuitton with the logo is

36
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:50,380
gestures drug use a truck so as to be
plus gemcitabine thinkers gonna watch

37
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:57,290
Tron uprising disaster in the Gulf is
really popular they are you see the logo

38
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:04,950
on trance chessen first movie and in the
last week very briefly so I also liked

39
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,760
his replies are you liked this network's

40
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,250
so where you want your last chance for a
public security tools with was made to

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,730
go to build one going to other
regulations all the requirements all the

42
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,430
energy regulations government
regulations and PCI DSS is a regulation

43
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,340
because if you don't follow you can't
hear her please do business so it may

44
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,310
not be a government regulation but that
is an interesting one such as a

45
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:43,510
guideline PCI DSS cordless can I don't
like order this cancel call that a

46
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,930
second data loss prevention you know
what your IP walking out the door to the

47
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:55,930
parking lot and so we see in a siege
engine called the Car Talk earlier he's

48
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,720
like I don't know what the current
because of his agency would be talking

49
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,840
about medieval stuff and it's all the
cars gas and then policy compliance are

50
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,780
people expecting a premier without your
permission

51
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,700
you I'll show you where the scans
documentation you start off the new

52
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,570
company you want to watch their network
that doesn't just mean map your wires

53
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,550
that means

54
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,920
transfer problems turning off wifi will
usually do testing before they turned

55
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,740
off and if you search teams problems
when they're going to they're built in

56
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,230
hopes of stopping before they do the
replacement is going to come from the

57
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,670
same office park is you afterward and
say you're causing interference on my

58
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:44,340
such assistance channels they don't do
it early enough when they're in the

59
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,040
testing phase and say hey you're causing
problems were together to fix

60
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,550
interesting things let's see what's
interesting things guys to Nokia n900 in

61
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:03,780
bathroom ceiling tiles power charger
that was really hard life I had fled

62
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,500
into the word that way so it's like a
nice little choice but to be honest if

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,450
you go into more one of their session
beyond just just wifi you get smarter

64
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,630
tools that were talking the talk you can
start fining people broadcasting from

65
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:27,570
with and rebuilding other sites just to
find even more problems so like this one

66
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:34,030
contractor for for a while and I'm in my
department meeting agenda proxy proxies

67
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:42,940
like and he's like ok whatever nobody
else is what your problem is finally go

68
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,470
through phones like you are using your
phone as a hotspot that's good policy

69
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,520
well I got justice and i cant get to
work through the company goes ok so very

70
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,370
made in 10 turned on his proxy setup and
Roger so he set that up it's hard work I

71
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,860
don't get this is like a developer got
to have all your hooks in place for us

72
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,100
it doesn't hurt so as well as you are
scanning you know if I were caught the

73
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,470
guy doing the Dolphins hot spots her
husband to be over talk to you in favor

74
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,710
of his power without having spent three
weeks are working full-time for

75
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,070
snapshots of the reasons why I don't
like snapshots things like to move her

76
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,670
out they'd like to move around as you're
doing your snapshot and some general

77
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,460
motors we go to a plant we got to be
real about 10 of us

78
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,740
there's a logjam so we go around every
quarter you walk in and people working

79
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,400
for get to know us because that
engineers IEEE stuff chair the wifi

80
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,039
password he had 14 just left it wide
open so those guys get on certain that

81
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,509
to be like hey those I T guys with the
weird antennas are here again you might

82
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,720
want to do something about that

83
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:03,099
go over and shake that thing because I
party / stuff you know nothing engineer

84
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:09,440
the camera cuz I would take security
with people would get locked out of the

85
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,880
device in four different times in
Carmichael wants smashed from I said you

86
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,680
have been told no he bring about now
it's been destroyed if you do this again

87
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,090
as I can change my schedule and he just
looked at me like against you then I

88
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,709
guess I can cause your own policy I hate
heights they were sent out a plan to the

89
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:42,020
roof so you're gonna have to walk on
that edge and you don't usually have to

90
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,220
unclip 1.0 clipping and other funny
because you know you gotta go around the

91
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:52,240
device I don't like how it's also got
hit by one of those nice happy the

92
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,180
trolley cart that holds all the parts
from one machine to another one that's

93
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,950
open and left little scar and lastly
timing so you a snapshot at two o'clock

94
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,660
in the afternoon during or after 6:30
and might do I know what happened at 3

95
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,320
a.m. in the morning and we're also going
on the softest part besides I seen

96
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,320
business fall another guy down the
street using his office building as a

97
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,830
rave have been there done that

98
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,330
so respects the sock with that cuz

99
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:31,150
resume by Tues me so this is now version
to the first version has done a great

100
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,860
great great baby the beef prices came
out is a special projects like Manzana

101
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,000
46 of those desires politician

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,710
prices on you this time I could afford
that like wow this is great

103
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:51,740
are now in this must be better so skip
to be losses and straight to the 2012

104
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,540
plus my collection

105
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,910
TV links I like these cards I really
like these cars especially when using an

106
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:08,420
expression here because this car doesn't
require compile safaris grasp Ian arch

107
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:18,570
or any of the other just have to sit and
compile the card is so slow I can

108
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,230
compile things for Linux administrator

109
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,620
I don't like feeling when packages are
you done just downloading now the

110
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,820
downside to these carts there the ATL
and BTL 722 and the downside in

111
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,660
Scarsdale you have power you've got a
couple of options

112
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,860
the president pious don't do pov but you
can buy POS printers so it takes off the

113
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:53,230
POV fucking are you catch through
regular cable put the power to the park

114
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:01,100
for Cisco's big hit on walk

115
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:08,690
do 66 devices at Cisco equipment you've
got to go out and got to have a mobility

116
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,240
services engine that can either be a
physical appliance a card that plug into

117
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,210
your switch or it can be a virtual
appliance randomly boxes heal and

118
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,320
control work

119
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,420
so we're talking about $3,000 her
virtual in about four and a half were

120
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,350
physical right now we got that language
was another thousand at closing price

121
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:37,090
which I've lost you lots they get access
point in the first their accountants if

122
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:43,070
they do have some limitations but
they're great for persons house after I

123
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:50,550
justify spending that money is spent
about $35 by your party's starting at

124
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,240
mine and are $30 each

125
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,300
they're always on sale for something but
if you don't cost about $15 WN 722 on

126
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,900
our supplies the runs at the Rashtrapati
logos on them are 99999 industry go to

127
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:14,270
you and then $8 k so that will still
work with your right so far to build six

128
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,590
drones and that's what we call them as
well

129
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:24,120
his ps3 popeye for $100 at the door

130
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:32,570
the Cisco Cisco same six voices is going
to cost you less than $1,000 the fan who

131
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:38,960
you are is the wireless engineers at
ford said thats cool song on $20,000

132
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:46,870
from the ability engines not so what's
wrong I miss before Scott Kelly out a

133
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,080
history of of Kelly

134
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:57,850
pat pat capture and then again another
pass catcher know I really really love

135
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,330
kids don't get me wrong like a great guy
great work it just misses one featured

136
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:10,130
and we'll talk about that and second
mitchell also have 20 time for this so

137
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,050
welcome to resolve

138
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:19,450
will see a picture of all the minute but
this is what I actually presented to my

139
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:25,290
advisor for a great here's what we got

hitting up a society's dug into more I

142
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:43,700
want you to play a secure which is what
they used to do their taxes on Sat I've

143
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,100
got the secure wireless network
responsible for faculty most since then

144
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:56,680
the soft and that's fine I can cialis
real fast it's kinda hard to see cuz I

145
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,200
start talks on dark background with this
last couple of years seen by and I

146
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:08,149
foresaw ITC i three saw flashes her name
I devices for him because that's a 10

147
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:17,050
character hard set so yeah that's that
and he hasn't asked questions any point

148
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,209
is good sorry asking her to see so I
look at one of the network side I

149
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:33,370
drilled into it and this is where is not
failed me here I have real fast

150
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:51,620
hard to read this close to exotics mouse
but there was never an 86 TBM Ortiz

151
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,940
excuse me that tells me that it's a
native 86 power said this on me that

152
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,370
there's a big difference between you and
a little drone if you guys notice

153
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:06,520
there's actually four devices since
right now we're going to lie for

154
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:18,040
personal but that tells me that negative
40 p.m. which is great but where do you

155
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,700
host trying at least that's how much
possession find this is just like the

156
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:32,410
PowerRating of one device and you log
into one by one in this case re locked

157
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:46,589
onto the Society's I wanted in 1891 a
negative 71 and in classrooms 9459 so

158
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,500
that tells me is his closest to suffice

159
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,400
so how this work

160
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:08,100
picture that's that's where the
transcripts out of so-so where the old

161
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,560
building built in 1918 so far high
school campus is actually a lab in this

162
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,600
room here professor head the rogue
access point by the other lab and we

163
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,220
were able to figure out where it was by
using challenger so I missionary couple

164
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:36,770
warnings aircraft nice it's fun to use
but he need to be careful so every year

165
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:43,460
about the hotel chains were gonna find
recently got a night suggesting we also

166
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:51,330
reserve locking so what they're doing is
basically injecting to prevent you from

167
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,630
using your own device which is a
built-in feature to that Cisco device

168
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:05,060
here we do it manually through so the
actual relevant law is 47 USC USC USC

169
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,539
USC code subsection 3 33

170
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:16,479
and the main point is you don't want to
get caught and then you have chairman

171
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:21,919
saying consumers must get what they pay
for so I pay for fhe for the service you

172
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:29,989
can not blocked by service just because
you want me to jordan says he finds mary

173
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:35,549
was fined $6,000 back in October and
then actually last year she was summer

174
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:37,210
of last year

175
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,919
look at later on sort ce holding company
was fined $7,000 are you seeing those

176
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,409
numbers go up to you know I say a
holiday and last night that doesn't make

177
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:54,460
me a better for businesses who have
houses wifi we don't know yet cuz it's

178
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,859
not interesting I don't wanna

179
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:03,619
I don't have to find out what check and
see if she goes on she sit there and try

180
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:07,919
to take this off long as you see it
coming up here and you know that's

181
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:15,090
between you and make sure they know they
can get find a large numbers so idk the

182
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:23,909
gods among us talk for time so this not
talking 25 and 50% working this time and

183
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:32,019
I'm really testing it because I've got
to use bringing laptop and charger

184
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:36,919
Andy Carroll

185
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:44,419
chicken over so let's get this party the
speaker single

186
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:57,070
coats

187
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:29,730
ok so I've got his laid out throughout
the device can see change name not your

188
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:48,259
baby names have fun at school so I
switch over to IDE mode guess IDs

189
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,139
addresses

190
00:19:51,139 --> 00:20:03,440
phones for verizon mifi their respond
I'm actually not mine but let's look at

191
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,860
this one was less like this one
specifically so drawn to it there's a

192
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:20,409
school where he got the 1998 TV I'm done
here and this is what I can see so far I

193
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:28,429
can scroll down this route that runs
this year all i want i two or three or

194
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:34,309
four again the name that because you had
in the last seen by filled so everybody

195
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,560
sees it but back to the whole point

196
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:45,650
everybody sees it but I gotta make
society for in a guy max per average or

197
00:20:45,650 --> 00:21:01,770
1998 so see if this works fine

198
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:15,860
richard is hard to hold talk at the same
time cop sounds like it that's fine

199
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:37,450
size

200
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:56,559
and the workers are in the same bus it's
a little slow so it's true

201
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:53,019
audience asked questions now and later
it's there's more slides on that later

202
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:59,600
take this time to put you in now so as
to be smart about this over its word

203
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:18,830
very heart of your product as its next
month

204
00:23:18,830 --> 00:24:23,040
other things I kinda forgot its ok so

205
00:24:23,040 --> 00:26:29,430
sorry guys are we watching things are
for

206
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:52,600
so what is up here in the corner that's
why to they had the surgery innings into

207
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,530
stronger so I'm gonna head or certainly
for that device now you can use your

208
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:02,630
cell phone at that point using the tools
they have all their life which is way

209
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:08,990
better than walking off a laptop with a
narrative he knows he's done that or you

210
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,900
can walk around with something else I
don't have the hand scanner over his

211
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,160
reply now because it's more stealthy
anything which is

212
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:28,840
so I can do that with any BS SATA pick
up even the non broadcasting names cause

213
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,990
I'm still have the necessary it ever
have a society join them at work but

214
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:45,470
I'll still have its mechanism so that
this light where we're talking for the

215
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:54,350
purpose of this last seen how characters
including spaces that's hard set can be

216
00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:09,020
changed my feelings change if you can't
use the main screen you'll find what

217
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,810
you're looking for

218
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:17,220
so limitations last June by the network
of you doesn't you powering this Friday

219
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:26,320
devices just give you our readers rely
on those used by the show

220
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,590
Microsoft hardware limitation I love
this network card that works out the box

221
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:39,390
it doesn't do a it doesn't do you see it
only gets happen then so it's a

222
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:47,910
five-hour network you can see it and
know the cards that are currently based

223
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,780
on testing I've done in testing that
juror chaos Rick project is done we

224
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,340
haven't found any yet she working
separately but we haven't found any yet

225
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,470
they'll actually do both bandwidth at
the same time I can lock on the one side

226
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:09,950
or the other side but I can't do both
together there's no bluetooth in these

227
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,000
they've had a couple of amateur actors
able to hear in here and the sites we

228
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,170
got one general actually attack me
Realtek

229
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:26,830
so the exercise hang out with Marina
club like he had written on the same

230
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,570
frequency as like this church i've seen

231
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,700
nobody believed her words like not
according to the chart sightseeing and I

232
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,470
can't pick them up with wifi card so i
cant see Bluetooth

233
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,800
there are using the same frequency bands
but I can't see those because they're

234
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,860
just often nothing with israel has set
up a pickup salary so so why is it that

235
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:59,730
matter I can't catch a guy using his
blue 2004 I can't catch a guy brings the

236
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:07,770
reasons he office and open while a guy
using the software for data voice but I

237
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,680
can see his cell phone use his house so
if you've got the hotspot setup I can

238
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,760
see it if he's got other day so I think
that he brought the USB cable and plug

239
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,250
it into a cell phone but in that way I
can take that that's limitations of this

240
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:30,560
hardware system failures the raspberry
power source again Sorry Sorry failure

241
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:37,240
in the system the party before departure
use if you don't forget the trash so

242
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,100
they actually called him properly I have
to plan everything has to be financially

243
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:50,600
before you powerful device otherwise
restored your hard drive crashes six

244
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:58,870
that you have our hard work in the same
virus so you're in the shape of yourself

245
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,070
is also was a device's because all the
trappings persons who are the same way

246
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,490
if a plug and USB dongle with you it
does nothing for me because I'm still

247
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,100
fighting the bus if it's a larger church
environment

248
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,390
what's a cafeteria at large are among
the company's headquarters is your

249
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,289
presentation good luck talking about all
you can have such data and that you that

250
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:33,080
you'll never went back to the other side
so I might see I saw high 62 was sending

251
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,360
me all the data from other devices over
there I could actually a cessation to do

252
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,460
anything with it all again if you power
off the Raspberry Pi without proper shut

253
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:51,120
down here is corrupting are you sure its
own problems moving into the party's use

254
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,840
and Kelly 2.01 so what about when you
some fun Kelly no longer does interest

255
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,120
me card because they realize we're going
different sized cars I'm using sixteens

256
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,610
and just because you buy a car that says
a sixteen year but it doesn't mean 62

257
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,870
the car they bought were actually
fourteen to sixteen at the same minute

258
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,600
manufacturers to her as the ones that
have the 15.9 but their own fortune

259
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:36,950
organized and we're going to mess of
system do you like it so they tell you

260
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:43,840
to go proper file and at sea / for / ap
/ Marcio which is great if using the

261
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,799
system file system right here it doesn't
go see their calls that file searcher

262
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:58,539
stuff how is it that doesn't really work
on Cindy Cindy so-called that file but

263
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:04,410
it takes 20 seconds to run it kills it
so either have to put to sleep

264
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:14,100
or you have to go through and say it's
not quite working right and spend about

265
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:21,850
$20 trouble is killing it because it's
taking too long run but only seven trips

266
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:33,770
were canceled and then if we go back to
work is what's real fast

267
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:55,730
the bar on here as he channel airs

268
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:06,970
screen and see it says i cant such
channel 165 such a channel 161 those are

269
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:17,940
a chance that occurred in a second but I
can do the channels there so it's hard

270
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:29,919
work but if you block out the chalice on
that config

271
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:46,109
servicemarch Alastair here is ABC's
moscow is the Saudi Arabia channels so

272
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:52,799
it's picking up all the networks so than
36 which is your age you're at your

273
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:59,549
higher and it just doesn't see those I
come in this line out his parents are as

274
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:04,579
a control and I found that out last
night at about two o'clock in the

275
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:09,720
morning weather is making sure this
presentation work so I had time to tear

276
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:17,309
out why that is not fix it can't be
fixed if you want to play your own

277
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,359
suggestions cuz I do actually have
people contact me on a regular basis and

278
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,630
they say hey by Jordi Gola sure all we
want you something this is a proof of

279
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,680
concept at work

280
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:34,299
do it this way you use the same hardware
limitations use Kelechi 4.1

281
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:46,710
basis base install now it doesn't come
with her rescue program for Google to

282
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,690
expand your heart your drive to the base
R and saw her only

283
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:59,710
scripts and the scripts work there i
read your heart and because I'm a

284
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:08,380
programmer the these artists really ugly
shell scripts will soon as I can but

285
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:13,849
there's two in there is also called our
party with which is designed to expand

286
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:22,170
your drives as well maintained about
three years and was using RCA local 269

287
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:29,510
that is active installs the software
needed from Cali and pulls a file from

288
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,640
the W repositories install them for you
to tell you what changes you make your

289
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,210
own and then drops you into the
configuration

290
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:49,570
configured prone to ask you things as
you go along and seven times all the

291
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:55,500
configuration files for you to all the
senate for you and take your time

292
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:09,380
45 minutes to an hour to about 15 to 20
so it's fast so this one shining shows

293
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,810
were there is no network connection to
the outside world

294
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:23,050
so this is the the final configuration
file to transmit right so they will

295
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:33,430
likely start start out so

296
00:37:33,430 --> 00:38:32,410
so let's go into it before and can you
to it so this kit clone and then

297
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:50,690
you are a person file which is required
here it tells you is going to view and

298
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:56,340
download install happy about 5.1 who the
hell you're positive worries that goes

299
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:05,140
and does it start download press you can
download this file here perhaps arrested

300
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:17,870
for trial so if I say $30 alter happy
for you fill out because it does have

301
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:34,790
another connection somehow stories for
starting jobs you into change change

302
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,400
your filesystem

303
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,290
assault Kelly indexing stalls for
desktop mode so I'm at the larger role

304
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,060
but I like logs you into your desktop or
not but load you into an actual system

305
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:53,270
so I changed the file system and then
you are come down and change your desk

306
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,920
desktop scratch

307
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:07,980
you reboot your full-size heard

308
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:33,069
portion of it through some configuration
questions there are many but first I

309
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:37,650
need to go and staff and TV

310
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:45,299
funding is the very surprised don't know
the date and time you saw last time

311
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:50,770
required to actually keep updating the
date dealing with a laptop won't hurt

312
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,140
you add a comment on these are now they
don't think they're starting October

313
00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:02,750
that's right

314
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:12,790
questions about stuff everything sorry
your version of cameras in there to see

315
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,740
things in school by too fast

316
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:31,480
might go back and change those times I
don't always box with us updates

317
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:42,440
throughout the strong you are a
cholesterol raspy two years for a dress

318
00:41:42,440 --> 00:42:07,120
for mr marcus 48124 she for your mask

319
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:16,280
sort of these are deploying forgets this
is where what is it what do I tell the

320
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,410
kids would serve as what what's my
server ninja strong so that in this case

321
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:26,119
I for what mike hasn't sorry

322
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:34,940
by several cases 65

323
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,769
so at this point it's already created
for reclaiming our trials for her face

324
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:57,480
card so sorry skip static IP address
configuration files system to actually

325
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:10,319
start untrue and now it was no what's my
password and it goes through and change

326
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,339
your acct SSH keys because it was
covered with a tarp reconfigured and it

327
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:20,329
hasn't quite a lot that was intense
pressure to this photos to recreate CRC

328
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,870
he's received

329
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:28,670
and we're done you have a converter box
it'll be rooted device rebooting to grow

330
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:41,000
shouldn't do that and that's what they
want your toes if his hand you have to

331
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:52,600
worry about typos you have to worry
about center there's your file they're

332
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:58,320
all that for me it's only been tested so
I don't have to worry about issues

333
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,480
before that this doesn't like having a
number you call a drone and you learn it

334
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:10,260
normally like this one up here to start
of the user been kissed her own space

335
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:18,060
test test demonize system he doesn't
like that and it kills process we just

336
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,270
got hotter

337
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:32,120
working now so you can go away so she
took the time to tell the people they

338
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:40,970
are you guys have fun with it sounds
like now suggest they'd been told that

339
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:51,430
these were very surprised if they don't
work unless required to do the dräger

340
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:56,730
ever finishes production of these things
we do you get these devices who actually

341
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:07,350
pick up to the radio signals and do the
scanning devices and then her phone

342
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:12,230
again told that this website has replied
no this doesn't work on Raspberry Pi to

343
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,550
see what other frequencies like pick up
between thirty megahertz hand was ten

344
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:24,430
years or six years so tonight her
six-year hurts me way more radio

345
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,850
frequencies associated with this is wifi
not wireless that currently wireless

346
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:39,040
dealers to find contact info on my name
is outrageous I get home is serious

347
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,160
there's a long story behind that goes
back to IRC fight many many moons ago

348
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:51,180
when I rolled her at a store and buy six
companies on freenode you can find me as

349
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,260
radius and my blog write a lot of
talking about chains of ice is working

350
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:19,130
on the raspberry PI's is registered net

351
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:30,280
told us the best the main underlying
architecture there that's the main 2009

352
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,260
second I want to actually work through
it that with Jasmine which I've been

353
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,650
told it works but people told me that
doesn't work with raspberry Pi it's just

354
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:45,970
as there's not a power there so does it
work does not work I don't know and

355
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,910
that's where the question comes in and
that's where I'll see if I can I know

356
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,400
very large automotive company that
offered by the song because it's cheaper

357
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:22,690
and Cisco people ask me a lot times any
other questions

358
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:36,230
I don't

359
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:42,220
just took the opportunity section of
avenue to do so may go to that

360
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:53,290
ya gotta get six it was cos like shaping
of those and other questions so it is

361
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:58,040
one slide last night that didn't make it
to the final decade don't know why i got

362
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,510
clear eyes fixed on something else

363
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:03,780
a lot of people ask me about similar
immigration employees in the same so you

364
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,369
don't actually know you can go pretty
same instead I tried making this work

365
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:16,300
last night with alien vaults I couldn't
get started p.m. I don't know why I'm

366
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,500
not going to sit there and spend half
the night troubleshooting something

367
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,090
we've done it before and been too old
for that

368
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:29,350
pushing 40 so you have to offer that the
owners are behind me so stop aging don't

369
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:40,500
get old young girls over here he told
reporters actually has hooks into it so

370
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:51,400
if we go back to

371
00:48:51,400 --> 00:49:05,029
they'll pull the state into alien vote
for you so you gots immigration is

372
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:10,950
haven't done it yet but there's plenty
of documentation of the network that

373
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:16,339
every weekend
