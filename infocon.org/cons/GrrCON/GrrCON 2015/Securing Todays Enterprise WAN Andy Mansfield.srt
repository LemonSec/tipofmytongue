1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
from Juniper Networks I see it

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,060
specialize in the security line have
about 10 years managing networks freemen

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,550
is hosting provider just moved over to
Juniper recently so they asked me to

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,570
come out here and give a little talk one
of the things I did a lot in the past

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,119
was managed the enterprise when for big
small in all companies so good I talked

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,130
about a few of the things I'm gonna be a
little sales I'm sorry I think it

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,110
permission to do anything cool but where
do we go through this couple of new

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,180
products will talk about on the other
line so one of the things we all know is

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,760
that 54% of the data breaches are
happening to the servers that we manage

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,030
there's sixty percent of breaches took
weeks or months to discover so a lot of

11
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,760
hacking going out from all over the
place you know frequent every seven

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,549
minutes and all that jazz so a lot of
things we're gonna have to be careful of

13
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,070
nowadays especially cuz costing us all
money and cubans up at night and keeping

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,930
us busy and one thing I've noticed like
the server feel that everything is

15
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,320
pretty cyclical and regards to how winds
are managed used to be the old you know

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,700
everything stolen back to the remote
sites up to an MPLS cloud to a router

17
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,530
that strictly head over to the server so
there's no latency between a users and

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,799
the applications that are trying to get
at the only firewall was really between

19
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,780
the internet and those servers so there
was no real protection from the web

20
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,720
sites where people are bringing in their
laptops their phones all those other

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,710
things could be

22
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:52,950
already compromised and all of that in
addition to that cost of Appeal us lines

23
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,140
is getting more and more expensive
whereas local internet is much much

24
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,490
cheaper so I've seen a lot more
companies moving towards this model

25
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,530
where there's a local firewall at each
site that's kind of making decisions in

26
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,890
regards to what pat the date is going to
follow everybody's got a local like

27
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,720
Comcast or some sort of DSL line and
just following Internet traffic out

28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,660
there especially with the advent of
things like office 365 and all these

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,400
other things a lot of local internet is
happening so in addition to the one big

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,200
firewall that they're also placing
between a users and the servers now and

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,130
the Internet is also all those other
smaller firewalls and security devices

32
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,830
out of the edge sites and in addition to
the services they provide

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,170
guys like million maybe some of you guys
a whole lot more work to do in regards

34
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:50,920
to managing all these devices so one of
the things juniper spewed to is such a

35
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,640
management with Oscar director and space
which is our overall management platform

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:03,280
so one of the things in space does is it
makes it really easy to see if one

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,560
central panic last manage all your
devices you can apply profiles in

38
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,660
regards to that second slide show to the
network there's a certain set of

39
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,020
policies proposed again applied to every
site but you don't necessarily want to

40
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,070
have to manage them all individually so
what you can do is just set up a profile

41
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,510
and say every site gets this set of
policies on Maciel I got myself however

42
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:37,470
there are certain points that the most
dubious is helpful for just a declared

43
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:46,700
for letting us do the work for you so
it's another just view of the the rules

44
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,320
the other nice thing that they're adding
into it is we want to see beyond just

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,810
what size are using what kind of data
bandwidth we want to be able to see

46
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,830
who's using what applications whatever
cases using most of the pipe and most of

47
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:12,250
that's available through the CLI but
there's nothing beats a GUI for just

48
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,769
quick little died down i mean we're all
using sports and things like that now to

49
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,579
look at a loss as opposed to just

50
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:24,530
streaming the US islamic by Taylor
something like that so the central

51
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,750
management really helps with you know
the high-level inside all but different

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,939
uses that are going on in the way and so
you can be sure of what's going on and

53
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,509
how to make that happen

54
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,009
the other thing that's nice with the
central management is a threat map we

55
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,750
know that nothing gets color from South
Korea nothing good comes from China

56
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,310
Russia so being able to see the where
your treasure is coming from and be able

57
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,069
to hover over the region died down a
little bit deeper she was going on it's

58
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:04,270
pretty helpful for Maryland which have
the basic dashboard that has a lot of

59
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:10,080
different options for different users
over 38 which it's that you can set up

60
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,020
on your own personal dashboard to be
able to get the information that you

61
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,960
want at the front and then other nice
thing is much like a lot of the same

62
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,969
tools are used to moving towards this
goal representation of the event logs

63
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:30,520
there's a time span selector you can die
down in by clicking on the different

64
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,740
sites obviously the the different
utilizations open 24 colors that you

65
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,740
really make it stand out for you

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,259
can check out the trends in the
aggregation drill down and as I was

67
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:51,080
saying it and then the different
European countries flags and the ability

68
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,080
to just do some pics heading so that's
just a real high level overview of what

69
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,789
we're doing at the center management of
layers of security so I know everybody

70
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:08,069
thinks of Juniper as the backbone of the
internet and we were pretty strong

71
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,750
market but my own personal opinion I
know the SRX has taken some hits back in

72
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,210
the day but they're definitely moved a
whole lot of improvement into that line

73
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,310
with the spinning off also oppose
product everybody's dole on the SRX the

74
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,870
advances that come through if it had
been pretty nice so along with the with

75
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,789
advice piano

76
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,819
really popular high-end router with
everything up to and including MPLS

77
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:39,419
layer 7 inspection and ancillary
security services it's it's pretty much

78
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,830
an all-in-one toolbox so everything from
the abstract to see which applications

79
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,530
being used to the apt firewall which is
pretty nice instead of just saying hey

80
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,960
port 80 is blocked are open we can say
Facebook post isn't cool but you to

81
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,820
washing is being able to throttle the
applications based on what they are

82
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,310
supposed to just the port is nice but
the two that I'm really going to focus

83
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,710
on more out today is the IPS

84
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,360
more the to the UTM security
intelligence guy advanced threat

85
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,849
protection and as a proxy which is

86
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,199
an extremely nice functionality and
regards to be able to take a look into

87
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:32,770
the into the encrypted such as it goes
through the device so basically what

88
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,860
this is just an overview of the packet
paths throughout the ranks as its diving

89
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,309
and so you get all your basics no
screens which is basically to security

90
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:50,259
through the Nats and all the others on
what we have as we've been with the

91
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:56,979
application identification which is
helping us to enable deeper control over

92
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:03,689
what's going on our networks so I'm just
going to get through this just exactly

93
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:09,589
where it goes but and that last up their
of the services that's where we hit that

94
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:16,999
full suite of advanced security
functionality and now this is a basic

95
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:24,029
flow chart that shows how the app idea
works so it's gonna do a full check

96
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,789
through the entire packet and make sure
that it does everything I can to

97
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:33,180
identify the actual application and it's
not going to let television techniques

98
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,279
so it's going through the ICMP person
clearly it tries to identify targets

99
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,389
that what's not ICMP its gonna go
through other no protocols and died down

100
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:48,300
deep in so what the slides really
showing is that we're going to dig deep

101
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,990
in make sure we know what we're dealing
with this just shows an overall

102
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,829
screenshot from space and security
director of that kind of shows the

103
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,689
options are available with the app for a
while now I P S

104
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,250
so as you can see it's not just sayin
HTTP year

105
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,380
ltp it's actually diving into this show
and it's gonna be connected or you know

106
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,590
don't front-runner no sales department
uses that quite frankly most most

107
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,560
offices but the more important thing
that we're dealing with is the SSL proxy

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,620
so what you'll see is if it's a knockout
connection from a user to the Internet

109
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,020
the SRX will actually intercept that SSL
connection and for remembering the

110
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,070
middle so decrypt between the user and
the SRX look through the packet

111
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,630
Krypton complete the connection out to
the server that way it gets

112
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,790
actual deep insight into what's going on
so there's no tunneling over us all that

113
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,490
you know you can quickly evade most
other products and that also on the way

114
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,390
back in its gonna do the same thing so
if you have a web server behind the SRX

115
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,890
thats hosting and web page is gonna go
ahead and load the search for acts

116
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,970
decrypt inspect pass along and we're
just gonna make sure that that nothing

117
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:19,250
bad so one thing that Jennifer does it
kinda leverages us from the competition

118
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,690
as we have a dedicated team that's up to
you

119
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:29,190
researching the vulnerabilities in the
emerging threats clearly we're we're in

120
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,860
the industry-leading response time due
to our release signature updates daily

121
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,750
even down to the hours and minutes for
emergencies and we also have an open

122
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:47,420
signature database through the use cases
that we all have seen before and that we

123
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,440
know about

124
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,140
so we've got the server protection which
you know it from the internet down into

125
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,690
the server we've got the car protection
which is attributed to bring your

126
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,090
laptops into the office now right you
don't know what they picked up at home

127
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,160
to bring into your networks protecting
the users of the Service from your users

128
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,810
also and then on top of that we've got
just user-to-user internal what's hacks

129
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:20,430
that we're keeping an eye out for so
when we're dealing with the IPS there is

130
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,090
a ridiculous amount of signatures out
there that none of us want to manage my

131
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:32,850
hands and what the space does it kind of
makes it easy because we can sort by

132
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:39,640
groups bday applications category
severity then what are really nice

133
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,560
features as recommended which is
somebody else's make the decisions as to

134
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,830
what they think you need to act against
and what you might not need to because

135
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,150
that's a couple of full-time jobs in and
of itself of understanding what's

136
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,030
actually a threat was a false positive
was a real positive move on from there

137
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:05,950
another search functionality that we
have as by keyword CPUID which has been

138
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,020
quite hopeful for me in the past
customer looking around on the internet

139
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,480
get a report of a this blogs out there
are you protected and I can just go and

140
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,440
search by that bug free donuts protected
and that also part but track which is a

141
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,050
nice one

142
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:26,240
the other thing is we have the open
attack database so the attack surrender

143
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,350
protect against the dollar abilities
rather than an exploit which means it is

144
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,400
harder like the LIC or something along
those lines so instead of trying to

145
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,830
identify the actual script is being run
we're going to look at how the

146
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,350
vulnerability is functioning and protect
against any tool that's attacking that

147
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,190
as opposed to a specific tool

148
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:54,550
now the other nice thing in the
differentiation between us a lot of

149
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:02,240
other IPS devices out there is you don't
have to run through all connections just

150
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,970
to focus on specific attacks right so
with that being later in here with the

151
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,800
with the firewall policies and so as
packets running through the ear

152
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,730
protection algorithm gonna hit a policy
in its only being called if it's an HTTP

153
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,330
HTTP or HTTPS and that's what we're
gonna look for the the Facebook and

154
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,460
YouTube and things like that not
necessarily on other ones but that's all

155
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,600
up to the individual network admin to go
ahead and make their decisions as to how

156
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,320
they want to apply it but it definitely
makes it easy for us and the real nice

157
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,760
thing especially for a lot of guys out
there is we have the ability to pull

158
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:49,420
your caps for analysis after the fact so
far device recognizes an attack is

159
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,500
happening you can go ahead and set it up
to pull a pcap and set it off to you so

160
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:01,400
you can let the rainy forensics around
and there's clearly those tools

161
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,220
available

162
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,620
UTM architecture is pretty

163
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:15,390
pretty simple and regards to and I virus
anti spam web filtering you guys all of

164
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:22,400
this words the enhanced web filtering
chance to show he is gonna go through

165
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,220
the engine of identifying based on
either URL or activity

166
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:39,580
the new anti malware is its purpose
built its devices regards to its looking

167
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,470
more for attacks on individual computers
as opposed to surfers things along those

168
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:51,610
lines but to the devices products that
are really wonderful talk about so the

169
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,870
security intelligence it's a platform
that connects a whole lot of ideas

170
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,170
together so we got space as a central
management platform with security

171
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:09,110
director and the SRX doing the work but
there's also a p.m. that runs that's

172
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:16,430
called second Tyler the spotlight
connector and what it does is it at

173
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,950
times everything together what it boils
down to is there's a spotlight secure

174
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:29,170
service that runs in the cloud and that
reaches out to the connector the

175
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,279
connectors kind of the central point of
between security director of the SRX the

176
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:42,490
user at men's spotlight secure and what
this does is we all know that there's a

177
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,490
list of

178
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:50,680
known bad guys out there for a better
way to say and what the connector does

179
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,260
it it pulls from multiple different
lists of command control servers from

180
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:02,170
GeoIP lists then you can also do custom
black and white lists and buttoned

181
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,440
really nice thing is this happens every
15 10 to 15 seconds

182
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,770
the so the firewall is making the
decisions as to if it's blocked or not

183
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,980
the connector is pulling all the
information together

184
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,370
directors where you manage it from
spotlights curious the cloud-based

185
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:29,430
service that's a third-party kind of
your own additional security department

186
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,010
that's out there identifying threats and
things along those lines

187
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:39,440
overview of how it all works is right
here where the connectors bullying and

188
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,220
from spotlights carefully API feats and
that's something I should dive into so

189
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,459
all of these things combined is what we
put in the box for you but along the

190
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:57,029
lines of everything that juniper does
there is an open API so you can write

191
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,160
your own scripts to go out and poll for
me all sources and push in the different

192
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:10,270
rules as you want and in regards to the
the enterprise way and why this is nice

193
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:15,550
is let's say that you find that there
was specific site that's attacking one

194
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,770
location you go ahead and update just
the the connector connector push this

195
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,980
out too although individual firewalls
immediately on their own without a

196
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,580
permit or without any real config
changes it's a real time push it out and

197
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,250
all those other sites are protected from
that one attacker that you're aware of

198
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:44,400
so as I was just said the haps without
permits and the second toe receives the

199
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,410
dynamics feeds from all the different
sources that we've spoken off from the

200
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:56,320
cloud from your own lists and it's
continuously updated with a full team of

201
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,720
people 24 7 getting those lists
populated

202
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,770
the platform itself gives us the
flexibility to add your own information

203
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,610
as well as saying even through the API
is the white list or through the

204
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:23,910
connected itself and so I'd love to be
able to give you the list of where we're

205
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:29,660
getting that information from however
its potential for multiple reasons but

206
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:37,080
there is a full security suite people
and organizations out there feeding us

207
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,700
information and one of those one of
those sources as well be getting to a

208
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
minute

209
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:53,059
different application that we're going
to be putting into here

210
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:59,110
so custom black and white letters you
can do

211
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,820
CSV format of lists which is pretty nice
for having one department right hand

212
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,240
keeping track of what's good and what's
bad platform you're seeing you can get

213
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,779
up from that and really push the limits
as to how you're going to pull this with

214
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:22,929
the API cuz you can take the information
from anywhere and really give a list of

215
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:32,480
what's bad was good from the use cases
are gonna be pretty pretty simple in

216
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:40,740
regards to the the user protection so
one of the main things that we're always

217
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,639
looking for especially with the remote
users on a surprise when our command

218
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:49,970
control those so what will happen is
because your device at home

219
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,249
pick up some some going to wear
something like that and the number one

220
00:19:55,249 --> 00:20:00,480
indicator that is reaching back out to a
botnet commitment rolled out so we're

221
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,009
keeping a list of those together and
that's the number one list of things are

222
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:11,360
devices that will identify as being bad
and

223
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,160
clearly we put it all back through the
control node and CD rules as we go along

224
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:27,940
we can pull this in from an existing
rapper IDs so it doesn't have to be

225
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,850
necessarily Jennifer here and its all
time together in that regard one of the

226
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:40,490
other nice things that this can do is
not just identify remote devices that

227
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:48,169
are bad but once we do see that device
internally is inspected it can update

228
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,830
your firewall rules to block that user
for reaching anything also support even

229
00:20:51,830 --> 00:21:00,880
just anything on the outside world time
zone trying to get up to get all of this

230
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:11,720
alright so this is the other platform
that is going to really help us feed

231
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,850
into the list of I'm going to keep all
the bad guys because it's easy to say is

232
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:24,730
the sky advanced threat protection what
guy for protection is it's beyond

233
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,559
typical intrusion detection

234
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:33,760
a little bit ago juniper particle called
Mykonos and their big thing was as

235
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,030
opposed to intrusion prevention and
detection but deception and what it will

236
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,750
do

237
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:46,810
is is a chain of techniques that we put
together to collect information so

238
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:54,280
instead of just blocking an attack and
putting that aside having the attacker

239
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,490
just change their tactics what is gonna
do is gonna follow amounts to a sandbox

240
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:09,560
and it's going to keep it on

241
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,810
deeper given a more and more things to
try to attack that we can further

242
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:21,510
fingerprint them and add them to our
list of known offenders and the thing

243
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,520
that's nice about that is it's off to
the side it gets pushed up through a

244
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:34,370
whole 24 cloud service it's unknown if
the attacker and it just keeps them busy

245
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,480
as opposed to block in it and also
allows us to identify and fingerprint

246
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,640
the new tools in attacks as they come

247
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:49,570
the other thing that this does is it
caches the lookups so they can be

248
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:55,580
completed in under two minutes there's a
series of AV engines that run up in the

249
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:03,120
cloud also so generally known fiery and
Mallory be identified under 10 seconds

250
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,700
then there's a static analysis but what
really really sets us apart is the

251
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:16,490
ability to recognize unknown 0 day
attacks and begin to finger print them

252
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,340
and add them into our list of known
attacks by using machine learning it to

253
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:29,460
really do the the isolation of attackers
and attacks

254
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,130
so the first thing that happens is the
attack will come through

255
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:40,149
detect for cash instead of static
analysis and if it's blocked nice if not

256
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:46,100
can keep going on to the dynamic
announces from there there's that's

257
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,460
business stuff and then it also pushes
back into that that spotlight secure

258
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,429
system that I was speaking of or with
the fullest of RD no command control in

259
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:04,200
your IP customer lists along those lines
and it's going to continue sandboxing it

260
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:12,720
and using the remote analytics to
identify what's going on that I really

261
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,080
want to get to perform gotta go so one
of the really nice things have happened

262
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,000
with the advanced threat protection is
before it lets you download complete is

263
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,230
the SRX identifies it as being a
malicious file it's going to hold the

264
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,770
last few packets so the device and
computer never actually receives the

265
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,640
full package that so it can't really be
infected

266
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,240
the other thing that's nice is there's
always that fine line between security

267
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,350
and functionality so there's a tunable
function for if it's gonna take a little

268
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,750
bit too long it'll go ahead and let the
demo go through but I still continue

269
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,960
processing it and identifying what's bad
and alert your engineers so they can go

270
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:09,450
investigate the device later and then
finds that the download the weather was

271
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,840
bad it will go ahead and block traffic
from that site source or that file for

272
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:22,640
future uses so

273
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,010
I mean we get all this together so
instead of going out further that

274
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,820
anybody have any questions and I ran
through a whole bunch real quick a lot

275
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:44,179
of her before but is there anything else

276
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:55,250
built-in functionality for bringing in
new list she said

277
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:05,480
so anything is going to be falling
through the firewall or the SRX with the

278
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,450
center pipe actually watching that you
can use all the API hooks for any and

279
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,710
all information that you want so I knew
I P comes to have a new Mac comes

280
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:19,060
through you can go and write a script up
all that in a bit populate the bad guy

281
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:26,910
list them sorry yes I think outside of
the hand no more

282
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,630
well I've also been asked to invite you
all to go by the Great Lakes computer

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,540
booth they're giving away a drone I have
to stop by and sign up for an hour and

284
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,940
then there's an after party tonight at
the Bob from six to nine third floor so

285
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,120
the bar for some drinks and food and
have some fun
