1
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:46,980
it's done sorry I'm not gonna get my
notes I guess here already how's it

2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:56,760
going how are you enjoying hangover day
and there's only half the audience here

3
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,920
at least I didn't have to give my talk
like eight o'clock in the morning so

4
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,760
alright so my name's Amanda I'm here to
talk about fishing program that I put in

5
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,170
place a hospital they worked up I was
there for seven years and we had a

6
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,000
pretty good infrastructure already in
the program that we put together I'm

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,460
gonna go over how we put together some
of the stuff that I learned some of the

8
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,580
stuff that I do different the metrics
that we tracked and how well we did over

9
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:41,399
time so that's me Mr online so I did
purple team for a while I was a Windows

10
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:50,119
admin yay did a lot of server
actor-director Group Policy anything

11
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,300
when those name and I mean exchange we
were kind of a toss pillows that it was

12
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,050
a kind of a one-stop shop when I came to
our network a list so we did everything

13
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,929
but for storage to networking security
whatever I did the fishing team and then

14
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:16,830
I'm currently network security engineer
at work and so this is a company

15
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,640
some of the metrics on them around 2,000
employees most of the nurses you know

16
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,180
all the admin people you know the normal
sea level exact director you know but

17
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,700
you have housekeeping and a bunch of
nurses the majority of them are female

18
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:44,850
around 30 sites included quick care's
doctors offices we had two major size

19
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,010
campuses and we already had decent
security structure so we had already

20
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:58,700
come a long long way when it came to
actually looting and putting a lot of

21
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,650
defensive measures in place already at
the hospital we got to the point where

22
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:10,200
we realized that fishing was something
that we didn't have any user education

23
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,209
yet so fishing was one of those things
that we knew we should probably focus on

24
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,209
now that we had actually gotten all the
fires put out and they gave me $1000

25
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:28,720
budget so thousand dollars $1,000 in a
normal like you're gonna go to fish me

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,320
or a coupon or whoever it is that that
sells these kind of programs is gonna be

27
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,670
way more than 2,000 bucks it's not going
to be catered organization but for the

28
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,950
most part but I've heard anyways and get
as much of the pain for book that you

29
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,790
would I think personally being able to
build from the ground up in an

30
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,870
environment that your know about $1,000
was i mean obviously not including my

31
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,840
time and all that kind of stuff but this
was just meant for the prices for the

32
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,580
awards

33
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:13,170
side never fished anybody before I
wanted to make it is blatantly obvious

34
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,959
as possible so I used a gmail address
the first one that I sent actually went

35
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,980
to use the harvester python script goes
out that scrapes like Facebook and

36
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,540
LinkedIn and Google for everybody that
with email address at your domain so I

37
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,880
found about 50 people out there that
came from our website about two

38
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,760
different things and that was my first
target I knew already you know the only

39
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,110
thing he only averaged occasion that we
did have was to become compliant you had

40
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,860
to do like the CBT is so once a year
they click Next Next Next then went

41
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,280
through five questionnaire thing so I
wanted a baseline I wanted to know

42
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,590
exactly what my users would click on how
many user names and passwords I would

43
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,360
get and kind of keep track of that
before I let anybody know about the

44
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,270
program

45
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:17,530
3216 usernames and passwords right away
and that that campaign I only looked

46
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:25,860
online for a couple days the only one
right click and the four reports weren't

47
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,930
right away either i mean it had spread
out over a week or so we had people walk

48
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,160
up to us and say something I think maybe
one person forwarded it just not the

49
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,050
best when you're when you're kind of
trying to rely on users to point out

50
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,320
things you don't know about I did make a
mistake side never used other than

51
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,650
sending myself from stuff and doing some
stuff like a lab environment and that's

52
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,660
why I see if we go back I said sorry
about the broken link is because I did

53
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,320
it wrong the first time so that all
fifty people and it didn't work at all

54
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,009
and Sun completely just crashed so I
just started everything

55
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,199
and it didn't seem to matter because I
mean it looked legitimate I was really

56
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:21,930
sorry yes and no doubt so here's the
second one I wanted to do pretty much

57
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,719
exactly the same thing still from a
gmail address still playing turks but

58
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:34,740
the link actually was a scrape of our
age our portal and it still was fairly

59
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:43,580
successful so I got 54 usernames and
passwords and and this 1 I'm pretty sure

60
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,699
I'm pretty sure this is the campaign
where I actually got our CEO who used to

61
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:55,469
be a C so which then I had to wait six
months before I actually started forcing

62
00:06:55,469 --> 00:07:03,589
people to again because we actually had
to build a program so we wanted a

63
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,060
program with teeth and doing it

64
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,880
let's talk next week they wouldn't let
me keep the slide I was very

65
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,840
disappointed so we call it something
smells fishy we wanted money we wanted

66
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,000
them to be able to remember it kind of
associated with different things so

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,520
everything that we did we tried to put a
fish name on it we gave them a little

68
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,960
bit of user education when it came to
internet page where we put all this crap

69
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,050
up there that they could go to to to
learn about what fishing laws on what

70
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,910
the actual program was and with will let
them know I'm a big proponent of using

71
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,660
the word hacker and positively so we let
them know that there is actually hackers

72
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,139
working at the hospital we were there to
help them we weren't there to smack

73
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,510
their hands when they did something
wrong and that we wouldn't be actually

74
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:06,430
using any of their stuff maliciously we
did a very large emphasis on reporting

75
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:14,200
and I'll come to them a little bit later
but just because they know what not to

76
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,850
click on doesn't mean we still don't
want to report don't not want them to

77
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:26,330
report it it's horrible sense doctor but
that was our our main emphasis was they

78
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,850
actually got entered into the words
program every time they would report

79
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:40,790
either me or actual legitimate fish that
had come in from the outside and we look

80
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:51,900
should report we had to come up with
some contest rules because we had people

81
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,970
trying to get around it by you know
forwarding stuff from home

82
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:04,190
oh look I reported this but no that
doesn't that doesn't really count so we

83
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:15,070
came up with these rules and then we
also didn't count spam and it slides

84
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:22,370
with lots of texts so so

85
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,510
monthly coffee shop in the hospital

86
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,050
monthly we would give them 10 bucks to
two different people out of the fishbowl

87
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,839
so we have like an actual fishbowl every
time they reported it we physically put

88
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,700
the name in it we would like make a show
of walking around and having people like

89
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,279
actually pick out the names monthly
quarterly and Red Lobster trying to stay

90
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,640
with the fishing them a little bit and
then

91
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,430
you're a three-under books Amazon so we
gave them a lot of his son of another

92
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,300
thousand dollars in all we have set
which was free I kept track of a chip on

93
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:09,950
the stuff in Excel which was horrible
and you know $4,000 we actually were

94
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:22,089
able to create more of a program then we
would have been able to otherwise

95
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:30,040
words and after they clicked on a link
or if they opened up at like some PDFs

96
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,959
to emails and sending out they were
redirected to this we didn't want them

97
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:45,370
to think they were in trouble I did have
an older nurse just completely botched

98
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:51,040
about she said that ours however how she
ever going to trust us again if we have

99
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:01,249
to if we put her through this but
whatever just we just wonder you in this

100
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:09,779
drawing then so this was one of the
first greens and then this was this was

101
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,620
the most painful and i've i've actually
I'm working on a program with a couple

102
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,870
friends of mine cuz i said i dont code I
do the other pollutants stuff some

103
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,439
working with some of the coders that I
know to create a an actual program that

104
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:32,470
will do this instead of keeping track of
an Excel because that took up the

105
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:41,309
majority of my time so after we created
the program after CEO and directors

106
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:46,059
actually better at it we decided all
right now will now have a baseline we

107
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:53,259
know what our people can do and what we
should focus on educating them for so

108
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:59,980
the idea was if they if they clicked on
something and fell for it they're

109
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,490
automatically re-enrolled the next month
if they successfully didn't click on

110
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,759
something or didn't give me their
username and password they were taking

111
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,290
off for a couple months so that way we
were actually focusing on the people

112
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,259
that were easiest to do and we knew kind
oh where we needed to focus on education

113
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,410
so if a lot of people in a specific
department were having issues we would

114
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,050
actually go and provide them education
in that specific department and it kind

115
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,340
of gave us an idea after their baseline
of

116
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,840
where they were getting better at so the
first three months I think it was it was

117
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,910
is blatantly obvious as I could possibly
make it without saying oh my god this is

118
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:50,030
terrible you should click on it again
from Gmail I made high importance one

119
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:56,990
line of text and that text right login
went to an internal just IP address with

120
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:07,100
a certificate error it was just
absolutely horrible like 324 it was

121
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,840
ridiculous like I mean I was the first
fish and I mean really it still makes me

122
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,460
happy but every time you get a username
and password I was I was like seriously

123
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,770
all Getty never United never done
anything like this before was only doing

124
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,600
window that I was I was super happy and
I was told that I should never tell

125
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,040
anybody that because it was a bad
reaction to have forgotten your words so

126
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,610
here's February had the same idea still
got 89 username and passwords but now we

127
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:50,690
have 49 reports so so good trend a lot
of the users that got caught the first

128
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:57,500
time working called the second time
which was also good March didn't really

129
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,650
turn out so well as far as results go if
you've ever heard of March of Dimes

130
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:08,420
hospital we like doing big donation
drives and stuff like that I think I had

131
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,000
already made a rule in Outlook to send
anything that said marks a dinosaur the

132
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,230
trash because it was just getting way
out of hand and super annoying or

133
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,080
getting like five emails a day on please
give us your money for March of Dimes so

134
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,830
I only got four but thirty-seven people
did report it maybe it was specifically

135
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,780
for the program I'm not sure but it was
nice that those were actually going up

136
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,690
this

137
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,860
really happy about this was one of our
Director level people a person that he

138
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,700
normally worked with another company had
sent him the email to click on what was

139
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,360
it says please kindly review the
important document I uploaded for you on

140
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,680
Google secure Dr click here for
immediate access from somebody he

141
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,020
trusted that he was working with on a
project he liked you know about the

142
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,280
seems a little beard I think I might
wanna ask before actually click on it so

143
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,260
you know we use like this this email is
a poster poster boy for what you should

144
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:15,910
do he had a bad feeling about it it
didn't he didn't necessarily have to do

145
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,350
anything other than a house giving them
quick and easy access to somebody that's

146
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:29,620
not gonna buried them is very important
so you know making him feel good about

147
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:38,090
the choice he made is also pertinent we
tried to include every time they find

148
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:44,200
one of the more fun when they put
together it's a three-hour fine china

149
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:55,270
set for $575 from Kohls than Amazon
email doesn't make any sense I actually

150
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:00,890
had a lady cancel her Amazon and her
holes card which I felt bad it was

151
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:08,140
pretty cool but I still feel and this
was looking for reporting only there was

152
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,290
no criminal capturing or anything so
turns 61 reports I felt pretty good

153
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,610
about this

154
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,620
third-party penetration testing we had a
bid to third party contests on every

155
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,350
year I asked them if I could use this as
an example in the slides and this was i

156
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,029
mean we're paying for this it's not like
just me a jackass at my computer has

157
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:37,000
never done this before sending out stuff
the legitimate they get paid for this

158
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,209
this is what the company does this was
their email didn't fish anybody it was

159
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,720
huge accomplishment this out two
different emails that with the two

160
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,670
different sections are they just kind of
the same the same method they scraped

161
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,670
under no fair use the harvester what
they scrape the internet to find

162
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,490
different email addresses for our
company and nobody was Fisher the first

163
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,839
one the second one they had left the
campaign up longer than what the scope

164
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,860
was and after that somebody actually
clicked on it I guess I cancer

165
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:19,490
accounting because you know bill
attackers scopes but depending on who

166
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,020
you talk to

167
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,010
response out of out of all the things
that are we're looking for and reporting

168
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,350
that's why you that's where you want
them to report it to you right you want

169
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,880
them to report its you can actually do
something

170
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,669
proactively that's that's going to stop
everything from happening effort either

171
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:48,429
they accidentally kills somebody has
shown their box whatever you want them

172
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:53,049
to be able to report it to hear some of
the IR after after that professional

173
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,929
email came in this was the timeline that
happen after three minutes it was

174
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,639
already reported and after 11

175
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:07,289
we had already know about it everything
I mean it's not it's not impossible you

176
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:12,219
just have to give the information to
your users to be able to report it and

177
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:16,149
that's the moral other stuff that we
actually had done other people too had

178
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,229
reported it as well

179
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:25,309
different directors this was another
fish

180
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:32,280
not great

181
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,149
the reporting

182
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:38,989
kinda went down at this point we wanted
to start working with our internal

183
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:43,419
marketing team to try and get like
posters out there and more information

184
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:47,960
and newsletters and that kind of stuff
because we weren't seeing as many people

185
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,519
interested in the program it had been
six months already or seven months

186
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:58,549
already and I don't know maybe their
attention spans and this is another one

187
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:02,839
that I really enjoyed doing we had just
opened a jade is a Jimmy Johns across

188
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,719
the street like a month prior to this
this was just to get the user education

189
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:12,029
out to a whole bunch of people I was in
capturing credentials or anything I took

190
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:17,700
that oh my god you that tax fly duck and
just made it into a PDF attached it to

191
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,590
see how many people wanted to 20% off
Jimmy Johns coupons so

192
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:33,850
reports which was pretty good

193
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:40,330
yeah this is my last one

194
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,510
same thing I just wanted to get it out
to as many people as possible I was

195
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:56,299
leaving the company anyway is so I said
fuck it and just Senate everybody I

196
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,039
really don't know if there are more
reports on that or not that's how many

197
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:08,470
there were before I left all these
actually show up every other place that

198
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,409
I've been all the all the projectors
show these graphs really shitty

199
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:16,370
afternoon exciting anyways but it's nice
when you can actually see the data so it

200
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:22,130
was you know the email son will always
vary depending on what I was doing or

201
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,870
what I was looking for and we see that
reported went from almost nothing you

202
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:34,010
can actually see reported on the growth
and the fishing went down

203
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,480
percentage just to show a different way
so percentage of reporting what

204
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:48,780
percentage official in town so what I
want and I wanted to put the whole it's

205
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,790
easy it's easier to talk

206
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,720
flies with honey than vinegar but it's
not a real thing so search for that and

207
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:05,470
from the xkcd so it turns out that I
talked to a couple other people that had

208
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,890
fishing programs within the organization

209
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,270
some of them actually had like walls of
shame some of their users got the merits

210
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:19,080
her falling for you know getting their
box infected we wanted to do i mean

211
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,300
we're pretty positive culture already at
the hospital so it wasn't that difficult

212
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,310
everybody you know kind of like a family
atmosphere everybody got along pretty

213
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:34,050
well but having a positive spin on
everything kind of got everybody else

214
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,440
not in the mood but they got them or
more apt to play along and more apt to

215
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:51,610
report it to us and that's from that's
from my Verizon Dvir so yeah that's

216
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,760
that's pretty scary you're not always
gonna do not always gonna not fall for

217
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,830
something not click on something that
opens on playing but the fact that you

218
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,500
get them to report it is the most
important part

219
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,360
who cares if they actually I want I
guess you do carefully gets the shower

220
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,820
on the box but if if if they reported
again as the most important part and

221
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,200
obviously no one is exempt I mean we got
physicians we got our like I said about

222
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:29,490
the CH the CEO CEO RIT assistant
director like it was a three-day weekend

223
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,900
he came in on a Tuesday wanted to get
through always email in Birmingham

224
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:40,169
username password he knew we were doing
the campaign will

225
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:46,279
getting the point across that's why I
wanted to work more on communication a

226
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:50,779
whole lot of people didn't actually know
about the program you know I gotta love

227
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:53,970
a service is done in the hospital in
your hospital employee it's cheaper to

228
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,929
go your own so you know every time I
went to you know get a prescription or

229
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:03,210
get blood drawn whatever I would make
sure trying to talk to everybody in the

230
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,070
hospital that I knew anyways to see if
they knew about it just to see how how

231
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:17,379
much outreach our current method of
getting the information was working and

232
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:22,440
it's free and always not in helping but
he said I should have more naked men and

233
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,299
a nice lights it's not one size fits all
but he talked to actually when I started

234
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:36,850
this I talked to a company worldwide
company has 24 hour helped us for

235
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:42,909
customers to call in they wouldn't
implement efficient program because the

236
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:46,299
people that were on there helped us were
constantly building so if you take time

237
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,929
away from them by actively fishing them
you're you're essentially taking any

238
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,359
other pockets and they didn't want to
implement a program like I'm happy to

239
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,919
say though babe I just got done
contacted by the same place and they're

240
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,549
putting in apps they hired a full-time
person to do internal assessments are to

241
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,230
lead their assessment team and start
fishing campaign so I got to talk to him

242
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,649
next week though on this to see kind of
what he's gonna put in place which is a

243
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:20,179
good stuff I'm really glad that they
they're going forward with it because

244
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:26,179
you know it's it's pretty important
everybody's gonna get owned and every

245
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:32,739
every pen tester uses social engineering
from fishing to get in if you know if

246
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,650
its scope so

247
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,490
change when I first started out the I
can't really tell the helpdesk what to

248
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,200
tell everybody and that seemed to be a
problem because some of them were just

249
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,760
ignoring it when they called in or they
weren't actually telling them you know

250
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,100
good John you caught it this is what you
need to do next time so from this from

251
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,990
the get-go what I wanted was like a a
script that they would read off of just

252
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,560
to give them an idea of what to go by so
we ended up doing that after a couple

253
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,200
months more automation cause the
spreadsheet socked adding fishing and

254
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,710
physical which I'm not good at all but
we're thinking about was like going to

255
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:22,000
and and swapping services with other
hospitals you know since everybody knows

256
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,320
your face you might be able to get away
with something else at another hospital

257
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:32,460
and then we're measurements call this
off all the all the templates all of the

258
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:40,480
blink phishing emails like HTML HTML
files the posters everything on my blog

259
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,270
if you want it and a couple people try
to use it in their organizations are not

260
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,960
sure how well was gone but hopefully it
helped out to create a program from

261
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,230
scratch and in these slides are online
too because that's a lot of crap but

262
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,130
different articles so trusted seconds a
good one about gamification than 10 has

263
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:05,010
a really good blog about it I think he's
talked about it several times the book

264
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:20,990
and I'm in the one the billing rofl
erode think you can clap

265
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:43,940
go back two sides any question please
click on it I did not personally but I

266
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,380
read some things where there's like
certain certain times of day or certain

267
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,700
days of the month days of the week that
they're more likely to click on things

268
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,620
yeah yeah yeah first for some reason
like Wednesday morning or something

269
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,460
sticks in mind when people are more
after click im not sure I'm not sure but

270
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,530
it's interesting I don't know if this is
enough data that tell plus I don't keep

271
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:17,340
track of the times either so any other
questions

272
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:27,160
ok so did the quest

273
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,920
consider doing internal emails like if
somebody's box have gotten popped that

274
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:42,110
last one but I still want everybody to
do that one was internal that was

275
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:50,710
actually artis chief of nursing's email
address that I guess what that results

276
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:59,650
in the September buddy yeah

277
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,770
by myself

278
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,890
good right

279
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:14,250
that shit you're welcome to take a nap I
don't know it and threw up on stage

280
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:40,390
right so he questioned was like
randomized the user selection other than

281
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,860
the last one or actually Senate
everybody other than that first initial

282
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:53,470
email that I used the Python script it
was completely random I just had just

283
00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:00,710
picked anywhere from 300 to 500 or so
people just not not to cover everybody

284
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,530
because everybody's on such close
working quarters but I didn't want to

285
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:16,190
get out you know from the mouth but it
was completely random

286
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:28,480
a lot i mean I'm gonna say we got maybe
a dozen a month maybe ish yeah I mean

287
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:38,679
some that we caught up front before the
users got to see him but you're free to

288
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:56,290
go

289
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:02,540
something to consider about the phishing
campaigns and I T being able to manage

290
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,610
maintain trust we tried to do everything
we could to let them know that we were

291
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,720
the good guys and bad people were gonna
make this happen anyways so the fact

292
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,180
that they're learning from office
instead of learning by getting their

293
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:26,550
credit cards stolen well as what we
tried to put across to them thank you

294
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:26,800
everybody
