1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,370
kick this off couple notes of process
except her first of all so one of the

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,260
tenets of speaking is to tell people
what you're gonna tell them tell them it

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,519
and tell me again I'm not gonna do that
another element is don't put slides up

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,800
there I charts some of these are in fact
some of these slides are meant for you

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,090
if you want to read while I'm talking
find that they're meant to be able to

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,500
download later in read this is
essentially more of a brain dump kind of

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,470
knowledge transfer if you do have
questions raised her hand I do you keep

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,230
it interactive to an extent try to keep
the pace moving as well this year I am

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,239
next away from the podium have a mic
finally he probably figure out very

10
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:40,600
quickly

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,320
hyperactive I walk around a lot and if i
moving too fast

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,020
also raise your hands they won't do slow
down so again Mike my goal here is we're

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,899
going to cover incident response you've
heard that the acronym DFI our digital

14
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,660
forensics and incident response to focus
on the incident response part will

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,410
allude to some of the stuff in the
digital forensics world but this is not

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,320
about forensic sign in necessarily here
it's a process of learning and talk and

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,799
again at the end I may have a second
section it depends how fast or slow this

18
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,580
goal is to go through a bit more
material my goal here is knowledge

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,700
transfer and again the focus of this is
how to respond to incidents and having a

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,590
process having a plan ahead of time for
if and when something bad happens your

21
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,400
thing I don't do too is out to like
stupid miles whatever I'm Derek

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,770
hopefully find this shit useful if you
don't you know something that's my goal

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,159
is here to give you some guy some good
stuff so you can go back to work with

24
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,829
something to look at differently
something to do you know action items so

25
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,979
security incident was my other slides
and assessed event of attempted access

26
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,119
unauthorized access or information
attack on automated information systems

27
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,369
blah blah blah him Google stuff you'll
get answers a paragraph long two

28
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,090
paragraphs long you can drink beers with
people in debate the ship for hours on

29
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,430
end what is a security incident someone
I used to work for actually said I want

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,600
you to go with DUI destruction of
interest information unauthorized access

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,030
use or disclosure modification or
interfering with systems operations

32
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,540
kind of covers it for the most part cool
I'll steal that he said go ahead so I

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,800
can use the DUI model for that each
organization's gonna be a little bit

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,930
different so I can't really answer this
question for anyone in this room even

35
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,500
myself as I change jobs and different
employers what people consider incident

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,920
and what they don't the tough tough
question I always think of incidents as

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,319
three different kinds right so human
resources related someone's

38
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,510
investigating someone for improper web
usage emailing off stuff you're not

39
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,560
supposed to email etc that schools in
the next 12 confidential leakage are

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,050
they stealing company data and giving it
to a competitor you know call this

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,050
customer lists etc

42
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,819
attack related incidents have we been
hacked whether it's humans are

43
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,569
combination humans and malware and stuff
like that

44
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,430
trying to export trade data from the
company also remembered nowadays to

45
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,989
keynote thing for his response it's
impossible to get hacked by something

46
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,700
basic it's always gotta be complex just
read the news right choice a

47
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,760
sophisticated attack remember that's
gotta be sophisticated always your

48
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,880
marketing people in legal people put
that in their email way related also

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,690
falls into the third category third
categories where I live I avoid human

50
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,170
resources shit like the plague anybody
support proxy locks her company over I

51
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,140
don't wanna know my fellow employees are
surfing on the web that I had to once

52
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,280
and it may going to some meetings really
weird it's like while you're a freak you

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,690
know you're thinking in your mind

54
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,840
holy shit I thought I was twisted man so
I have a way that stuff like the plague

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,630
confidential data leak incidents just
get so legal so fast and it just makes

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,470
it sound like fall asleep to me the fun
stuff trying to figure out whether or

57
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,080
not we then attacked or someone stole it
should offer network

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,010
again difference between privacy right
privacy incidence other ones we're

59
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,690
trying to say maybe somebody put out the
plans the blueprints for the new

60
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,300
whatever which we make etcetera wright
also sometimes it turns the privacy and

61
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,070
since when you have lost or stolen
equipment we might have to notify if

62
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,630
their stuff on there it wasn't encrypted
properly customer data etc right and

63
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,410
other thing to keep in mind too and I'll
just throw random tidbits in this is one

64
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,940
of them something I'm socializing I
company now is cuz we have PCI stuff

65
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,730
like PCI is not your biggest concern K

66
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,870
the FTC is gonna come after your ass for
customer information that's what gets

67
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,230
you a twelve million dollar fine on the
spot in 10 years full of external audits

68
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,560
gotta pay for the credit card shit if
you think PC to get their shit credit

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,840
card right here wanting anybody want my
credit card or debit card it's one

70
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,270
frickin phone call even on my checking
account I don't lose 50 bucks I make

71
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,270
goddam phone call I'm back in business
by the end of the day I don't give a

72
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,960
shit customer information for identity
theft different story so the privacy

73
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,780
word always reminds me that its
classification k the next to slide suck

74
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,630
and that they stopped because they've
been updated in years there's a point to

75
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:16,620
them meaning you can pick the stuff
appoint a part here you've got incidents

76
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,940
usually a rainbow color just three
colors these are like five from way back

77
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,690
when severe high medium allow that goes
off maybe had an incident response

78
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,210
process for just

79
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,550
I T incidents in general for the service
disruption etc

80
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,620
number of customers affected number of
systems affected etcetera

81
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,470
the point is you're gonna need a way to
differentiate stuff to some of the

82
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,300
significant loss of data large number of
systems compromised you know your attack

83
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,540
for sure you're not sure yet you know
it's these end up having to be in your

84
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,800
documentation somewhere how do you make
differentiate a really bad from a really

85
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,850
good one so I put these slides and again
some stuff you can download it later

86
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,850
look at this is meant to give you some
ideas

87
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,169
this is what I've seen other people do
this based on my view some of this as

88
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:01,969
well

89
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:08,610
all so I just to be complete put all
three of them there which one is like

90
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:17,089
bullshit just getting scanned right so
what is your response process have to

91
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,360
address now I start flipping everything
goes in acronyms right so priority of

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,749
incident response versus SLA work what I
mean by that

93
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:28,509
bau responsibilities the world can stop
you can have everybody from every team

94
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,969
working or security incident
necessarilly if you get so need you

95
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,689
might get a really bad attack is taking
down enough you're not working and have

96
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,119
everyone all over the place doing
everything right priority of your

97
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:45,269
containment example you've got a system
that has compromised his just a malware

98
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,419
type thing it's not really stealing data
might be infecting other companies

99
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,139
what's it worth to you if you make a
million dollars an hour on that system

100
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,610
you may not take it down to patch it and
remove the infection till six o'clock at

101
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,629
night right idealism for high school and
college students were in the world of

102
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,129
business if you work for a company that
makes money start learning business

103
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,399
that's why I learned business get a
checkbook best way to learn risk by

104
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,149
insurance that's the business you're in
you're not here to say no as part of

105
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,759
security that includes you know to say
I'm going to contain this right away and

106
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,719
shut down the business immediately gotta
stop all third-party connectivity right

107
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:16,879
right off the bat

108
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,409
no you're not gonna be allowed to do
that usually you need to know about your

109
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,989
emergency can't change control
procedures the next point i think is one

110
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:29,989
of the most important points in the deck
long ago probably over a decade ago

111
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:33,969
sands made a step-by-step instant
response guide that I read that changed

112
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,439
my life forever and it had in it and
that newer versions don't know why the

113
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,229
hell they don't you gotta have a gold
and silver team gold is management age

114
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,649
are legal etc they decide when to notify
business they make all the decisions

115
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:48,329
about what you can and can't do this
going to cost millions of dollars by

116
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,999
cutting connections silver team keep the
geeks on their own bridge keep the

117
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:55,639
managers the hell off the bridge the
silver team get their work done

118
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,229
silver teams usually runs essentially by
someone home security team right and

119
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,219
then you have a Siamese your primary and
secondary preferences but if people are

120
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,169
on vacation

121
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,569
you know they're on vacation right

122
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,710
the gold-silver teen model seems to work
out very well that means you have to set

123
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,869
the bridges and sometimes don't people
from the Gold team bridge will come down

124
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:20,809
and hang on the silver team bridge to
find out what's going on in figure out

125
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:25,020
how to put it into like non-technical
speak to give the executives of an

126
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,580
update

127
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,619
anybody ever been on incident we had
just one combined bridge freakin

128
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:35,300
nightmare right oh my god you talk about
people get in the way and you know what

129
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,899
else you don't want to be thinking about
shit out loud is geeks in front of

130
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,800
leadership and it sucks they don't
understand what you're saying and

131
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,209
anytime you say something that sounds
innocent to you they might be panicking

132
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,959
they just hear certain words not knowing
what the hell the context as they start

133
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,990
freaking out on the call

134
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,470
bad news he want to get the gold and
silver team in place there you go

135
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,550
Gold team start expanding over time to
worship it's hell God gotta call the

136
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,690
lawyers and again you want lawyers on
your phone when you're trying to do

137
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,339
forensics and containment stuff

138
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:08,269
hell no marketing people know where to
go to market people going to say we were

139
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:13,529
hacked by a sophisticated threat right
it was a double advanced persistent

140
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:20,259
threat who has been hacked by some easy
we were hacked by a kindergartner

141
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,720
by some African YouTube video right on
how to do shit and then ten minutes

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,850
later our data is gone you could do that
with the sequel

143
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:44,519
there you go that's like 40 or 50
anybody remember security reforms never

144
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:53,370
talked about how cool net products ten
years later

145
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,959
coordinator for the security what does
that mean means you're the portion of

146
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,810
the esta document as shit out of
everything you've got to be able to say

147
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,709
who did what and when you've got to make
sure whatever people are doing things

148
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:12,339
are gathering the evidence properly the
chain of custody shit right you're gonna

149
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:19,970
have to write the after-action review
from those meetings and then use a

150
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,600
Siamese subject matter expert various
platforms I believe in the hub and spoke

151
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,310
model and I believe no matter how much
earlier environment is you could be CMMI

152
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,319
capability maturity model 3 on all your
shit everyone in your company you're

153
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:37,819
always going to have some means that no
stuff right that inside now is that you

154
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:40,839
get from being there for a few years
those are the people you're gonna

155
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,620
desperately need of something really bad
happened at work they're going to know

156
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,230
about the radical segments that were
added last Tuesday that you weren't

157
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,750
notified of his you're trying to figure
out where the hell this thing can spread

158
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,490
to her what they can get to write their
gonna be there was no actually we had to

159
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,579
disable the personal firewalls last week
right shit like that that's your not

160
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:03,240
necessarily get that from the change
control thing anybody here believe

161
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,920
change control the save the world I am
an ideal guy man change controls been a

162
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,259
pain in my ass for a decade we still
have our just based on plan changes he

163
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:17,589
change Advisory Board meetings and all
that stuff so can't be just internal now

164
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,520
from people

165
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,780
has a typical incident flow reported by
Acts any SIM vendors in the room

166
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,030
bummer ok this one nice pisses off
lattice inventors thank you for being

167
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,060
honest raise your hand

168
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,440
really pissed off a lot of bodies good
friends that work for some companies by

169
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,480
the way and log management some also
been involved with for well over a

170
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,030
decade

171
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,930
well worth the time most of the weird
incidents in the really bad ones incomes

172
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,410
have been over the years have not
started from an alert from my symptom

173
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,420
management too or my IDs they almost
always start with a phone call it's

174
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,480
always the most elaborate member the OSI
model Larry humans it's the layer 8

175
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,300
ideas assisted men's or the users that
start the ship is just weird we did all

176
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,530
this other stuff even if you don't have
shelf where we implemented the stuff

177
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,340
correctly in it how does how it happened
we get notified frickin phone call right

178
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,630
to get notified of a potential incident
you sign into the coordinator now you

179
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,900
want to determine if there's an incident
are now whether or not need even pull in

180
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,090
the Gold team start making sure your
chain of custody stuff is there that's

181
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,250
where you start the timeline don't
forget the timeline but if you're

182
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,720
running in the middle of the night
trying to reconstruct the timeline hours

183
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,120
later you don't want to do that that's
like getting really really drunk in the

184
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,470
next morning get the other group of
people I'll try to figure out what the

185
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,150
hell happened the night before you don't
want to do that on an incident in and

186
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,690
you're also responsible for the report
so again if it's not an incident that he

187
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,320
might throw it off to a cleanup effort
for a triage you like okay nothing

188
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,140
really really bad happened we need this
malware clean off 10 PCs it turns into a

189
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,700
ticket inside remedy or whatever and
again the coordinator starts making sure

190
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,990
the channels are for communication open
up gold bridges silver team bridges etc

191
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,180
another one of those key points today

192
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,839
now understand in my mind I'm always
speaking for the enterprise that's at

193
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,930
least a hundred thousand PCs at least
10,000 servers I just go on that scale I

194
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,980
have work environments much smaller I'm
currently in a pretty small environment

195
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,230
I like five thousand servers 10,000
points and I know that there'll be

196
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,050
people that are an even smaller
environments so sometimes this can't be

197
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,290
done absolutely but you want to no
matter what obey the rule of two if

198
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,320
there's any way possible to do it if
you're a two-person shop I had my boss

199
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,170
start learning for answers when I was in
a two-person shop a little bit as far as

200
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,920
we could both do this stuff you don't
want to put someone on incident alone

201
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,390
cover rule of to no one's perfect as
much as I've done some of the stuff I

202
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,140
guarantee Oscar showed up I'll guarantee
you is specially at 2 or 3 a.m. I'm

203
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,240
gonna screw something up

204
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,370
rule of two you violate it at your own
peril is typically you're going to pay

205
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,750
for that if you don't feel bad

206
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,520
sequestering the IR team kind of
old-school ish at least some of the

207
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,290
stuff up here by the way like these
slides are over ten years old that's a

208
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,149
lot of the content so I it's it's just
there's a new twist on it in here but

209
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,290
that's one like from the old days
sequestering the IR team is anybody in

210
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,660
the same physical location anymore I
guess it depends on geography of your

211
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,970
company's facilities size a company
except maybe after virtually sequester

212
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,329
people maybe have places they go to
quiet room so people don't over here

213
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:34,220
talking in the cubes something to think
about ahead of time right

214
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,579
you need to know the policy for incident
details that means your gonna right now

215
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,529
our policy that's why you want to review
in know it to gold he's gonna throw at

216
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,380
you that's just to get job seems but in
the policy it says this psycho shit we

217
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,930
can update the policy that you're
getting called up by the gold bullion

218
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,430
frickin response has got a better thing
that you do not have a better method

219
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,490
that you didn't regress back in your
policy don't forget to keep all that

220
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,399
stuff in line and again sometimes legal
will will have cut off point where they

221
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,430
take ownership of the incident was
golden so I just put a lot of stuff to

222
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,670
keep hammering people's head on things
like the golden silver team I really

223
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,870
believe in this work for me everywhere
I've been

224
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,890
it has saved me so much time and effort
hassles big believer in that

225
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:22,670
so again how the incident communicated
basically management bridge deck bridge

226
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,250
is what this comes down to it again here
I'm doing and that's why it if you down

227
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,410
with us later and go through what's the
other thing I repeated it's one of those

228
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,650
I do you some basic tactics there is
again that damn rule of 2 I've been

229
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,910
burned my that bad

230
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,910
embarrassingly bad luckily I didn't get
burned paycheck bad by it so try to get

231
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:49,270
at least two people on stuff this one
again has a different view

232
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,339
yeah gold blah blah I have are you tell
us about that and they tell you to do

233
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,120
more to change controls all this kind of
stuff silver team right they have the

234
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,860
conference bridges they know all
gathering evidence all that kind of

235
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,180
stuff what's this

236
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,620
so some of you may have incident
management teams and they manage

237
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,200
incidents throughout the company

238
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,339
San went down right domain controllers
died 7 now just stuff like that

239
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:17,870
sometimes they're gonna front-end your
IR process not necessarily a bad thing

240
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,260
worked out in advance in larger
companies incident management going to

241
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,630
set up the goal bridges gold timber
doesn't still retain bridges they have

242
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,410
all the protocols for how to get the
business engaged even a lot of times

243
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,170
they have the status updates that they
did you text messages without any real

244
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,459
details to you know get sensitive
information away so make sure you talk

245
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,570
with those folks first is your
architecting all this process and

246
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,920
procedure on how you gonna respond to
incidents they may have half the

247
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,220
communications stuff documented and
maintained for you where they do it

248
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,990
cause you'll see some of the download to
get off the internet communications

249
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,240
login have your emergency contact log
well if you have an incident management

250
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,920
function that might already all be there
and if it's only missing a couple

251
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,330
contacts add yours into that a lot of
times this will help front end and take

252
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,150
a lot of almost like admin work off your
hands he can focus on more on getting in

253
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,670
some response process in place which
have to do that

254
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,740
you can start focusing on getting the
forensics in place

255
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:21,380
process before tools every time you will
get burned if you don't do that now

256
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,420
another thing I use for sands six-step
process preparation identification

257
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,610
containment eradication recovery
follow-up lesson learned I live and die

258
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,000
by this I've implemented this literally
at least half a dozen companies

259
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,390
personally as an employee and as a
consultant I've had dozens more flip to

260
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,490
the smile I told you buy into this model
right so again when something's

261
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,980
classified you've got incident this is
the way you run through it

262
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:57,130
preparation buyers play on the slide you
don't put arguably it is the most

263
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,570
important phase without preparation
you're going to have really a lot of

264
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,370
problems you can we get to a certain
extent been there for I learned this

265
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,090
kind of stuff

266
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:10,530
nice to win it so been there again our
policy processes forms and report

267
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,460
templates forensics tool kits and
scripts here's another important point

268
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,580
prior me repeat myself a few times when
I do there's a reason it's caused some

269
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,050
have been burned on anyone here a
standardized company images pretty much

270
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,500
ok if you have desktop standard images
in a change hardware they're doing a

271
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,310
massive hardware change did you read
test all the live memory acquisition

272
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,060
tools on it to make sure they still work
with the new shit you don't want to find

273
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,850
out at 2 a.m. been there done that so we
see later I mentioned tabletop exercises

274
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,800
for me now it's tabletop + always do
your evidence acquisition practice it

275
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,690
bi-monthly if you can meaning every
other month when you get new people on

276
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,910
your team if you're a larger team test
your processes best way to process

277
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,950
document said now someone knew the team
throw it to Manhattan do it if they

278
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:05,490
can't do it gotta fix your doc right so
it's more process procedures doc

279
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,389
more detailed instructions but

280
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:11,519
you've gotta run through this stuff on a
regular basis that's part of preparation

281
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,159
is making sure your shit works have
three different images can you image off

282
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,539
all 3 images

283
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,820
getting the hard drive images easy to
find where a lot of times you gonna do a

284
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,179
lot more live forensics nowadays we're
already seeing that ten years ago

285
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,749
yeah we could do that Runde against the
RAM and go ahead and run strings on I

286
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,820
got shit like volatility right so I mean
it's it's you're going to do more and

287
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,099
more live friend asked a lot and point
to start at the ability to do a little

288
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:38,820
I've forensics and get shit out of
memory on the machines out there in the

289
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,589
world to see what's going on so that's
that's all part of preparation again

290
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:45,629
policies

291
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:48,309
needless to say approved by upper
management clear into the point

292
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,899
practical practical and enforceable not
gonna go to stupid thing again this is

293
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:56,829
actually a nice one source unknown found
on the internet I wish I the damn source

294
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,109
for this actual copy and paste that shit
all over the place for policy document

295
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:02,320
it seems to shut people up

296
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,239
it works as a definition cause people
don't question it is just the normal

297
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,599
stuff and actually has the DUI stuff
baked into it is good policy process

298
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,429
procedure policies a statement of intent
in my world I know this another one

299
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:19,029
people have tons and tons of
conversations on processes the workflow

300
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:25,239
the framework right behind us specifies
named resources are teams when it has

301
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:32,999
two procedures are step-by-step right to
update your toolkit updates member

302
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,299
procedure document people afraid of all
this to like our can't do this much

303
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:41,479
documentation yes you can print screen
prints bullet points that's mostly what

304
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:45,679
your procedures documents are workflow
you know the process detailed work for

305
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,829
telling what steps do things in outlying
that that the two or three pager you do

306
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:52,839
if you look at it now and then you're
good policies high-level statement and

307
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:56,099
they shouldn't change that off and it's
like we're going to respond to shit in a

308
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:00,269
structured way cool

309
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:04,950
free download out there to terminate
maybe make a separate form for

310
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,349
determining whether something is in it
since you're not filling out too much

311
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,779
paper on it but you want a paper trail
this goes back to where you're trying to

312
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:16,159
justify your staffing overtime newsflash
company they gonna make money

313
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,559
about budgets which leads to headcount
staffing justifications etcetera

314
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,570
of metrics on how much stuff you look at
the time you spend looking at it as a

315
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,499
determinant is nothing that's the kind
of stuff you need to do so people know

316
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:32,239
why any the amount of people you do for
Internet response right incident reports

317
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:35,599
same information as the above plus
what's the exposure of the companies

318
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:42,570
involved locations details of what you
do when you get detailed eradication

319
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,679
your detailed timeline is in here
there's a lot of good stuff

320
00:21:45,679 --> 00:22:12,419
document template you could stand on
this something I did something I chain

321
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:23,839
of evidence the report itself would make
sure you do your follow-up like what it

322
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,599
cool if I mean let's face it work in
corporate America and also might be

323
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:35,129
governments that might be america has
everything you want something to happen

324
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:41,620
put it in Excel

325
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,790
work but especially Excel so I just
started doing my corporate geek

326
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,000
cross that bridge long ago lost all my
idealism sold my soul to my paycheck and

327
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,620
all that shit right why despite
everything Excel so that's kind of what

328
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,770
I do now for everything we have DLP
incident form that we do

329
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,950
guess what Excel cause someone's gonna
do something with it

330
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,730
you ever see someone that's why it's a
great attack vector by the way anyone

331
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,320
see any company in general especially
our user population whether as I T or

332
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,820
not people open Excel files because they
figure all that work I have to get done

333
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:19,620
they attached to the ticketing systems
all kinds of stuff cheat sheet one of

334
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,910
the things I do when you download this
now thrown up in PowerPoint format by

335
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,380
the way I'm such a moron with so this
MacBook I'm speaking off of I finally

336
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,940
got its an older one my mom had it
didn't use it for anything so I guilt

337
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,080
her into giving it to me now I realize I
Harley is max at all and I'm like I

338
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,309
couldn't get the PowerPoint Trans Am I
speaking off a PDF for proof right but

339
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,929
when you download the presentation I
gave a presentation to take the slides

340
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:48,910
and modify to your needs right now lots
of links the links are always hot ladies

341
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,540
alters cheat sheets those packet life
dotnet cheat sheets for other shit too

342
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,340
they got regular I T cheat sheets good
stuff

343
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,270
checklist and cheat sheets there's a
reason astronauts and doctors and

344
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,350
emergency medical technicians use that
shit we need to kind of copy that from

345
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,840
now right

346
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,260
help you not forget something at 3 a.m.
they're not the end all be all you may

347
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,170
go off script on some things we don't
have enough checklist and cheat sheets

348
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,410
in our industry and people don't take
him down in customizing enough for the

349
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,600
organization

350
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,210
kind of an opinion piece I know but I'm
just obscene not been burned by it

351
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,480
shit I forgot to do such-and-such didn't
do a write blocker when I took that

352
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,820
image now it ain't worth shit in court

353
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,220
cheat sheet what a savior again

354
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,530
tabletop exercises I can see this part
of preparation not meant to find every

355
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,010
process gap does reinforce your training
for silver team members out the

356
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,750
different platforms right Gold team gets
time used to some stuff I focus more on

357
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,580
silver team for tabletops

358
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:51,690
include evidence acquisition anybody
here had to figure out at 2 a.m. how to

359
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:57,100
use a tool when they're doing in
response as I have in it sucks it sucks

360
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,519
bad the time to figure out how to get
something done the you need done in an

361
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,779
investigation is not two or 3 a.m. it
gets really really ugly at that point of

362
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,830
the night so you want to figure this
stuff out ahead of time that's why I

363
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,990
said preparation is absolutely priceless

364
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,149
you know it's out of the six steps the
rest of them there's less material on

365
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,350
the most materials on preparation that's
the biggest thing you have to do is

366
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,830
prepare all this stuff what tools are
you going to use are going to use FTK

367
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:30,320
imager I can use didi off a Cali CD
whatcha gonna do what what are you can

368
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,529
analyze stuff we would use man in red
line are going to use volatility what

369
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:39,669
commercial tools he gonna buy and why
you gonna go with NKC DK if so what

370
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,210
components of those tools do you get the
lead all modules with you gotta think

371
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,840
about all this stuff but it starts with
the process that's something you'll see

372
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,460
me get on later as well to number one
thing that pisses me off that I think

373
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,909
makes us look amateurish people
qualified people that you invest in

374
00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:03,549
process in technology you don't get to
talk your way out of that shit ok for

375
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,590
some reason everyone thinks it to you
box won't do it for you box now

376
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,980
recovered installing a tool versus
implementing a process is a big

377
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,539
difference

378
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,230
installing a tool you can use a tel
number once you've installed the system

379
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,889
partition cause people don't have I T
backgrounds and don't know you never

380
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:25,240
install a damn thing to a system
partition right so they just install the

381
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,759
shit they click through

382
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,929
you think a few things out at the
command line holiday you need to read

383
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,699
the book and see the movie anybody ever
done both and he compared to when you

384
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:38,759
you just see the movie vs read the book
forces both need to do both in this shit

385
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:44,369
in our field and by the way if you're
picking tools in buying tools without

386
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,899
the process already in mind you got a
problem how the hell did you know what

387
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:52,379
you're buying something for what are you
trying to achieve by the way party

388
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:55,799
process documentation is going to tell
your scope purpose assumptions and

389
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,999
dependencies how many people support
forensics on max

390
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:05,949
people support forensics on iOS
currently where I'm at we don't we

391
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:11,519
stated you want mac forensics the fee
for an outsourced that shit we gotta

392
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,940
contingency contract prepare for 30
caddy African budget for the

393
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,679
investigation we don't do androids right
now we don't do iOS test shopped out to

394
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,190
so why would we worry about buying tools
that can do that actually put on the

395
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,789
ranch where we can do more stuff easier
for free you don't have your processes

396
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:31,929
and procedures in place a lot of a live
acquisition stuff just gonna be open

397
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:35,069
source any way a very good way I'm a big
proponent open-source how the hell do

398
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:39,789
you buy the all these frickin tools to
help him for what he's gonna buy that

399
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:44,929
she needs click the Install button
figured out man if you read the book

400
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:51,359
RTFM that saying is older than I am and
I'm 48 years old

401
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,909
there's a reason the same as that old
thomas' holds the fight fire with fire

402
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:58,599
people knew how to write a freakin
manual that saying came out right you

403
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:05,099
gotta do both so far preparation knowing
why you're doing what you're doing

404
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:08,699
identification again LA Times a phone
call

405
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:14,079
make it with your sim to get it tuned
properly or other solutions right so

406
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,009
here's the thing identification also
includes that people don't think of

407
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:23,599
scoping shit if the sign of this
compromise now known as IOC's indicators

408
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,159
compromise are these five reg keys we
run a quick script to see who all is

409
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:30,770
infected that's part of identification
see know what you have to contain right

410
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,590
also anybody ever hear it when you're at
work

411
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,600
go to command prompt on your Windows box
you're on your corporate machine type

412
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,330
that space if you know what happens you
know your domain controller is who your

413
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,460
mail server is you know what you can in
fact from your machine to other machines

414
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,220
by the way my favorite pet peeve that
pissed me off that commands been out

415
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:58,870
since I don't know before Windows XP and
people get into a network ports can find

416
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,120
other targets for Microsoft targets 108
user-level Commission on a machine that

417
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,260
view dumbass nine or the domain
controller is why make noise scanning

418
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,320
for shits it'll tell you can see helpful
it also in forensics lot of system in

419
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,800
tricks or friends except for indicator
tricks are pen testing tricks they're

420
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,810
all kinda combine that way but you want
to figure out what all can happen bad

421
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:26,260
from what you think was compromised
containment can be removal after you

422
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,550
gather evidence especially live evidence
network cable right away nowadays we

423
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,950
never did you got to gather evidence
first to figure out what's going on

424
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:38,020
you're live data stuff could be AC else
I remember having a see all the old days

425
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,050
when it was the worm day is having a
sale that would shut down parts of the

426
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,130
network automatically the network team
had those ready to go for that next

427
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,880
microsoft word that was going to come
out now is back obviously early two

428
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,790
thousands right don't forget when you're
containing the Gold team involved change

429
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,520
control procedures stuff like that

430
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,120
eradication again make sure you have
your evidence first follower live data

431
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,780
disk images eradication you can use
avian cleaning utility sometimes custom

432
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:10,060
scripts now sometimes your AV vendor can
be your best friend if it is a malware

433
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,380
related thing or has an hour later
component that can make a cleaner if you

434
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,250
already have the shit deployed here ten
thousand desktops use that

435
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:21,010
infrastructure allow your fix vs
inventing a new wheel right

436
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:30,940
recovery could be rebuilds especially
the workstation realm patching and

437
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,460
updating everything verifying systems
afterwards you can watch in your sim

438
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,550
tool if they start doing stuff again are
you not slow tools to see if the system

439
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:42,010
is behaves you can scan to look for
stuff got active listeners with a

440
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,080
vulnerability management tool sometimes
part of recovery is the implementation

441
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,930
of new technology and I know how many
worms it takes to get personal firewalls

442
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:54,940
and it made her insurance company took
three after the third when we finally

443
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,370
got our damn firewalls on the laptops
and desktops and stuff kinda interesting

444
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,190
took forever

445
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:09,160
follow-up I'm gonna put this number to
your simpy got all the stuff to do

446
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,740
everything to be prepared for it then
you do it you execute this can be really

447
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,380
important to what do you do after the
incident figure out process gaps fix

448
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,480
them maybe technology gaps technology
that you need address that right

449
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,380
architectural changes that come to mind
sometimes it takes a security incident

450
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,420
to get that IPS in line in between you
and your third party people that are a

451
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,660
dedicated third-party VPN concentrator
he knew that was the right architecture

452
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,400
all along

453
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,050
couldn't get it sold the incident report
from the shit that just cost you a bunch

454
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,820
of money says this is actually the way
to go now suddenly you got your third

455
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,740
party connections all audited all going
into the same concentrator and all

456
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,050
behind an active IPS in with other
monitoring etcetera followed can be very

457
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:58,100
important that's the last one but I just
put example for now I like now just

458
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,680
because it sounds like too much work but
things out there some people use

459
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,570
successfully by the way anybody if your
gonna do now in a corporate environment

460
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,190
you know he would anybody have an idea
who they want to talk to

461
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,799
go talk to a major university they've
been doing that for years

462
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,590
try to follow their model he even if
you're not BYOD they've got experience

463
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,039
with it just saying

464
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:29,899
follow-up after-action review separate
line for each class think they're both

465
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:33,139
important followed by think more for
following up with the architects

466
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:35,649
architectural stuff trying to get
approvals off stuff that you know

467
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:38,840
affects the environment after actions
were you really fully documenting the

468
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,490
lessons learned

469
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:48,090
you're looking deeper policy you know
sometimes lessons learned can be an

470
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,710
indicator of a lack of a countermeasure

471
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,919
as well just not one that just failed
sometimes something that you could be

472
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,600
that you're missing completely like some
advanced protection he hadn't thought of

473
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,659
that actually would work and here's why

474
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:05,360
another one the first one I like to be
lost as user awareness training not open

475
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,289
that can of worms have seen a lot of
people argue for an enhanced user

476
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,730
awareness training and depending on my
date either makes me laugh or to

477
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,009
structure it frustrates the shit outta
me because you know you an example my

478
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:19,539
wife to give a crap what I do for a
living in fact she does he really want

479
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:24,429
to hear about my career and also just
not into technology at all yet for the

480
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:27,759
past 10 years she's always amazed at the
people in her workplace that click on

481
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,320
stuff she never does see the user
training work with her now you're not

482
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,490
paying money to see if you can find out
how much money takes us on a person to

483
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,240
work station to fix the shit so I do
think there's a big bang for the buck

484
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,159
for user awareness training you want to
feed stuff to learn on security

485
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,740
incidents India user awareness training
what type of file you're not blocking

486
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,990
cause the business won't give you
approval no matter what then you need

487
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,009
your users know that the shields are not
beyond that I Kr business won't let us

488
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:54,010
block

489
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,630
taxis da texts through email they just
won't say I'm is using pulling example

490
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,290
out of thin air here you can't win that
battle no matter what will then you

491
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,190
better make damn sure users know that
they're not cover their cause users

492
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,970
might assume automatically the security
team is doing her thing protecting the

493
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,179
environment so you want to be aware of
feeding back into your training as well

494
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,460
on this thoughts on outsourcing desires
can ask a question

495
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,720
live forensics determining whether
something is an incident is pretty much

496
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,270
in-house malware analysis can go either
way depends if you want people doing

497
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,800
sifted rednecks all day

498
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,659
figure out exactly how the virus works
for you want to try to get it from your

499
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,330
AV vendor maybe a combination of both I
can't give you the right answer on that

500
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,960
right it depends on your staffing
profile in your operating model for your

501
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,040
security team companies budgets etc
maybe only outsourced imaging and

502
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,860
advanced File System Analysis know do
you want to go to court yourself you

503
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,610
want to pay someone else that's good at
it

504
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,690
here's your thing you better learn how
to gather evidence is you have to gather

505
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,560
evidence for the consultants there
probably around all over the country

506
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,840
gathered evidence for you or the world
that's why the IRS to keep in-house it's

507
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,780
one of the things when you outsource you
might get some of the DFT digital

508
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,580
forensics outside the incident response
you own that shit or your company does

509
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,970
right

510
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,640
see private have all this in place where
they're going to go with an outsourced

511
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,100
model or not I think of outsourcing that
which can be commoditized that's why I

512
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,819
said a lot don't have the time or don't
want to build the infrastructure for

513
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:25,730
stuff

514
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:32,230
pretty obvious point of this slide
always have a plan you don't want to be

515
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,710
in this stuff learn how to structure
stuff quickly in the middle of an

516
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,770
incident your live and die by the 80 20
rule

517
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,430
you're not going to get perfection any
more than any other service offerings

518
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,770
kind of implies that info second general
stop trying to get perfect you can

519
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,540
troubleshoot anything to death he can
nitpick anything to death he can take

520
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,310
any conversation to 15 levels lot
further than you need to write just like

521
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,010
I I hate using analogies to contain any
analogy apart gotta kind of using any

522
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,350
way to get your point across but I
understand that you need to structure

523
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,130
quickly that's where checklist and
templates have they also help enforce

524
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,710
consistent methodology like anything
it's all about the methodology when

525
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,000
people come to the security team get
different answers for shit all the time

526
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,530
it's a sign of an immature security team
what kind of brand are you putting out

527
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,650
there should have all your stuff
templating looking the same process

528
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,800
procedures checklist service offerings
track the maturity of makes this is no

529
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,300
different than other stuff you do versus
bill we just installed a product we just

530
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,430
look at the thing every now and then we
just click on ship the hell is that

531
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,000
right

532
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,260
you're there to offer services why I
don't hide the fact I'm big on high till

533
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,600
not the ideal that leads to a hundred
page manuals the ITIL that leads to shit

534
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,220
you can do with the screen print utility
right if there's something you do then

535
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,109
you can do in your sleep and you can
take the screenshots and write the

536
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:49,510
bullet points to do it

537
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,840
bullshit and if your manager your people
and got time to do this you got the

538
00:36:52,840 --> 00:37:00,590
wrong people that boring when you're
doing screenshots golden rule

539
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:07,690
I've seen as one violate a lot don't
panic don't let other people panic good

540
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,890
responders don't panic and keep the
panic level down it's easy to start

541
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:16,310
panicking by the way so that when the
few times actually legitimate work

542
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:24,010
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy until
presentation so tools the DAF of DFI are

543
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,660
what they call instant discovery
forensics lives forensics

544
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,110
have we been hacked term if humans
attack he was kinda what you're getting

545
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:37,120
behind it I like to give links to stuff
for people to follow up the things last

546
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,550
week I went through every day and one of
these links to make sure they're still

547
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:44,660
alive not even change some new ones out
for you and if they don't gonna be

548
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,880
pissed cause I literally just last week
the Internet should not change that fast

549
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,430
but so we've got different scripts for
Windows some of these are pearl some are

550
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,340
batch files I think there might be one
in there that has some that's using

551
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,270
powershell here's the issue on these
kind of scripts that have it it's kind

552
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:06,350
of a weird debate I have with myself as
well I'm not sure I'm and on this I

553
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,890
started out with batch files calling
external utilities knowing that if I run

554
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,420
like file minor problem on your gonna
see that he was a shift on the system

555
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,790
some of the deal all that makes calls to
it but it's mostly off system so I take

556
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:22,640
copy and that . XP for Windows and put
it off on a on a USB I'm getting the

557
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,910
routing table not if it's rooted what
the rootkit routing table would give me

558
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,510
right in its sole PowerShell you can't
do that with but I'm seeing people use

559
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,340
PowerShell more more for forensics
anyways I'm like but you are on Boxee

560
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,010
remote PowerShell you if that systems
rootkit its gonna lie to you and there's

561
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,290
really no chance of knowing that with
PowerShell it at this point in time it

562
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,510
appears I always speak disclaimers cuz
man as she gets really weird just

563
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,850
something to keep it keep in mind by the
way my customer batch files I had some

564
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,890
of the banks that everyone's name
knowing you're using that shit cuz it's

565
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:59,580
fast give it to someone out the field
from this batch file get back to me is

566
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,290
you back like 10 or 12 different Andy
five text files like a true what the

567
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,220
hell's going on whether I gotta call an
incident

568
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,040
call incident determination I told you
made that up probably a private find

569
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,450
that thing anywhere pry not result in a
search by zyce trying to figure out is

570
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,060
this shit real or not these little batch
files work man I put him on a network

571
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,490
share somewhere in let people run it
might have been the most friends of the

572
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,750
sound in the world but I did have MDN 5
in Dolton to its like you know I was

573
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,750
building a little das Norton Commander
many at one point on it just get the

574
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,820
event logs or don't get the event log
that's a lot more time to take some time

575
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,540
but i wanna know what the hell's going
on within about 15 minutes right so

576
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,119
again

577
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:42,119
bats + utilities our speaker mount slide
by the way so our show on WIC is always

578
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,750
local and again if you look in Proc mind
when you're running your utilities

579
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,910
Sysinternals are awesome by the way
totally I used the shit outta

580
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,820
Sysinternals anyone window systems and
abusing a lot but look in Prague and

581
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,460
you'll see that it does make all the
stuff on the system I don't know what

582
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,760
that would mean if you had a root canal
in all cases take the time to really

583
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,700
enumerate all that out my nice to just
do shit outright a batch file for

584
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,790
something that I needed to get based on
OS now but call the other batch files

585
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,390
from within that won him the basic
response is that all the routing tables

586
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:25,020
netstat ano Natsu A&B all that kind of
stuff and for those you so in Windows

587
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,750
they're cool command netstat -a and be
active network connections but it tells

588
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,470
you the buyer like Outlook Dec see what
exact words using the Indies to have a

589
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:39,290
staff report from found stone back in
the day or other utilities see seaports

590
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:43,380
to get that info I can get it from the
OS by the way that's also good for when

591
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,440
people don't know when you're trying to
firewall stuff we don't know what parts

592
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,099
are abuses UNIX Windows netstat Ashby
just do the be given that list out to

593
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:57,720
figure out these ports were right

594
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,970
admin tools help with forensics and vice
versa

595
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,650
and why do you want to customize the
scripts versus just download what's on

596
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,000
the internet was obviously it's
different AV Solutions right there logs

597
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,570
different place for servers web logs URL
scan logs detail this light as holy shit

598
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:18,490
wow that's an oldie add-on for Microsoft
Internet Information Server what was it

599
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:24,220
6 the last time I think that was used
how know it's been too long I can

600
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,060
mention volatility really cool right you
can either on dumping a tool called

601
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,680
memorized or you can use a search for
you know something to dump live memory

602
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,970
you can use DVD as well but many run
volatility and it actually gives you

603
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,120
stuff like that staff and look if you do
not stay on your computer and that stat

604
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,020
that a no show you your active network
connections try to figure out what the

605
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,340
hell you're things talking to and where
else can go and stuff we get a lot of

606
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,210
that pulled out of the memory of a
system now that's just a listing of some

607
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:58,220
of commands so again to reiterate the
point if you're using a tool for the

608
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:05,200
first time in response be where do you
have a lot of fun something I'm into now

609
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,390
what about environments where you're
doing desktop virtualization where the

610
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,820
images dissolvable hell of a business
case for this saves on licensing and

611
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,580
stuff so it's probably gonna happen in
some environments they gonna be getting

612
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,110
your choice whether or not it should
happen right what do you do in as we

613
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,610
move to cloud that kinda gets in here as
well but a Citrix environment got

614
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,850
NetScaler devices that can actually look
inside and see who's doing what in the

615
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,030
sessions as far as how long session
duration of what applications are coming

616
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:40,100
off what server for disc forensics
agents are kind of a no go right it'd be

617
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,980
hard to snap a memory image for
volatility officer the head terabytes of

618
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,990
RAM that all these sessions again serve
what can you get what's good enough as

619
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,360
we get with a charger legal when you get
your plan together what's due diligence

620
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,400
you know dis forensics gets a little
tough you can snap to VMDK is that the

621
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,930
stops running on talking on persistent
images not persistent images persistent

622
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:06,040
images without their VMDK is bau right
stuff business as usual stuff like that

623
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,010
folders during a remap folders for their
profiles as well as their files now you

624
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,500
got two sets of folders are gonna wanna
look at from a friend that standpoint

625
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,930
that might be worried the old trick the
absence of an artifact is itself an

626
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,130
artifact

627
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,630
or vice versa if they had their old
terminal server keys are all empty it

628
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,630
means the admin cleared out where they
were going to if you look at the

629
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:31,610
registry can see where people town it to
your party to or RDP to where the hell

630
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,020
is that going to solve the environment
you'll be in the config files that get

631
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,600
written up to their profile directory
make sure that start figure now hired

632
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,920
into forensics in that environment to
figure out what someone did when they

633
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,240
were connected into the dissolvable
thing you're not going to get everything

634
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,210
he used to figure out what you are going
to get I'm actually working on this live

635
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,620
now that's why there's this much thought
put into it cuz I'm actually running

636
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:55,450
into this scenario and it's a bitch so
you're going to depend on your proxy as

637
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,000
always

638
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,360
DLP and environment virtualization is
going to change your cat categorization

639
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,640
they're all gonna look like they're
removable drive events have to alter

640
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,580
some process their families normal anti
virus seems to work in these

641
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,280
environments they've made it so it'll
work pretty well and you get the logging

642
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,940
from it you can still get value from
antivirus even know whats pattern-based

643
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,360
and therefore supposedly completely told
me that just like firewalls even though

644
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,200
they work great for segmentation write
an instant response you think a

645
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,470
segmentation and slightly different way

646
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:29,790
segmentation think of it like a
submarine turn off valve so that room

647
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,260
doesn't floods of the ship doesn't think
so I'm actually at my house read on that

648
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,380
way when I do the plumbing second turn
off one room inside the entire freakin

649
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,070
house right

650
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,040
a memory problem with one saying I
should be able to turn off one room that

651
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,300
room but anyway

652
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,950
segmentation they're also for that yeah
that making those kinds of boundaries

653
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,840
that's why they're not dead

654
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,750
ideas didn't die like everyone said it
was going to either just rolls they

655
00:44:54,750 --> 00:45:00,420
should be aware of the classics helix
fire Cali sand sift rednecks for reverse

656
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,680
engineering I just put these out there
if this is news to you you want to get

657
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,100
it so this is not news to you you want
to be familiar with this kind of stuff

658
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,660
and what it does and you can use the
hell outta sands and RAM next 44

659
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:19,000
response tough just put some links to
rootkit detector people ask again disk

660
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,050
imaging you can get hard hardware
imagers if you're doing enough imaging

661
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,070
you might have the money for my justify
the expense for you just plug the hard

662
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,520
driving for one year

663
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,950
workstations and an image it real quick
I'll just put a thing for network

664
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,830
security only not to forget you don't
network type forensics security onion is

665
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:44,890
awesome very worth the time to learn
again Sysinternals is pretty standard

666
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:51,390
thing I put links to these books hackers
towns anyone heard of these books three

667
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,560
books full of real-world scenarios I
can't believe they wrote these are

668
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,490
awesome they give you the evidence walk
you through how they found it but then

669
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,960
you get to solve it and they have the
answers in the back of the book the

670
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,860
stuffs kickass you talk about great free
training and they're tough I felt stupid

671
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,980
somebody's have made me feel really
stupid some of the scenarios I made it

672
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,740
through all three books right but what
I've done in these books some of it made

673
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,010
me feel humbled in a good way holy shit
it's the real world stuff in the back

674
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,390
and in Europe working through files
tracing through what happened it's kind

675
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:25,790
of cool right I always like to give
references to books some of the stuff

676
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:30,650
sands courses I had a hacker sand SEC
level four course was good but I was put

677
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:34,490
in the latest version of the books are
some of the older versions and mentally

678
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:40,970
having read the newest version but this
is the newest version of that book I'm

679
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,610
going to blast through something fairly
quickly I like to put bonus material at

680
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,540
the end and I've got the time for right
now

681
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,340
operationalizing InfoSec this applies to
everything I've already talked about

682
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,410
half the stuff to you somehow that's why
put these lies in as a reminder you're

683
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:59,850
trying to provide a service think of
your incident response like anything

684
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,300
else you do like your intrusion
detection service like your

685
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,080
vulnerability management service for the
company you're building and operating a

686
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:13,950
service you need to get as mature as you
can I took this right off Wikipedia

687
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,740
initial repeatable define managed
optimizing their ego

688
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,540
what the hell does that mean even
there's an idea for a log management for

689
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,780
you this is my free to take back you can
take these slides and change in four

690
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,880
different tools you have in your
environment in general

691
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,650
how do you tell what's mature and what's
not how do you tell if your tools that

692
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,170
optimize your process just a way to get
you thinking about it from a maturity

693
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,799
perspective right basically looking for
integration automation documentation

694
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:42,119
standardization can you repeat the stuff
over and over

695
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,609
right operationalization who can do your
imaging you gotta see our field techs

696
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:50,349
can take a proper forensic image for you
in a big enough organization you might

697
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:56,119
want to write that's how to build and
here's the other one people process

698
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,589
technology you cannot talk your way
around this if you think your just gonna

699
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:03,309
buy tools and run tools to secure your
company or your environment we're going

700
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:06,710
beyond its a response here to security
in general that is probably the industry

701
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:12,200
everyone's right here if you skip these
two don't even bother with the third

702
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,769
time I can take the third whether it's
open source home-grown some are better

703
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:21,299
than others some require more automation
more work to automate than others but

704
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:24,259
the reality is what the hell you trying
to do you need the people to do it right

705
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:27,619
need to know what you're trying to do
that's the process a process by the

706
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:33,480
processes you know your scope purpose
and intent of things right so again

707
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,740
processes are flowcharts and bullet
points procedures are just a shit ton of

708
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,440
screen prints with bullet points we've
already covered this one

709
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,069
installing a product overseas
implementing right anybody can install a

710
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:51,579
product and this is just an example for
process documentation when I mean by

711
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:55,400
could be a little section of a bigger
doc sometimes you have a separate doctor

712
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,730
some of these things what's the roles
responsibilities how to handle the tools

713
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,740
naming conventions for forensics tools
to have a naming convention have a

714
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,799
different incident number for each one
does that reflect in the file structure

715
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:08,819
using two-story residence right what's
the architecture gotta think about where

716
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:12,450
you gonna how was all your stuff just
have Dr locked in a cabinet that the

717
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,160
building burns your daughter doing now
and then moving to backup tape and then

718
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,240
have the backup tape they come outside
like an Iron Mountain unlock the bug you

719
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,660
unlock the box put the tapes and they go
off site that's party architecture right

720
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,690
how do you maintain your products how
often do you update your friends experts

721
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:32,750
solution stuff like that and again when
there's racy models talk to the people

722
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,089
here to make a racy model with you can't
talk about how teams are going to work

723
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:37,980
together not have all the teams are
going to expect

724
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:44,210
to work together in the same room and
again you're offering a service here

725
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,970
some of the solutions you some people
look at solutions Morris tools based

726
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,609
services more as process-based

727
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:53,930
whichever works best for you are you can
combine the two

728
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:58,440
this book will get you into branding I
think we read enough technical books we

729
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,660
need to read some non technical books to
get you into being conscious of how to

730
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:07,700
build your brand and maybe build your
team's brand my favorite pet peeve again

731
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,040
this gets you a quick intro as with
always I'm not saying everything and

732
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,460
every book is correct the redbook think
I should be required

733
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,930
think people should be allowed to be an
InfoSec if they don't read the redbook

734
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,480
my own personal opinion cuz it gets you
think about structuring having your shit

735
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,750
together it's a little bit too detailed
your priority dial it down a notch but

736
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:29,040
it is only like that fake right and then
the Phoenix project is a story that

737
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,480
kinda introduces concepts and a box and
stuff it's an idealistic story but a

738
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:39,770
great way to get some of the points
across and then I will have this posted

739
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:46,330
Monday sites.google.com / site / dep
millroy

740
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:53,410
my dogs security people get some good
shit out of this good ideas good stuff

741
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:57,340
my goal that is this is like an hour
hope you have to stop you can take back

742
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,100
to your work look at things differently
help you enhance what you're currently

743
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:07,880
doing so I appreciate your time and if
those questions if not you know I'm here

744
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:15,950
for a while he can catch me on Halloween
ask me stuff to download is gonna be at

745
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:21,930
sites.google.com / site / dep millroy
I'll have it up there Monday I'll put it

746
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,230
up when I get back in it back home to
get back in town give you the power

747
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:33,670
points you can edit the stuff that we
can just take it and use it

748
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:40,770
a recommendation for is it incident
versus not incidents starting point

749
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,730
first I try to figure out if its a human
doing something versus an automated

750
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:49,099
script when I try to figure out if there
is data exfiltration attempts are not

751
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:52,839
right off the bat of something really
bad otherwise it's just a nuisance to me

752
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:56,089
thanks
