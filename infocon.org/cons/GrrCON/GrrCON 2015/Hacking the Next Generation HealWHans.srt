1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,150
staying well this is my

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:22,289
more interesting this has to do with the
future if you don't care about the

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:29,640
future of info see you in that beard and
leave right now just kidding that's cool

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:44,120
that's why it's recorded alright folks
let's begin to my generation of users

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,309
remembers back when technology was
complex had certain basic requirements

6
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:57,530
such as things like reading typing
asians true mobility and the

7
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,670
consumerization of I T

8
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,939
today's generation doesn't have those
minimum requirements things are very

9
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,890
much different so we talk today about
hacking the next generation the cyber

10
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,500
frontier while you can tell that yes
there are some Star Trek and amines in

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,980
there so there's the classic card
facepalm and because we mentioned cyber

12
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,580
we had to put a little writer and there
and we promise not to have anymore

13
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,159
Star Trek names throughout the rest of
their presentation what kind of going

14
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,620
back to that concept of mobility
consumerization of 18 able young users

15
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:40,420
because they don't have to have
requirements such as reading typing and

16
00:01:40,420 --> 00:02:02,570
patients we have this

17
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:09,140
to shoot people

18
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:18,060
sorry we say yeah yeah it's ok to share
my passcode with people who agrees with

19
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:30,420
that kid behind agreement so about a
year ago we took the video actually a

20
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,530
year ago my son received his tablet he
was around two years old he really

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,530
didn't speak too much and now he's gonna
be he's three now and he's verbalizing

22
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,660
his username is just as Pasco to get on
his tablet and is an incentive behind

23
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,570
that and the incentive is to go and
watch videos to go play a game to do

24
00:02:51,570 --> 00:03:00,430
something that he wants to do so he can
interact with the device so the kids are

25
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,400
just wired to learn right they do
inherently they do without trying and

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,540
one of the things we we we see that as
something that we can also then create

27
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,140
an environment for them where instead of
them sitting there in just learning and

28
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,950
having information kind of repeated over
and over again until they finally learn

29
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,440
it why not create an environment for
them where they can actually play and

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,959
then use that wiring to learn as the the
desired by product and that's why we

31
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,799
created for kids so if you haven't heard
about half the kids have great but we're

32
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,959
basically just a group of information
security nights he makers people in the

33
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,310
community who want to teach Internet
safety best practices as well as give

34
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,260
you a safe place to explore stem science
technology engineering and math

35
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,670
and that's really kind of the basis of
what we're doing now if you also believe

36
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,840
that we're responsible to educate the
future of info second I T and we have a

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,090
lot in common because it is our
responsibility to do that throughout

38
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,310
history we've all learned from our
predecessors right and his response was

39
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,350
our responsibility to make sure that the
future of that knowledge is handed down

40
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,830
its handed down properly and that kids
are not just going in using technology

41
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,370
they're able to do whatever gestures on
whatever device they're using but they

42
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,600
really understand how it works and doing
that is going to create the next great

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:43,330
innovators so when do we decide to
create a corkage

44
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,570
you can see here there's February 13
2013 news a tweet that one out as a

45
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,900
group of people that were going to start
a group conference call

46
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,660
thought con kids and I saw that sweet
sounds awesome has for a long time

47
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,210
inside of me I've had this kind of
burning desire to do a conference and

48
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,770
there's a lot of carpet is going on you
guys know that there's so many cons why

49
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,949
create another one for the sake of
creating one so when my son here started

50
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,380
asking me questions about technology
when he was five years old

51
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,010
try to explain it and we couldn't find
anything that was really appropriate

52
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,970
procedure we wrote a book and an epic
was kinda like much more pictorial

53
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,889
representation what's going on and I
just kind of start to teach kids like a

54
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,789
little bit of the basic ins and outs of
technology and so good practices in

55
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,280
little bit of ethics but you know now
he's grown up

56
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,650
from his perspective that was a baby
book so what do we do so i got really

57
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,510
excited when it was a thought con kids
so we can participate in continue to

58
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,639
educate future generations of 18 InfoSec
so I replied it's a thing as you think I

59
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,550
could help out and they said yeah I was
like so cool so when can we get on the

60
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:08,290
first call so now for organizers 25 and
then the folks over thought con that are

61
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,630
on the board of thought I decided not to
expand into kids conference when I got

62
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,150
the news I was just totally deflated
that sparking me went to smolder and I

63
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,820
was just like well let's just continue
doing what I'm doing

64
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,440
organizing minecraft clubs for kids
doing stuff with scouting and it just

65
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,979
was like that's just how it's going to
be but then after some time I want to

66
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,669
just start to organize this event

67
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,229
talking to some other people and they
said yeah we really need to do this so

68
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:44,090
we started one in Chicago back in 2014
so this was on August 23rd 2014 last

69
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,240
year so we just started the conference
there's a bunch of people that were

70
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,600
there we had just about forty kids and a
bunch of staff and some adults who were

71
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,320
just around a hundred people back for
sure one of those people in this room is

72
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,520
just entered and then we we wanted to
provide things like there was one person

73
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,710
at the head his own homemade half's was
like wow that looks really cool he

74
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,970
showed me a picture of a robot made from
galvanized garbage can in a large

75
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,200
windows and wi-fi controllers and
there's a tablet on the front of their

76
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,050
website and that's the same kid that you
saw it

77
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,830
video earlier is a bit younger and he
was really speaking much but he was

78
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,330
pretty afraid of that robot does it was
a little bit larger than him but then he

79
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,700
noticed that I could see it there's a
pail of lifesavers candy so his

80
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,090
incentive was candy any overcame his
fear

81
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,800
we do other things with electrical
engineering so this is some stuff with

82
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,460
Snap Circuits that we do we have also
this guy here I introduced them to

83
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:50,020
Arduino was called decoder so craft
encoder I showed him an Arduino and I

84
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,570
did the blinking light schedule ago
isn't that cool we got the light goes

85
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,470
can you make it more code so talk about
a kid wanting to challenge a parent so

86
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,080
we sat down and went alright let's go
through this so we showed you know we

87
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,300
changed different intervals for the
light blinking that we figured out . and

88
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,060
we forget out dash and then we just kind
of did like

89
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,000
asked an SOS it was a lot of commands it
may be a better way to do this so we

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,490
then those commands down into functions
called dot and dash and then we created

91
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,430
the alphabet based on calling the
function and a show showing him how to

92
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,350
function calls and is actually is
actually pretty cool to me incorporated

93
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,419
that into a creek is part of a scavenger
hunt so I mean who in this room

94
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,310
code is but who knows who has it
memorized military people but not too

95
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,580
many people memorized Morse code anymore
you learn SOS and that's kind of

96
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,930
education ends so that's one of the
things that we're doing we want to

97
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,810
reintroduce how important knowing
something as simple as Morse code

98
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,390
because it's an international way to
communicate so somebody speaks French or

99
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,290
whatever you're using Morse code the
same way we do which is actually pretty

100
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:06,279
cool to hear to hear was one of those
kinds of kids at like to take technology

101
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,709
apart and probably got in trouble a few
times maybe got hurt a couple times too

102
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:19,270
quick story personal story my son was
about eight or nine and your member win

103
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:26,339
TV's or like a piece of furniture in
your home right so we had this TV

104
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,610
it was really cool and I wanted to see
the people that were like on the inside

105
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,749
so I got a screwdriver they take the
back off and people but it was all these

106
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:40,019
little light bulbs in there with some
medals in the transistors and I was like

107
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,660
this is kind of cool let me go touch one
well it was still pretty hot as a TV

108
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,170
just got turned off so I learned that
lesson that day my parents are unaware

109
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,809
they were but there was nobody watching
me there was no main tour and then the

110
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:57,740
other thing is I forgot to unplug it so
you know having a screwdriver my hand

111
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,490
reaching inside a TV not a good idea but
that was me and luckily I survived it so

112
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,230
you know if you're kind of like that so
what we've done here what we provided

113
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,879
this technology destruction village for
the kids so they can reverse engineer

114
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,600
home-based appliances or whatever it now
before you start thinking about

115
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,029
microwaves it's really like home routers
or a small fire walls DVD players VHS

116
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,779
players remote controls telephones I
could see we've got some PDA's game boys

117
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:34,050
keyboard they love taking about keyboard
keys out there pop in the keys out and

118
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,149
kind of thing and one another to having
a good time but they get to really kind

119
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:41,829
of see how work goes this guy here when
I was still playing World of Warcraft

120
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:45,170
was holding him in my arms would you
like two months old he's kinda like

121
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,589
batting at the keyboard and when you
think about it that was like his real

122
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,980
first connection with a computer is the
keys video right so being able to see

123
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:03,029
inside is a really big deal for them so
what has happened kids well first off we

124
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,550
are registered 501 C three with the IRS
that means we are charity work education

125
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,470
based charity so that means there is
there's no motivation here to make a

126
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,019
profit there's really nobody at all
being paid it is nobody being paid on

127
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,959
her kids or or 1099 or what have you

128
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:26,639
everybody it's all volunteer base we got
our 501 C three earlier this year

129
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,360
part of my background on only 19
information security is also my college

130
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,820
education is important

131
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,760
professional work experience in
accounting so having that face knowledge

132
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,010
is really helpful also work when I lived
in New York City New York

133
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,890
kinda understand public servant
mentality a little bit so I waited until

134
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:50,120
right after New Year to file our 501 C
three thinking that we had a really

135
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,390
small form that you like me to like four
pages versus someone who might have been

136
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,670
around for a while had a lot of
transactions over a quarter million

137
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:04,210
dollars in funding to be reformed so you
come back in the holidays 2012 big form

138
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,650
you want to do little wine so might it
to you is if you ever have a 123 or some

139
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,510
kind of charity

140
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,390
when you know that employees are not
going to want to work too hard and make

141
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,530
sure that you don't have too many
transactions when you do it in some

142
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,960
places some groups weights of space
might wait three or four years ago we're

143
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,290
gonna file 510 523 but because it had so
many transactions

144
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,720
it's a longer review process so my trip
to you we file it was january 3rd online

145
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,160
I think their website was broken I think
it might actually went through in the

146
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,380
fourth and on the 9th we got approved
which is pretty hard to do is actually

147
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,240
was pretty cool so we're thrilled about
it haven't been able to tell by my duty

148
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,670
as one of the things we do so we started
our first event in Chicago I just off

149
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,250
the pictures but then kind of branching
out to other cities independently is a

150
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,740
big challenge and fortunately knowing
other people that run conferences like

151
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,560
encircled city khan made it practical to
partner up with them they want to do

152
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,930
something to do now it's really kind of
a win-win where its economy had a

153
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,070
cricket village we just did something on
Sunday with recon so we did a package

154
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,910
Bruhat on Sunday and that was our first
internationaux had four kids and it was

155
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,410
done in three languages I think the
person that came the farthest as a child

156
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,800
was from Saudi Arabia but parents are
from states just stationed in Saudi

157
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,320
Arabia and throughout the Belgian which
I thought was pretty cool

158
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,120
and a lot of fun they learned a lot and
we've been delivered a safe and secure

159
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,740
online presentation in three languages
and then obviously you know today so

160
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,670
tomorrow would do and a half kids here

161
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,680
well at this point may be inside you
thinking like this is a great idea we

162
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,990
might want to do what are you organize a
b-side or some other conference and you

163
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,040
wanna do something like this

164
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,770
well we have a Google Form that we need
to finish populating which began to get

165
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,760
caught up as we had a lot going on we'll
have a form for you to fill out this

166
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,140
link will still be active but don't
worry about writing it down now being

167
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,810
recorded the president be made available
online and if you do want to do

168
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,560
something or even kinda helped us out
maybe you want to branch into something

169
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,400
else let us know in fill out the form

170
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:27,940
discuss another point is at a cricket we
take child-protection very seriously

171
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,490
you see the punchline the joke is that
is funny that's one of my other kids so

172
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,430
very seriously actually we a lot of my
training comes from

173
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,690
Scouts of America would use protection
and adult protection type training and

174
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,300
in really good practices like what the
Boy Scouts calls to deep leadership

175
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,600
salvi million anybody we just call it a
two-to-one ratio that really means is

176
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,140
there's never one child left alone with
no less than two adults and it actually

177
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:05,270
protects all the parties so this way if
it's a one-to-one aside from parent and

178
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,030
child

179
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:12,690
biological chaperone link so if I didn't
know him and we were alone maybe he

180
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,780
wants to tell me some kind of joke
that's got some inappropriate content

181
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,620
and I feel a little awkward about it but
i dont wanna make him feel bad so I

182
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,080
kinda play-along humor him he goes back
to his parents and says I told mister

183
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,130
schwartzberg is really funny joke about
whatever you know inappropriate content

184
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:35,800
so here is the funniest thing in the
world and then his parents talking to

185
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,550
you about those kinds of things and now
while I'm trying to be a nice guy I'm

186
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,940
now being in some wrongdoing which
wasn't true so that's why we have this

187
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,080
process of

188
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,090
we never leave any kids alone without
least two adults now you might be

189
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,710
thinking about restaurants what we do
there well harder harder access to

190
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,980
control we don't pose security in front
of the restroom but it's basically

191
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,630
common sense you walk into a restroom
there's a kid in there by themselves

192
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,900
you go outside and wait then when a kid
leaves you can go in if you're in there

193
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,540
already and kid walks in a loan quickly
finish your business and get out just

194
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,050
very basic common sense to protect all
parties the other challenges we have one

195
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,790
soon

196
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,830
volunteers so we don't generally accept
any volunteer up the street you know you

197
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,640
might be a really nice guy but he
looking like one right now and the

198
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,380
reason is again to protect the kids so
if we have a vetting process so for

199
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,010
example Robert Wagner he's on the board
I've known Robert for a number of years

200
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:41,110
ago so no know people who know Robert so
they were kind of you consider that that

201
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,510
fourth factor authentication it's not
you know something you have a you are so

202
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,980
you know it's who you know where someone
you know and I asked around into before

203
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,220
you know it Robert help us out like
everyone said yeah he's really cool he's

204
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,180
safe and he's he's fine but if we've had
some people that just kind of come up

205
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,220
after these presentations like I really
want to help out ok so what do you do

206
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,810
with kids today you know so we can talk
them through it we do have a hidden

207
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,900
volunteer page so someone sounds like
there okay like for example a soccer

208
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,790
coaching every year that's our
organization is going through some kind

209
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,910
of Youth Protection training doing a
background check again on the adult

210
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,459
we're cool that we might just wanna
letters saying you know they're good

211
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,240
things like safe and secure online with
the icy square Congress foundation

212
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,800
excuse me they do their own background
checks on people so we've had some

213
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,210
people do it safe and secure online
presentation we know that they do a

214
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,870
background check and then we let them
come into the presentation but they

215
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,100
don't get to really hang out we can have
lunch and then they go about

216
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,559
volunteering we can discuss that a
little further

217
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,289
photography is another thing that we
like to control so here in this

218
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:54,779
particular case nobody can recognize
this kid I don't know who he is but the

219
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,999
retail instructor photographers very
specifically take photos that I like

220
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:03,399
back ahead or slight profile so this way
if we do have anything that we put

221
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:09,409
publicly on Facebook social media
website the kids are see what you see

222
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:13,679
here is a kid using Snap Circuits I got
an Arduino that blows Morse code and

223
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,419
that's the important message for you to
see you don't need to know who that kid

224
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,220
is an impact against me just as parents
and close family might even though it is

225
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,730
another example where there's a youth we
call them Tyros which means learner door

226
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,249
or kinda like a novice beginner one of
the staff came up with a name and you

227
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:35,309
don't know if the styro is a boy or girl
curly hair

228
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,289
you don't know of abusive parents
helping the tyro with putting us in

229
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:46,179
assembling a popsicle stick so we have
controls a photography and it usually

230
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:52,669
goes usually it always goes right from
the photographers sdcard to me and I

231
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,799
control over photography so this way if
we want to do something in like

232
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,590
sponsorship type of documentation we
have it or anything that we share like

233
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,340
there's an actual piece of the child
then we send that to the parents on a

234
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,860
prob with a privately these are the
badge badges that we've been using the

235
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,799
past year so these Tyros have actually
their own symbol which is that simple to

236
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,090
the arrows pointing downward you could
see the collider is on there you guys

237
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,019
know provider

238
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:25,110
know it's the hacker symbol if you've
never heard it before but this simple we

239
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,999
created for the tacos that arrow is
actually an order symbol meaning

240
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:35,440
strengthen warrior and then so that
satire Cyr Cairo

241
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,590
vou got circle in his circles
representing the unity of the hacker

242
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,369
community as well as the hackers
never-ending thirst for knowledge right

243
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:47,659
when you kinda look at something from
one angle and you like to do this and

244
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:52,499
let me just a little bit more and I made
it through this you know me will break

245
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,690
something and let me see if I can get
further

246
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,690
that that's a part of what we are that's
a part of what these kids have incited

247
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,060
them and that's what we're trying to
nurture appropriately so nobody nobody

248
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:09,210
else but tires have that symbol on their
badge you can't see it but even my badge

249
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,060
doesn't have it on so why and where
hacker kids right there's other

250
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,510
conferences out there for kids such as
the roots asylum probably know to step

251
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,480
on kids which is kind of one of the
other catalysts for us morning we do

252
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,770
have kids and catalyst

253
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,050
like forrest was DEFCON and told him the
way there was a kid that was there that

254
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,700
was doing soldering he's like I wanna go
but do I really want to bring my son

255
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,810
with me it was like eight years old to
DEFCON kids which don't take that the

256
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,620
wrong way it's late I'm working a booth
I'm out with people drinking it's just

257
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,180
not the appropriate thing as a parent
for me to bring him if I had a chaperone

258
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,980
that was willing to be there I think
that makes sense but I just wouldn't

259
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,330
want to subject him to the wrong days
short our lack of meals you know the 321

260
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,580
rule so these routes asylum which is
great their task the conference actually

261
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,340
Robert I got to get a walk through and
they have similar security protocols

262
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,470
were we were not left alone we did not
have a child to chaperone us so we had

263
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,870
an adult that was a part of their staff
walks around the venue in San Francisco

264
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,340
so that's in Vegas and then in san
Francisco has had kids actually

265
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,740
correction San Jose south of San
Francisco which is another great con but

266
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,590
they have one thing in common right west
coast piece so what about the rest of

267
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:38,090
the world we kind of like kids in West
Coast people flying to the west coast

268
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,450
with their kids to do this not everybody
can afford that so we're trying to bring

269
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,980
your kids to them

270
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,590
and with our limited resources we
started in Chicago then we went to

271
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,720
Indianapolis then we went to brussels
thanks to brew Khan who really kinda

272
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,390
sponsored everything which was fantastic
and now we're here today so if you have

273
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,419
been even kinda like an inkling inside
of you like hey you know what we want in

274
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:06,919
Dallas we will want in washingtonDC we
want one in anchorage alaska

275
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:13,200
ok you know let us know his be would
work with somebody to try and even do an

276
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,910
organization like have them organize it
there but we would help you wouldn't be

277
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,809
more like they go ahead would love to
get some money go figure it out now we

278
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:29,460
want to help you help them be successful
so who are the people behind her kids or

279
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,590
how so here's some kind of the content
that we have so we have a speaking track

280
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:45,330
any age can submit to RCMP so whether
you're a 280 feel free we also have a

281
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,910
bunch of activity stations in this one
right here is the one that we mentioned

282
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:54,350
before building a popsicle stick this
kind of MacGyver thing right there doing

283
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,960
engineering but its popsicle sticks glue
gun rubber bands in a plastic spoon

284
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:07,540
build new weapon accountable we we do
workshops so I don't think he was doing

285
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,220
workshops there is a way that pen
testing one which was really very

286
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,330
successful and there's robert doing a
safe and secure online presentation

287
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,160
where again if you're not familiar with
that it just in summary it's teaching

288
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,809
them could password practices its
teaching them to be careful about what

289
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:31,330
you put in social media it's teaching an
anti bullying online so that we can go

290
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,450
back to the speaking a little bit so
here I don't you guys know rubin Paul he

291
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,230
was our very first keno ever so who more
appropriate than a nine year olds

292
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,100
deliver cybersecurity two kids then a
kid that's going and doing talks all

293
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,900
around the world about

294
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,030
cyber safety for kids so it's pretty
awesome to a very lucky to have him but

295
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,990
we've had other adults give great talks
people in their thirties talking about

296
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,060
when you know when we stopped going
outside to rate talk by johnnie

297
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,580
Christmas and happy kids so tomorrow
we're gonna be doing a bunch of

298
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,320
different things with the kids so these
activity stations are really designed to

299
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,620
be like 15 to 20 minutes something to
kind of stimulate their curiosity

300
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,970
all mainly stem base so this one is
again with building a popsicle stick but

301
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,770
we're also gonna do stuff with Python
coding we're gonna do the technology or

302
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,840
engineering we've got Snap Circuits for
electrical engineering

303
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,440
we're doing sumo box every time I say
that I get chills gonna be building

304
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,490
their own robot that can be battling
with another kids robot four points and

305
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,320
then whoever is in the pit the longest
and most points at the end of the day

306
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,340
it's a gift card

307
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,660
what a great incentive right kind of
going back to be saying before they're

308
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,790
wired to learn they want to do this but
what they're learning is building a

309
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:56,160
device and then they're testing their
device to withstand unexpected are

310
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:04,020
unknown at her store aggressive forces
which i think is pretty exciting so in

311
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,520
this damn station one of the things that
we did it we give him like a list of

312
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,330
stuff and appearing to scouting and they
want to learn more

313
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,240
they're working on this damn too bad we
have like you could see the real tears

314
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,740
in a blue circle they can also get
credit to that so there's like this

315
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,820
really nice overlap between what we're
doing and what they might also already

316
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,870
be doing in there something else other
workshops are we done besides dole faces

317
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:31,700
web app in testing tomorrow would do any
interest adults are like I want to go to

318
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,150
that it's essentially the whole unboxing
to getting the device online to getting

319
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,550
into the device and then hooking up a
robotics servo motor and in controlling

320
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:47,140
it having to do some tricks lot of fun
even colder here he wanted to build a

321
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,370
Minecraft server so are one of our first
workshops was gonna build a minecraft

322
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,820
server we want you to learn Linux Linux
building a minecraft server so that was

323
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,639
a second it was

324
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,179
developing the Linux skills and kind of
the process of installing an app on

325
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:10,200
Linux and then they got to play a lot of
other things that we do within the

326
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,019
activity stations have specifically this
one for Python it's really designed for

327
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:21,309
kids that have had no prior experience
with hello world wright supra statement

328
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:24,999
then it's getting input from standard
and then building on Indian doing

329
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:28,999
creating lists combining with so what
you go through the exercises then they

330
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:32,209
start to get challenges in these
challenges once they complete the

331
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:36,919
challenges they get credit or in entry
or into our drawing at the end of the

332
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,789
business card to get a hole punch and
then we will see their name on the back

333
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:44,959
and based on the number of hoping she
received then they can get that many

334
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:50,399
entries into the drawing for the prizes
for example are coming up to about

335
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:54,459
Taylor prices are for use another
challenge is eternal and then there's

336
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:58,229
the Fibonacci series which some adults
are still working on that one that are

337
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:04,139
helping us out but none of the kids but
it's fine the content goes up on our

338
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:09,450
website in our library so happy for kids
dot com HJK the number for k itz dot com

339
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,539
click on the library so there's kids are
you know who are curious about their own

340
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,709
minecraft server have other
presentations that we've done about

341
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,899
stuff they can absolutely go there and
see that content so everything that

342
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:27,639
we're doing this year once that's done
we're gonna uploaded to the website and

343
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:33,039
will be available for anyone as a
refresher or even something new to them

344
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,950
surprises we like that's what a lot of
money goes to running the conference

345
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,519
giving something the kids and giving out
these prizes so this year the grand

346
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,519
prize at the conference has been a
virtual minecraft sir to basically get a

347
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,159
Linux box in the cloud and then they can
go and code mod do whatever they want

348
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:54,950
we've been giving out some Snap Circuits
in the past get out some books called

349
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,799
pipeline for kids no such prices sponsor
so we've been able to give those out we

350
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,510
got a bunch of books for tomorrow

351
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,740
Arduino I mean low-powered platforms are
a lot of songs we teach them how to use

352
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,440
that in some of my crew though the Morse
code but then they can go and have one

353
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,820
of their own and go knows the DEC
darknet badges who's familiar with this

354
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:26,570
had earlier so Dec four Dec on darknet
is a competition and the darknet

355
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,870
competition is just a bunch of puzzles
it goes on its online puzzles is

356
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:37,390
building for purchasing this badge and
its R&D projects they take you through

357
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,580
soldering it so this is this is my bad I
got one for him so was really nice

358
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,560
bonding exercises for sharing the
soldering iron rebuild it out and then

359
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,370
these devices talk to one another when
their idol the Morse code messages

360
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,530
encrypted messages on the back you can
also try to decode that that because

361
00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:03,910
that's like 1838 votes are doing to do
the Nova it's also preloaded with a

362
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,810
sketch to be a TV begun so when the kids
heard that they could turn TV's often

363
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,820
Best Buy with this little tiny badge
they were thrilled they won't lose their

364
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,450
minds

365
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,980
his friend was really unhappy when he
didn't win 10 years but part of

366
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,690
character-building so how do we know for
successful well it's really hard to know

367
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,600
and we're trying we're trying to figure
out new ways so specifically things like

368
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:30,910
this

369
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,970
safe and secure online presentation
without getting some feedback directly

370
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,570
from individuals like hey somebody was
bullying me and you know the training

371
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,760
that you gave us help me we don't know
what we're just hoping that were being

372
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,880
successful other things our surveys so
we use services a way to get much more

373
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,520
empirical data back but it's only really
want to give it to us so in this

374
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,040
particular survey the question was how
many kids attended including this one in

375
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,730
the answers were 12 13 because we've
only had three so when I asked him

376
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,660
what does that mean you know how many
kids have actually attended ok that's

377
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,080
what the question I asked my wife and
this is not to defend my wife was just a

378
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,010
different perspective she thought it
meant how many kids are there we've had

379
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,620
actually people right in number four is
a hand for kids with them so it really

380
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,090
kind of threw the data off the way to
try to figure out how to normalize it

381
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,610
and that some of the challenges with
surveys surveys for anything my advice

382
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,670
to you is get other people to look at it
even some of these other sections like

383
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,460
for example this workshop the kids in
Chicago were only able to go to one

384
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,720
workshop but we gave the survey they
provided feedback for both so which one

385
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,230
did they go to because it was all
anonymous so now get the data is viewed

386
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,540
so we didn't know we did the best we
could but with some of that data I tried

387
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,390
to build an infographic and I'm not a
really good graphic designer so did my

388
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:58,940
best but here we have this data that we
can share in Chicago then we grew last

389
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,130
year we had kids but only really 38
showed up this year we had fifty three

390
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:10,510
kids and I think all showed up on the
breakdown between those who was 39 boys

391
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:18,780
14 girls of those fifty three kids 36
boys that was their first time ever

392
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,030
going to have four kids and
twelve-year-olds their very first time

393
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:28,480
going to happen kids whose first time
girl got a few pretty cool right stuff

394
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,480
so from their perspective as your
absorbing all this information and

395
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,800
meeting new people and seeing all the
cool stuff around they have the same

396
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:44,490
type of experience but really do things
that they want to know about two boys

397
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,400
two girls that was our second half for
kids and then one kid it was his third

398
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:53,440
guess that was kind of tricky for us

399
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,950
you do have a range of seven to 17 18 in
there were minor things going to get a

400
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,300
little interesting with insurance and
stuff like that so we arrested between

401
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,700
seven and 17

402
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,090
and it seems like you're sweet spot
between eight and 12 because the 13 to

403
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,650
17 range either we're not getting out to
the high schools and middle schools

404
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,200
early enough to kind of get on their
radar or they just might not be

405
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,070
interesting because they're doing cool
things like cyber patriot or mine or

406
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:24,390
something else so trying to figure out
how to get more into that teacher and

407
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,070
then we had some kids that were under
heat which we found some of them really

408
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,300
I kinda gravitated to the the activities
and others were just on the parents

409
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,240
device so it's a tough one

410
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,160
a little bit more insight so the only
activity stations the most popular

411
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,380
technology destruction village who
doesn't like taking it apart it's a lot

412
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,810
of fun but the one that was the most
attended lockpick village who remembers

413
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:54,140
popping their first block is a lot of
fun and you want to keep trying harder

414
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:01,220
and harder lots and you want to pick
more so the lockpick village 28 kids

415
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:08,830
attended of that list you could see that
there was well that were able to pop up

416
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:14,590
to five mins but one can only top five
things you can do anything else I think

417
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:19,330
that's pretty impressive that it never
popped the lock with 45 pins you got a

418
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,490
hidden talent hopefully those powers for
good and you

419
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,450
16 you could see that there were six
kids at all the way up to the sixteen

420
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,920
and one kid went in there and there's
really no gender real significance there

421
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,890
but just a girl or boy is it just
randomly and then of the cops you could

422
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:45,780
see that the 2009 kids were able to pick
their way out of interesting but only

423
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:52,500
one kid drop the cups and was undone I
don't know what their motivation was

424
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,900
there maybe they want to be like the
next houdini or something but that was

425
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,000
kind of an interesting piece of data to
share

426
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,330
under the network security activity
station that we did some basic had them

427
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,640
using Wireshark who had data going back
and forth there's a bunch of challenges

428
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,060
they have to learn how to read the
package which is actually kinda cool

429
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,990
also incensed by itself so nine kids
attended that station and then seven of

430
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:18,899
nine completed all the exercises and it
was a hidden file challenges to

431
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,060
basically had to find packets take them
to a link that was on our website which

432
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:29,379
had a hidden message and that it looks
like seven of those kids are seven of

433
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:35,669
nine where it was a challenge for kids
station 10 kids attended that station

434
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:43,120
and get 10 that actually got to exercise
3 and encounter bail it wasn't for them

435
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,399
or what have you

436
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,399
but then two of them got as far as the
second challenge the third challenges

437
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,750
series which none of them were able to
do so we're going to be that in there

438
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,790
just to kind of see if someone can do
that and that would actually pretty cool

439
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,220
maybe we should offer a price of the
first kid that can solve the G Series

440
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,380
challenging pipe on that

441
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,450
learn that day $25 gift card or
something

442
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:11,200
spider-man how cool this by Matt sound
yes the kids hey do you want to learn

443
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,690
some minor automatic substitution
ciphers Lee things can happen to

444
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,160
probably start to fall asleep like some
you are right now the idea is we want to

445
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,280
make it interesting and it's all about
context in kind of giving it to a

446
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:30,220
context that they care about my man I
give credit to Robert he came out he

447
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,840
comes over these great ideas

448
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,810
seems like there's like you had let's
call it and we do they think something

449
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,220
like even number theory

450
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:44,150
and in that two kids actually went as
far as proving the man that was not a

451
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,430
requirement but they loved the man so
much they want to fight for spruce who

452
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:57,099
likes doing truce but we found some kids
that do so in the TV via the technology

453
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:00,260
destruction 14 kids attended

454
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:08,550
identify of that five kids successfully
identify all seven components and it

455
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,530
looks like fourteen of the kids knew
what a capacitor was just kind of cool

456
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:19,869
so here at said according to some
comments on I'm gonna have you hear

457
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:27,180
directly from the mouths of babes so
crafty coder

458
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:36,080
well what I really like about it is
there's a ton of stuff to do and really

459
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:44,310
hard to get bored when you're doing this
stuff because it's you have a day do

460
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:52,780
everything and you can have completed
all so I that's really cool like that

461
00:36:52,780 --> 00:37:03,530
and I'd like that I think they like is a
lockpick village and technology stocks

462
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:10,560
in village because he delights in
showing technology that's like 45 bucks

463
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,880
you can't do at home

464
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,730
take this pic technology

465
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:27,359
where was she was like to go to Goodwill
and I spent like me $10 and by my son

466
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,900
three or four different things and let
it just sit there and take it apart and

467
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:42,260
then you sleepy waste recycling old from
it will be a good thing it like a new

468
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,640
Xbox

469
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:53,880
you can take a part of your toolkit
cardboard box it's really a lot last

470
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:01,520
question what do you think that I think
so we normally if you don't attend to

471
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,790
every single one that year which I don't
think a lot of kids are going to do one

472
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,670
year is a lot of time so you're probably
not forget a lot of stuff that you learn

473
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:17,920
that year but I think I could do is have
some things on a website or something

474
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,100
you can do at home to practice what you
learned it had four kids of the library

475
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:33,420
at like tutorial videos or something
like that which they do so as you know

476
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,080
crap decoders biologically related to me
but I thought we change it up a little

477
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,550
bit since he's here with us I thought
hearing from actual his perspective

478
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,950
would be much more valuable and
something I think you might want to

479
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,530
communicate versus just the Middle East
fatman continue talking about how cool

480
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,470
her kids is any time you want I love
self-deprecating

481
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,330
deprecating humor so just kind of
finishing off the journey up the

482
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,740
mountain Hector did you guys got a
better sense of who we are what we doing

483
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,490
what our mission is and the rise that
we're trying to change an impact last

484
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:12,840
story since again nobody gets paid the
way we get actual like the gratification

485
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,890
of what I just call it a day

486
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:21,210
is when we find out that one of the
Tyros discovered something new

487
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,250
not just use new technology but knew
about themselves and their parents

488
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,549
didn't know about it as a continued to
talk about this I keep getting chills

489
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,769
for example in Indianapolis

490
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:38,539
14 year old boy hehe came in their dad
drop them off and do some stuff in here

491
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:44,190
I'm gonna toss in some talks have a nice
day what time should I pick them up and

492
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:50,950
sat down and right there was a crypto
station never done crippled before you

493
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,849
start going through some binary
conversions and B 64 rotation 13 and

494
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:00,150
some other stuff where r 13 and some
other stuff that we had and he loved it

495
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,980
we go to lunch we came back a little Lee
he was standing in front of the room was

496
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,589
locked for a half hour waiting for us to
come back and then he continued and he

497
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:13,809
had lied about he challenged I'm not
leaving until I get all of these he did

498
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:19,910
nothing else except crypto when I
started talk to his dad through email

499
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,539
because you know you gonna do in Chicago
to my son wants to go you guys gonna be

500
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:27,799
challenges I go we use the dad of the
kid that was like they are all day to ya

501
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:36,500
never seen a kid gravitate to crypto for
so long and discover inside of

502
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,680
themselves that passion for wanting to
do analysis and he goes really has he

503
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,420
told me he was there and that he liked
it and that was about the extent of the

504
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,309
conversation I said you gotta go further
with this there's something inside him

505
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:53,089
that really needs to be explored and he
will thanks a lot we do really

506
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:56,549
appreciate you know you guys introducing
the same keep doing the great stuff that

507
00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:00,480
you're doing and that's how is the
painting that's the point where we've

508
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,690
realized that with his one person we may
have changed not just his life but his

509
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,420
parent's perspective of him right cause
your parents your biggest critics cite

510
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,570
from their spouse and then that's
another

511
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,480
but then when you get that third party
confirmation maybe hopefully like he

512
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,030
might be like the next great arielle
kebbel right he might come up with some

513
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,110
great algorithm that starts to protect
the right of our data or he figures out

514
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,670
how to break certain codes to save lives
and we don't know but hopefully we make

515
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,420
a difference so with that I do want to
thank everybody for sticking through

don't talk about myself at all during

518
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,290
this cuz I'm completely irrelevant
compared to what we're doing and I do
