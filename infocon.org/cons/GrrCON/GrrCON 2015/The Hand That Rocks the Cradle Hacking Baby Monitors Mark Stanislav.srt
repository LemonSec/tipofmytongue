00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
good afternoon i'm mark stanislav I work
at rapid seven if you can tell by the

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,260
slide template and so today's talk is
about research I did for about seven or

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:15,320
eight months on nine different baby
monitors so these are not RAF base these

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,350
are not just new waves of VOCs are one
they're happy for our wifi and what you

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,449
actually talk to them over the internet
so the there's a little ambiguity I

6
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:27,550
think when I put the title in four work
on its not a generic baby monitors these

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,880
are all interconnected one so if you're
a fan of CSI cyber I personally know

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,579
touch touch the stuff now my nothing I
can price stomach to watch but I was

9
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:44,379
told very quickly after by my PR
director journalist she proudly

10
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:49,149
enforcing watched that show and found
out that the first episode currently

11
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,420
have something to do with connected baby
monitors and hacking them and I saw it

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,440
never seemed upset but that's what I
hear and then Dave I tell if you're if

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,059
you know it all day

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,400
the daily Dave mailing list or anything
like that you know Davis but he's got

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,540
some thoughts on junk hacking and what
that means and what we're doing an IOT

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,590
and research right now but to say the
least

17
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,000
CSI cyber fucked everything up so but
aside from you know bad she shows and

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,580
and sixty people about you know
different research projects we do have

19
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,729
some valuable things to contribute here
right which is people buy these things

20
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,970
and they're in people's homes and they
see you and hear you and you know when

21
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,150
you're having your kid and bring it home
for the first day you probably have a

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,960
baby monitor and a lot of these ones on
the market now have internet

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,540
connectivity whether or not you nestle
12 its kind of the status quo the bacon

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,360
principle of everything's better with
bacon everything's better with Bluetooth

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,979
and wi-fi and ZigBee and z-wave and on
and on so you know these these are real

26
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,740
things the the screen shot to the right
is actually

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,369
message I got from my mother-in-law who
is going to purchase literally one of

28
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,720
the devices you'll see today with the
ability I found for baby shower that she

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,060
was going to be very practical value
here in the date down there that you

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,519
know every week two weeks you'll see
another story like this somewhere around

31
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,840
the world of some some jury on the
Internet yelling at a kid or yelling at

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,900
a nanny or whatever you know those those
are all like well and good and knowing

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,459
but slightly more riskier than just
people getting yelled at on the internet

34
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,340
so what are these devices have your
typical are off base ones have actually

35
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:40,220
live features if you are a parent or or
have been to a niece or nephew home with

36
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,830
one of your relatives you've probably
seen these devices in a really cool like

37
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,930
fully-featured right

38
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,370
full-color display as they have
temperature monitoring humidity

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,530
monitoring motion sensors all the stuff
and these are not even

40
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,450
internet-connected ones so
interconnected ones have all those

41
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,489
features plus you can do things like
offload the video so let's say there's a

42
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,730
motion alert in the room or on the room
alexi take a 30 second segment of that

43
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,930
upload it wherever and then on your
smartphone you can book the clips he

44
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,480
like over to my baby wake up because
something happened or did you just wake

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,579
up for a second juror I go back to sleep
not actually kept in check on her

46
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,010
physically cuz I'm lazy so you have
pictures like that you have features

47
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,769
like you can upload music to the baby
monitor play music through it all kinds

48
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,940
of interesting features it's really
might not be something that every parent

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,950
needs but as we know whether or not you
want an internet-connected device pretty

50
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,630
much everything you buy a TV or blu-ray
player right these all have internet

51
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,829
capabilities these days it's just kind
of the status quo now the problem here

52
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,870
and I've been doing research for a few
years now and see this over and over so

53
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,630
while the stock is certainly on live TV
monitors don't for a second think that

54
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,660
this doesn't represent consumer IOT in
general these are all different vendors

55
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,239
wanna talk about these are all different
platforms are built on this is this is

56
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,720
more like a case study

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,660
in terms of what I heard he looks like
both consumer a lot of business

58
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,430
applications of irish you as well as a
lot of overlap there so we see one big

59
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,170
area of failure is the supply chain we
have chipsets that come from random you

60
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,459
know Taiwanese manufacturers and they
come with firmware that have prompted

61
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,040
software kernels and you know libraries
that haven't been updated for five or 10

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,960
years as we'll see later and these kinds
of devices are not being like hard in at

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,820
the start and so when the supply chain
components you put them together as the

64
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,430
vendor you are sooo mean that you're up
streams are taking care of security us'

65
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,350
the vendor or not maybe experts and
security who maybe aren't experts in

66
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,470
wireless security so you're trusting
your vendors to do the due diligence for

67
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,730
you and it's completely flawed model
right now because the up streams are not

68
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,530
doing that for components and so we end
up with is a device with multiple

69
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,520
vendors in the splash Shane and one big
device of a lot of failures

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,480
the other thing is when we have entirety
device the benefit and the terror of IMG

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,710
is that there are a lot of components to
make it I don't mean like this I mean

72
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,270
like technological components so short
list but you're being mobile app spot

73
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,530
services back and services like actual
like one on the device itself web apps

74
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,400
firmware hardware network protocols
wireless-n crypto that's a that's a

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,260
pretty shirtless really answer the
question is as a vendor are you going to

76
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,510
be an expert in every single last one of
this not a chance even if you go to a

77
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,229
third party like a security firm are
they gonna be experts in every single

78
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:43,820
one of this not probably not a chance so
what happens is maybe you have a really

79
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,930
good developer in Python and staff are
you have a really good you know wireless

80
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,930
expert well someone's gonna strip the
mobile app someone's gonna strip the API

81
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,030
so much going to skip the cloud service
integrations or the SDK there's going to

82
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,430
be an area where you are not proficient
at and you're gonna fail and that's

83
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,169
where researchers come in and we find
this terrible stuff

84
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:09,870
and then overall I would see in this is
something that's slowly changing and

85
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,620
there's some cool initiatives underway
to get there but overall like the

86
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,300
frameworks the standards protocols for
what I would tease using is completely

87
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,469
undefined right now there are some
people that are trying to you know big

88
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:26,050
companies like Cisco Small organizations
like online trust Alliance

89
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,800
there are efforts under way to you give
some sanity to what I would he is but

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,740
right now it's kind of wild wild west
out there we don't really have a firm

91
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,259
grounding of what I would you should
look like how should be secured an

92
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,069
intermediate have really have a playbook
to work from there's gonna be a lot of

93
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:48,180
missteps so kind of briefly I just wanna
go over it you know one of things in and

94
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,169
talks like this that I think it lost is
the the the new on so how do you

95
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,430
actually do this research and I think
that's a more interesting part for a lot

96
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,330
of you in the room maybe you want to get
into hardware hacking maybe you want to

97
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,620
get into research there are hundreds of
thousands of IOT devices and a lot of

98
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,490
them are pretty cheap so if you want to
get into the space you can go to BestBuy

99
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,500
and buy something off the shelf for 50
bucks and then apply these kinds of

100
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,319
techniques and do your own research and
you know do a talk like this that we

101
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,089
come to and no one really good example
of the easiest ways to start going after

102
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:23,629
software is to go after the actual
firmware now from where we think of

103
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:28,229
maybe twenty years ago today from work
today is basically just a Linux OS on a

104
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:34,139
flash that's when it that's what
firmware is the modern definition and so

105
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,229
they're actually these chip the dismal

106
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:42,399
outlining integrated circuit so so it
for sure I guess and these these chips

107
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,490
often are flash packages and you know
they can be in a variety of you know

108
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,219
size of megabits megabytes and the
overall / will actually have your tire

109
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,810
Linux operating system you'll have your
entire filesystem all your good stop all

110
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,229
your binaries all your config files and
I've seen other talks where they're like

111
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:06,159
oh so all you do is decide to take the
chip off and try not to ruin it you

112
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,919
don't have to do any of that you can get
this thing called a Pomona clip which is

113
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,719
just the the vendor that makes these
clips they attach directly hooked up to

114
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,260
a bus tires sugar or something else that
can speak spy SPI

115
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,770
and just what you're dumping firmware
off in in a heartbeat with flash ROM so

116
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,110
this isn't hard life you can like use a
screwdriver and open up a case you can

117
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,870
probably hook a clip on and hit flash
ROM and a couple of parameters and you

118
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,030
got from where once you have the
firmware a lot of good stuff happens

119
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,150
right you have all the binaries you can
start reversing you have all the config

120
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,120
files all the web ass you have a lot of
good attack surface it go from just from

121
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,950
doing that one stop other other means of
course brute forcing of various ill so

122
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,580
let's say we get the firmware there's a
shadow file on there with some

123
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,750
credentials assume believe really rude
and some other privileged accounts for a

124
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,590
through CUDA hash hash Katsav and you
maybe get some backdoor passwords

125
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,560
because a lot of these devices have
hardcoded backdoor passwords very common

126
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,230
and then Google because some of these
things have cloudy flies that's what a

127
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,260
lot of times you have a random API that
you find in reversing a mobile app

128
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,670
refine an API to binary that buying that
API host might actually be getting

129
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,730
indexed in Google like some of the
screenshot you see up there we're

130
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,880
texting putting consumer data directly
into Google cash right so kinda

131
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,220
interesting what you can find if you
know what what host names you're looking

132
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,480
for and then we have console so you
aren't is pretty much the defacto way

133
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,020
you're gonna 20 consoles and embedded
hardware these days and that's really

134
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,810
fucking dark and so do the same bunch of
ways anything that speaks you know you

135
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,680
are aiming at speaks rs232 type you know
serial interfaces JTAG you later which

136
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,760
people use only used for JTAG
enumeration actually has a hole you are

137
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,780
an aberration as well and then you can
talk to you are over it which is cool

138
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,430
cool thing about having this is you have
an embedded device that has no GA pori

139
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:03,050
has no no USB port 443 boards right
embedded hardware what this effectively

140
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,210
gives you is gives you a mouse or
keyboard and monitor on embedded

141
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,640
hardware effectively time that's what a
serial console basically gives you so

142
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,970
you sometimes get lucky and there's no
credentials whatsoever you just get

143
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,380
dropped to a root shell other times you
have a credential but then you can go to

144
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,080
like you which is the bootloader you'll
see very often

145
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,090
and that bootloader you can just you
know hit one into the boot cards and

146
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,300
guess what you dropped a single user
mode now your route now you can change

147
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,810
the password and login and do everything
the way you want to do it a lot of cool

148
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,760
things you can do you want to have your
console access if you want to get more

149
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,160
involved and you don't have maybe you
don't have the luxury of having a

150
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,720
manipulates case with the final
arguments which does happen sometimes be

151
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,450
hard code the kernel arguments and don't
let you kinda manipulate those you can

152
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,850
use JTAG JTAG basically speaking at the
lowest level of her communication you'll

153
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,790
probably ever get through some sort of
interface like this and what's called a

154
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,650
JTAG it really doesn't limit what you
can do it's a little finicky in what how

155
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,070
you do it but it really doesn't limit
you what you can do you know a couple of

156
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,470
examples where you can you JTAG one is
and I've done this before them this

157
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,500
device that's not a very minor but
useful for this screen shot anyways here

158
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,340
is you can dump live memory so you can
hook up GB of memory and so all the

159
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,960
stuff in memory maybe its session keys
maybe its credentials maybe its API

160
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,800
endpoints you can dump all mister JTAC
even if you can't log into the device

161
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,210
you're taking live memory out of it the
only thing you can do is manipulate

162
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,900
memory so let's say you stop you
actually kill execution of this device

163
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,580
as its booting up the kernel you can
actually manipulate the bytes of memory

164
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,010
to overwrite those hard coded kernel
parameters and actually still single

165
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,620
user mode the device even if it was
supposed to not like you a ton of power

166
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,820
not the easiest thing to work with but
sometimes you get lucky with what you

167
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,400
need you

168
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,210
mobile applications are the best thing
out there right now for any kind of a TV

169
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:07,220
person and security because everyone
makes terrible but blass like everyone

170
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,400
just makes terrible mobile apps whether
it's hard code the URLs to firmware

171
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,090
which sits at home like jumping flash
thing you see a bunch of API calls that

172
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,100
very often don't u certificate pending
so you'd you man in the middle that has

173
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,710
to sell traffic or half the time
honestly just clear text traffic already

174
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,260
you know decrypt binaries with something
like clutch Ryo s you know use use job

175
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,400
or text ajar go to you know get our
Android there's a lot of easy way is and

176
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,280
so many interesting things so which will
talk about our are in those basic

177
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,960
network analysis Wireshark and map news
no surprise there

178
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,730
web apps the back-end web apps for the
actual hardware and you'll save a lot

179
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,780
cloud services so that the first
screenshot is a cross-site scripting on

180
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,480
the on the website that logs you into
the cloud service to talk to the camera

181
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,250
right so anything you can think about
with cross site scripting hijacking

182
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,840
sections you know you know whatever you
want to do sometimes you get lucky lucky

183
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,320
and steel session cookies and whatever
in the back and back and websites pretty

184
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,590
obvious so that's some of the techniques
that's not exhaustive list but hopefully

185
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,040
if you've been thinking about getting
into this kind of space

186
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,700
those are some great techniques to look
into in the hardware and software is

187
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:27,070
either cheaper for you so crazy so they
mars themselves just to give you a sense

188
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:33,300
these are nine different cameras across
eight vendors and the price points range

189
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:41,220
from 60 55 bucks to $260 so a lot of
vendors lot of price points different

190
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,970
feature sets I really wanted to have
like I said a case study I wanna I don't

191
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,470
want to be like oh what are like the
lowest common denominator cameras on the

192
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,060
market

193
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,400
how secure they I want to see like kind
of a range of vendors and price points

194
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,110
so this talk a whole white paper we've
been webinars on this research there's

195
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,760
actually more content than Wall get you
today when I kinda wanna play out today

196
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,440
is a broad view of the kinds of things
you find when you do your research so

197
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,060
some of these are not bug some of these
are just like funny shit that I thought

198
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,760
was interesting for a talk other things
are bugs and are bugs but not really

199
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,940
vulnerabilities if you want to draw that
line and then there are definitely

200
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,440
vulnerabilities that will get to an end
of ramp up from like funny to like crap

201
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,150
really quickly so we'll we'll get there
hang in there you're getting tired first

202
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,130
one we things which popular brand new
things that baton of devices

203
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,870
this camera which i think was on the
higher end of the price points 1 really

204
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,610
important thing with IOT is they are
consumer electronics don't have human

205
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,670
interfaces on the devices natively so
just what we use we almost always use a

206
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,450
mobile app for mobile app is our
lifeline for controlling these devices

207
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,560
other than employing the device and so
this is a camera where it has a feature

208
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,770
specifically that says baby monitoring
is disabled the screen goes blank on

209
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,650
your mobile app it says its disabled for
just one if you met in the middle the

210
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,350
traffic you found the RTMP stream that's
live and that RTMP stream is still alive

211
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,200
after disable the camera it's still
streaming video you can still watch

212
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,450
video real time so if you as a parent or
whatever you're like hey whatever is

213
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,650
about to happen you choose your own
adventure on that one

214
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,820
this camera offer you know half hour
would guess what is on your network

215
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,540
they're still watching the stream with
you you think you've disabled that you

216
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,210
have not so good example of a bug
vulnerability you can you know that one

217
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,810
yourself but certainly a bug in some
that shouldn't happen and people trust

218
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,240
the mobile app to tell them what's
happening this is an example that trust

219
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,830
fail this one's a little bit confusing
Sawtry step through as as best I can

220
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,020
so we've got a we did extra jar we have
some job of that represents the mobile

221
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,310
app for this device we look through it
we find this method called Andy

222
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,020
five-hour session which sounds super
sections sexy and fun we start looking

223
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,060
at it and we see this method

224
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,590
am drunk and I'm not a huge job
developer but I've never heard of em

225
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,230
drunk before I was like I don't know
this is let me look for the code base

226
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,460
and shit you know sure enough there is a
method that's the fine and so what it

227
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,960
does is basically there's this empty
five how's that going to get created the

228
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,740
first part of an email address for the
quarter the company the next part is

229
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,610
like you know the string and then
there's a primer string at the very end

230
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:29,460
so if you look at towards the top screen
shot toward the right side of it like 99

231
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,300
m chunk 60,000 whatever so what this is
doing if you look at the second

232
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,390
screenshot is there just like for loop
and it's gonna take its gonna take that

233
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,360
number and do some math in like subtract
and subtract and subtract do this math

234
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,260
and basically all its gonna do is
obvious Kate that password or that the

235
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,339
core part of the password that is now
becoming IMG five straight right it's an

236
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,990
obfuscation routine to hide the stuff in
the code for fun fact there's actually a

237
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,180
return statement at the top of the for
loop so all the obfuscation stuff you

238
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,600
see at the very bottom is not even being
hit so we have this issue that's not

239
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,260
actually obvious getting anything and
now whether that was a final decision by

240
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,400
the developer whether it was like oh oh
crap I forgot you like to return

241
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,280
statement up during debug we don't know
why it happened but we do know is that

242
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,329
clearly developer was going to obfuscate
it and then didn't for one of many

243
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,079
reasons and this is the kind of stuff
that you will only see violate going

244
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,510
through mobile after going through
binaries stepping through them you know

245
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,390
best effort the compilation and looking
through these things and actually

246
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,669
understanding of what might have
happened there and why wifi baby the

247
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:39,190
highest price camera one of the worst
cameras in terms of usage and quality

248
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,309
and everything else but a couple of
weird things and again not bugs just

249
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,230
really things that shouldn't happen

250
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,880
good example of information disclosure
every single HTTP endpoint of this

251
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,280
camera has authentication except for a
log file and this camera actually is one

252
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,210
camera that actually does UPnP so it's
actually gonna expose itself over the

253
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,140
internet with a dying DNS address so
this is gonna be on the internet and we

254
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,580
have things like log files and he's like
files guess what get indexed in Google

255
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,860
sometimes and then we see things like
RTMP and points he knows what kind of

256
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,470
debug info will potentials will dump you
know internal external IP addresses

257
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,750
you know we don't know what's going to
happen and this is a good example where

258
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,679
they spent a lot time protecting the
webserver except for the thing that

259
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,559
gives a ton of detail and info about the
web server that might be useful to an

260
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,540
attack on the outside another example of
this is a very common for a common theme

261
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,419
that will see through other examples
there was an SSL cert on this device the

262
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:41,299
SSL cert was hard to the private view is
hardcoded this is not something that

263
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,230
gets generated when the device boots off
it's not unique but even though it

264
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,720
supports us alan has a solid bad
implementation this device doesn't use

265
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,360
us all everything you do this device is
clear tax and this is you know this is a

266
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,800
2015 camera literally a model number has
2015 it so if we're all like oh yeah

267
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,620
I'll tell us so yeah we should be doing
like to sell her tillis 12 now and get

268
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,470
rid of us all three these cameras do not
even talk as a cell let alone like a

269
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:17,130
good virginity less anymore right so we
have devices 2015 $260 baby monitors

270
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,990
that don't even encrypt 80 this is the
state of affairs right now as a better

271
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:31,130
example of another point of $206 cameras
and IOT and baby monitor UPnP remote

272
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,970
code execution bugs from 2012 CBS 10

273
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,390
likely gonna mess plate right now you'll
see you'll find targets for the for

274
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:45,679
these bugs these bugs in a brand new
device off the shelf 2015 model still

275
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:52,929
have CBS 10 remote code execution by the
spring 2012 right so when you think

276
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,330
about like oh I call back to these
devices really be some bugs this has

277
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,440
like a direct you own the camera and
again this camera sits on the internet

278
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,580
UPnP you have direct you literally
direct connect dropped you know drop

279
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,059
some fancy assembly and just what you're
you're on a camera now and June code

280
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:14,700
execution when speaker view this is a
piece of shit you can tell because it

281
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,580
looks like a piece of shit at $60 that's
another good indicator

282
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,550
funny thing I found it there is what I
was doing in your packet captures like I

283
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,110
do for all these devices I saw FTP data
like FTP that's weird like was it

284
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,270
gradually firmware like some random
thing they should be doing anyways or

285
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,480
FTP it turns out every single camera is
given FTP credentials that are unique to

286
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,780
that camera and there's this e-mail
configuration file that gets uploaded

287
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,409
that's completely blank and I didn't see
a way to add data to the like through

288
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,190
the user interface right to actually use
so you basically have free cloud storage

289
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,679
right you have an FTP server own with
your own credentials on this camera and

290
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,049
you can just upload stuff as you want so
if you wanna run away or server whatever

291
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:55,850
you need to do

292
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:01,370
plenty plenty of free storage back we'll
see this as a common theme I don't talk

293
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,220
about every tragedy found but some
examples without config good news is the

294
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,820
admin admin default login you can
actually change that one bad news is you

295
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,520
cannot change the user user guest guest
login and of course the user user login

296
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,289
lets you view the camera it's all over
clear text anyways so you can see your

297
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:21,750
credentials even if you didn't know them
before if your packet sniffing kind of

298
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,870
all hope is lost

299
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,039
there was a default admin password in
this example the admin password actually

300
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,710
a root password because of the file
system configuration again hardcoded

301
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:37,330
root password you know six characters
alphanumeric no no big deal to craft so

302
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,679
again we'll see more of that kind of
thing

303
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,330
this is a great example of how badly or
not encrypting so these are four

304
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,559
different screenshots for four different
interfaces of this one camera we have to

305
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:57,230
cloud providers and true local weather
application servers none of them are all

306
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,630
of its clear tax all the registration
for your account all the credentials

307
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,380
everything is clear text over the wire
whether it's internet based on your

308
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,559
local land so if you were kind of on the
fence and whether or not something crypt

309
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:15,620
it's not such a couple of things at once
actually story tactic they've as far as

310
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,120
I'm aware they have this one but try not
actually had a cross-site scripting

311
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,390
vulnerability in the again the
authentication area for this actual

312
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,990
camera can login and actually the camera
on a web service versus like a mobile

313
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,679
app aside from the fact all clear text
to begin with if you have crisis you

314
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,950
have crisis gripping you can you know
jack you take take your Donbass attack

315
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,630
and go go wild so not a great thing to
see really good fishing campaign

316
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:47,679
opportunity right good news is this
camera used to have tell enabled by

317
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,870
default does not have enabled by default
the problem is it still has Thomas and

318
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,140
one of the things that we talked about
is whether it's like as researcher or I

319
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,480
might not work with vendors like
professionally for work as well

320
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,450
and I'm like hey if you don't do that by
if you don't have that service you

321
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,710
should get it off the file system right
because if I can find a script or a bug

322
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,870
or code execution or something I can go
from having like some weird PHP like

323
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,690
localize PHP things sandbox 1000 guess
what like 80% and now I'm ringtone again

324
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,520
so you should try to restrict its not
gonna solve all your problems but you

325
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,090
should you should make it easier on the
attacker than it already is which is

326
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,030
pretty easy

327
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,070
still the interesting thing is they
disable telnet but they still left a

328
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,890
username root password right on the
camera so you can do this you are if you

329
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,490
wanna do physical access text off which
is more in my opinion but the more

330
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,060
important partners again if you can
enable telnet you now have a default

331
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,640
credentials to login as root on so kind
of cascades of all abilities and

332
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:53,070
concerns IBM for yes this is one of two
IP cameras will talk about so we see

333
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:59,040
very quickly throughout just a and maps
can 423 is open were like ok cool tell

334
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,390
me and you know you don't even need to
try to dump the firmware if you're in a

335
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,820
gas passwords writer and you like root
admin admin admin admin 123 right so we

336
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,620
during this research of course I did
that and I login as admin admin on

337
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,980
telnet and effectively again read on
this device is only one account admin

338
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,230
account but once I get on there I start
looking around and the first thing I see

339
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:29,330
is a look at the password file not
shadow your password one indicator that

340
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,610
something about to go wrong number to
that song is about to go wrong is if you

341
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,820
look at the actual hash at the at the
bottom there after the admin colon

342
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,620
that's the actual hash that is very
clearly based on the size and there's no

343
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,220
leading salter anything it's very
clearly desk risks does kurt has been

344
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,010
like gone or should have been gone for
like 15 years now at the very least so

345
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,870
to really quick indicators telling that
enabled at the password and then and

346
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,180
then does script

347
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,110
so if you look a little closer

348
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,100
you've got you boot from 2005 openness
assault from 2007 which is so old it's

349
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,140
not even affected by heart bleed so
that's kind of actually benefit of

350
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,190
security has a Linux kernel from 2007
which god only knows how many local root

351
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,470
exploit there are a number of the above
like like a hundred and you'll probably

352
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,040
correct busybox 2008 and of course you
can tell you know strips again this is

353
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,020
the most current software for one of the
most popular baby monitors on you know

354
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,660
being sold today and it's burning
software from two thousand and $500 so

355
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,830
one of the questions I was asked a lot
during like things about this stuff and

356
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:47,510
some other talks was oh did you see a
relationship between cost and security

357
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,930
the answer is absolutely not that the
highest in Cameron the loss and camera

358
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,370
they'll socks as you will come to find
out sooner than later

359
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,930
encryption this was the only camera I
believe that did that for all video

360
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,220
transmission video audio transmission
and their different ways you can have

361
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,100
live video you have dressed like clips
right so this was the only device that

362
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,770
actually encrypted all the video and
audio over the wire two things one is it

363
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,230
used

364
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,790
X 60 which unless you like done at Xbox
hacking back in the day I have no idea

365
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,730
what I sixty years as a cipher this is
not something that you probably dealt

366
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,530
with heard of maybe or maybe you have
but most people haven't so kind of your

367
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,050
choice and not necessarily the worst
thing in the world to use but also not a

368
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,680
great choice at the very top and this is
another good example we're going through

369
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,050
the mobile app and looking at code and
try to understand binary is good we see

370
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,830
that there's a backup function on this
camera and then when we look through

371
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:47,010
some of the methods it calls a calls
this you know just kind of stock AES 256

372
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,049
encryption thing which is ok as 256 good
for you

373
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:56,869
but hard codes the passphrase for the
age of 56 are asked to 56 it also use

374
00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:01,259
the ECB mode which is again a crypto
thing that you care about but overall

375
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:04,840
it's one of those things if you ever
find a big dump if you ever they get

376
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,970
indexed on Google someone leaks data
there's a bug that lets you export

377
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:14,039
encrypted backup pick pick your pick
this one this one pass phrase will

378
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:19,940
unlock all the credentials all the
config details everything alright this

379
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:28,749
is where we start ramping up some of the
really really bad stuff so IBM six again

380
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:34,869
IDB couple another a few examples of
terrible no crypto so they have this web

381
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:39,389
interface which will talk about more
second no crypto for login whatever else

382
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:43,609
for administration all the API calls for
the mobile app completely unencrypted

383
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:47,220
and also running time that with your
credentials so are you getting a

384
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:54,369
recurring theme in on some of the stuff
why this website importance is if you

385
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,730
look at the left side and right side
like you see they're very clearly a

386
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,970
problem that you cannot happen so that
that error output that exception handler

387
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,679
for not being called hashing function
wherever it's up there that you cannot

388
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:13,249
happen and before that happened we had
this so very sad that there's no way I

389
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:19,559
see on the screen resolutions terrible
the top that the top 1 vs proper account

390
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,649
is Mark . stanislav @ gmail.com the
attacker account is Mark stanislav no no

391
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,210
dot appearing in the middle

392
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,330
@ gmail.com if you're familiar with how
a lot of email works the actual period

393
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,779
44 Gmail doesn't matter if it doesn't
it's it's the same account you can

394
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:39,340
transfer to different counts for so
what's really easy and you can you like

395
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:45,580
+ water + through or + Bartle Doo same
thing but for testing purposes these

396
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,619
accounts are completely different right
when you sign up for it with an email

397
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:51,850
address that the complete unique
identifier for that account so I sent

398
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,340
her to accounts one account attached to
the camera the other counts for testing

399
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,450
in the background and foreground you can
see the same stream

400
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,200
why that's a problem is because only the
proper account is attached to the camera

401
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,660
the attacker account is not attach the
camera and in the parlance of our

402
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,640
industry we call this a direct object
reference where you basically put in the

403
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,320
object I D and it doesn't actually do
authorization check for the object aidid

404
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,760
you're looking at this is like the weave
case right with AT&T data so I go to the

405
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,690
serial number of this device which is
the literal serial number that 4106 a

406
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,020
senior whatever it says very small key
space obviously and it's against your

407
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,290
number so you can guess how that number
is created and so once you're in there

408
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,690
really ok there's some basic info like
some of that stuff might be entrust teen

409
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:46,590
whatever data but there's this tabular
information and other information is

410
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,800
kind of interesting because it like I
went here I was like Oh weird like

411
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,490
there's all these broken screen shots
maybe the site doesn't work anymore

412
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,670
maybe it's broken or whatever

413
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,590
well I look together like actually those
are alert don't like those are alert I

414
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,070
made like I remember those timestamps I
remember testing the camera I know those

415
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,810
are actual earth-like so whatever the
screenshots doing is not really relevant

416
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,320
so when you look at the HTML you look at
the screen shot of course is linked and

417
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,030
the link is an AVI file name well you
get the AVI file name you man the middle

418
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:22,190
of the mobile traffic and mobile traffic
has god this is terrible looking you

419
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,760
have mobile traffic that has an Amazon
s3 bucket the amount Amazon s3 bucket is

420
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,320
one bucket for all accounts it has the
actual cell number in the in the actual

421
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,210
URL you change the cell number you go to
the web page changes your number you

422
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,150
enumerate every single video for every
single camera you appended to this

423
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,650
bucket with the cell number in place for
the right one and you can literally

424
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,880
steal every single alert video from
every camera ever treated so every time

425
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,290
there's a motion in the room every time
there's a sound in the room and record

426
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:59,260
the 32nd default clip that you may or
may not look at you may or may not ever

427
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,050
delete they might just happen you never
know they actually happening this data

428
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:09,140
is all for the taking with one direct
object reference vulnerability so as you

429
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,550
can imagine that kind of a big deal
because while maybe you like snoop on a

430
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,590
camera and maybe someone in the room or
maybe someone's talking these video

431
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,390
clips are literally guaranteeing you for
some sort of activity right there they

432
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,720
can only be recorded because a loud
noise or because of motion here pretty

433
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,110
much guaranteed as an attacker to get
like a treasure trove of people's

434
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:34,170
personal lives kind of a big deal also
known these URLs are signed with a three

435
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,550
buckets can be signed in should be
should be signed

436
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,130
none of the data it's actually
downloading through your mobile apps

437
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,910
even encrypted there's no HTTPS being
used at all and the video clips are not

438
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,340
encrypted wonder uploaded so as soon as
you know the URL you can go the oral no

439
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,950
authentication no signature no token
just hit the URL download text done and

440
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,740
again every single customer and this
camera is the number one selling ho chi

441
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,250
camera on Amazon

442
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,570
couple other things again

443
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,350
fun things for a DePuy no different for
different folks that the one being

444
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,960
there's a hidden wiki for this service
for some reason within a password I'm

445
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,790
sure super just awesome insecure can
never be fished and then there's an

446
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,740
entire admin backend for this service so
again go to have a calm right and

447
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,840
hopefully maybe get an employee's
password

448
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,580
these are not things that should be
exposed to public Internet right like

449
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,510
these should be somewhere on your like
controlled internal network interface I

450
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:34,350
can just hit on the website and brute
force against your credentials to log

451
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:39,150
into so this example this camera we've
got stealing all data from every camera

452
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,980
that's ever been recorded we move along
to the film since I camera which I

453
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,750
should say Phillips was an amazing
company work with for disclosure we

454
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:52,050
don't get a say that a lot in the
security industry so props to them and

455
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:59,470
the team fun facts again I did research
in 2013 on a chemical dyes on my talk

456
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,400
your few years back and so the eyes on
like I didn't want research and

457
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,660
following this bad shit and whatever so
when I start looking inside camera just

458
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,020
what the firmware is the same firmware
the heart was the same hardware it's

459
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,400
basically white labels

460
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,020
gots a different shell oku like maybe
the maybe the stuff I reported got fixed

461
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,540
upstream and all these vendors using the
stuff also have these fixes downstream

462
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:30,510
that's that's the hope that didn't
happen so like I found out in 2013 this

463
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:35,620
camera has no assets on the web services
there I think our three hardcoded UNIX

464
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,490
accounts by default just because of the
vendor of the firmware like this their

465
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,630
stock firmware hardcore differentials
the entire from upgrade processes

466
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,890
insecure it's very adorable that there's
an md5 sum because some people might

467
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,950
like there's an md5 sum you're gonna
check the integrity make sure no one

468
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,310
like me

469
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,870
maliciously added the firmware well
they're both coming over clear tax so I

470
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,490
can manipulate your md5 sum of the
player firmware and guess what they're

471
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,470
still match up correctly and then we
have time that enabled by default that

472
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,230
was a recent change they disabled
luckily so that's good news when I

473
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,480
bought the camera it wasn't that way
after a while they updated disabled that

474
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,840
so when this gets more interesting and
get a common theme will see on a lot of

475
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,730
OT devices today

476
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:24,960
default password of 120 route the model
number this camera's 124 username is

477
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,710
root 20 Reuters the password there is an
admin password now this is one thing

478
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,080
that changed versus the eyes on camera
did research on the iSight camera used

479
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,010
to have a hard-coded admin credentials
for the web app that would talk over and

480
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:46,409
actually do like API call security so
what they did in maybe what these guys

481
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:50,200
also kind of false Iran was they
actually decided that they would do

482
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,270
something really super secure and take
the MAC address of the device making me

483
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,990
five string of it

484
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:03,210
truncated to 10 characters and that is
now your security token because of

485
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,080
course MAC addresses are our private on
the network and no one can look at our

486
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,090
cash and figure out what your MAC
addresses so again what it's one of

487
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,540
those things like if you know cameras on
the network or you look up 20 you I to

488
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,690
manufacturing you're like oh that's one
of those cameras you can actually make

489
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,619
your own admin password for that camera
and have your own backdoor admin account

490
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,720
we're talking about and kind of a
foreshadow into what I was talking about

491
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,650
earlier where you should get rid of
services you don't get rid of binaries

492
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,470
you don't need they disable telnet yes
but what they did is they created this

493
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,349
thing called Camp underscore service
underscore enabled at CGI that all it

494
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:45,769
does is start tellin so you combine the
known password creation with unknown URL

495
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:50,019
to enable telnet with a hard-coded
backdoor root password and guess what we

496
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:55,029
have we have remote access or we have
remote shell until now so they disabled

497
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:58,880
son like insecure process they fixed an
insecure hardcore the password and

498
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,440
completely still shot themselves in the
foot

499
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,119
we're back to square one the one in the
bottom corners actually really

500
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,130
interesting in this gets back to the
supply chain problem all of this is also

501
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,559
pledging away but we've actually a
third-party cloud service that provides

502
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,230
cloud services for IP vendors they work
with a bunch of platform providers and a

503
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,609
lot of vendors and so they were
providing the interface to which they

504
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,589
were doing like live stream like that
was the functionality we've was like

505
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:29,109
supporting well we've when I was going
through I was looking around and just

506
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:33,720
like Dorking around some stuff and I
found like some cross site scripting and

507
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,970
I'm not a person that really gets super
excited cross-site scripting I find it's

508
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,910
super boring and generic not really
interesting however the one thing I

509
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,470
noticed a little bit after I actually
found the bugs I found was I was going

510
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,529
through the stuff so quickly when you're
researching 9 devices at one time

511
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:51,499
between work and life and everything
else that's a lot of stuff to look at

512
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:55,430
right and so I can just skip I was
hopeful that scripting all like noted

513
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,309
and come back to it later came back to
it later and didn't realize I actually

514
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:02,140
found stored cross-site scripting which
is slightly more interesting the

515
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,720
reflective because the same backend
interface to which the admins of the

516
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,650
Service are gonna use this database data
in there consoling administratively is

517
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,499
of course the same front and you know
use and stop just like different author

518
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:23,769
authorization levels and permissions so
I can change the DeviceID of this camera

519
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:26,130
make a name where you cross site
scripting

520
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,480
and they didn't use HTTP only which are
not surprisingly review on this kind of

521
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,140
stuff

522
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,390
HDB only basically prevents JavaScript
from actually looking at session data

523
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:40,039
effectively on a specific cookie that
you you you you said that Boolean port

524
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,589
so what that doesn't prevent from me
steal your session cookie putting into

525
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:50,119
my own browser and now I'm your session
on my browser while if I can do cross

526
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,849
site scripting that stored and it
affects a backend admin interface guess

527
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:54,630
who's

528
00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:01,069
session cookie I'm stealing I'm still
admin of the entire platform right so

529
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:04,470
this isn't just this camera that I own
it's not just this vendor using this

530
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:10,089
camera this is every single cloud
providing iraqi bender using we've I can

531
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:15,059
seal session and actually log in as
admin for the entire so very simple bug

532
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,980
I was like an afro and I'm talked about
today I just happen to take another look

533
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,170
and realize what I found just what it
was a complete platform take or four

534
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:29,200
nights he better wear this gets bad for
Philip specifically not leave is there's

535
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,940
a lot of different models of
conductivity right now with I T and this

536
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,740
is a very common one where you basically
have a reverse proxy so we have a camera

537
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,259
behind a home network

538
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:39,970
the home network talks you know to the
Internet the internet stocks the mobile

539
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,579
device

540
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:44,000
the question is how do you talk to the
camera behind your home network you can

541
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,029
do port forwarding not so common anymore
you can do you PNP getting less common

542
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:53,269
you can you reverse proxies like this so
what happens is there's a there's an

543
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:58,589
agent that talks on the camera out to a
cloud service on the Internet it

544
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:04,089
actually takes your web interface on
this cameras back end and puts it on a

545
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:08,539
public hostname and a public port on the
internet so this camera behind her home

546
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:11,750
network is no longer behind your home
network on the Internet publicly facing

547
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,589
where this falls apart is there's a lot
of ways to do this ok like you can do

548
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:19,150
not great ways but there are ways you
like I P weightless team who is the

549
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,599
source of this original transaction a
token where you authenticate every

550
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,720
transaction make sure there's about
token granted his all-clear texas hold

551
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,039
another set of problems here

552
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,799
but what happens is this proxy is the
entire back and web interface and

553
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:38,150
there's a bug in how they deploy this
where there is no authentication if you

554
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,469
can find this camera's port and host
name on the internet which is

555
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:46,630
innumerable course you can literally
talk to the entire back in camera

556
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,019
without credentials without
authentication without a token without

557
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:55,169
an IP address source anything if you
find the camera you're talking directly

558
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:59,789
to the back and web interface which if
you forgot already we have a known CGI

559
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:03,299
script we can hit Enter on or you know
your browser hit enter and we were able

560
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:08,169
to remotely over the Internet which my
friends at rapid seven or so kind to

561
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:13,059
test for me this is a problem because
there are finite number of hostnames

562
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:17,489
they use for these proxy addresses and
has a finite number of port numbers and

563
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:21,439
as you probably know scanning the
internet is very very fast so you can

564
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:24,969
literally just scan these ports over and
over and over for all these hostnames

565
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:28,259
wait until you get a two hundred
response and you have a live camera on

566
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:33,009
the internet that you can pull open VLC
immediately with in with your dad is not

567
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:38,209
authenticated and start live stream that
camera or enable telnet or have a remote

568
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:42,669
code execution and actually from our on
there take your pick of bad scenario but

569
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:45,429
we have a camera on the internet without
any authentication that's kind of the

570
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:51,959
yarn that you also do fun things so as
is as you probably saw police all with

571
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:54,829
Chris house I can truly Miller's

572
00:40:54,829 --> 00:41:00,769
research they had put their tracks your
photo on the display on that and I'm

573
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:05,150
personally of the thought in mind set
that instead of like calcutta exe for

574
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,579
like you know Windows application like
you know cock we should use charlie

575
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:14,269
Crist tracksuits as a visualization box
so you can take over the stream that

576
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:18,449
people are seen on their mobile device
and we saw these bad TV shows like Oh

577
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:22,229
would it be funny if you could like take
five seconds of video and lupus you can

578
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,919
break in like still suffering leave and
then it goes back to live video like

579
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:29,819
we've seen that plot a million times you
can totally do that in IOT this is a

580
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:35,219
real life thing I can put charlie Crist
on a video stream for ever if you want

581
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:38,189
there's a lot of cool things you can do
when you have control over a camera

582
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:38,650
right

583
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:44,350
and so we went from recorded videos full
access to all recorded videos to kind of

584
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:50,330
opportunistic binary execution and video
streaming and all kinds of weird stuff

585
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,470
the summer in fence very popular camera
very popular brand for babies I don't

586
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,960
have time for this right now
unfortunately but a mere over at octave

587
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,220
disarray awesome research on this as
well that we're not going to talk about

588
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,290
things that he found last year but new
stuff I found this year one of which is

589
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,320
very subtle detail right which is how
did you password security of the right

590
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,330
way how do you password reset then
create accounts for this is not the way

591
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:17,020
to do it I think you'll be able to find
out so by default when you create an

592
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:22,240
account or they treat account for you I
should say it uses your last name

593
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,800
truncated eight characters and their
groupId which is kind of a cell number

594
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,700
integer for your account so it's
happenstance say that someone in your

595
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,890
family but when these cameras or someone
you know about when his camera as well

596
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,950
you know their last name we have an
integer to start with you go before you

597
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,010
go after it and you're probably gonna
find their default password account

598
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,680
because let's face how many people are
gonna change default password let alone

599
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,290
one that looks secure like on that
unlike the surface like someone with you

600
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,300
that your your family my parents would
say that passed but that's a great

601
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,000
passwords got a capital letter it's long
it's got numbers I'm not gonna change

602
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,240
I'm gonna use it a big deal so you can
enumerate actually login credentials

603
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,260
because guess what people are going to
change them so this screenshot is the

604
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,900
most exciting screenshot you will ever
see

605
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,850
certainly today but it's kind of
important and the reason why it's

606
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:16,600
important in the in the text you can't
see down there is that on the first

607
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,740
screen there's this back and web
interface for this camera right you

608
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,660
login you can administrate things and
you can actually give privilege to

609
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,960
people you can actually say hey user an
email address whatever dot com I want to

610
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,840
give you permission to watch my baby
because you're my you know you're my

611
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,150
brother and my sister-in-law check out
your your niece or nephew you know

612
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:38,180
whatever from your own phone to give
them account access you let them see the

613
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,280
camera use it cool sounds good

614
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,800
the problem is and what you can't see
down there is there's a very simple

615
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,200
kroll command and the crook man has a
first name it's not a last name email

616
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,180
address and it's good it's got this
group IDC everything right

617
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:57,780
the thing it doesn't have as
authentication it doesn't require basic

618
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,590
authentication it doesn't require token
it doesn't require that doesn't require

619
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:06,310
password it requires no authentication
so guess what that means if you start at

620
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,460
a really low number and go to a really
high number and you run a for Lou you

621
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:15,940
can create counts on every single
person's camera out there and then just

622
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,990
open your mobile app login as them and
you're watching the video stream live of

623
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,600
that camera and you can even control the
camera too because that's the good

624
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,970
feature to have an attacker so again
very unsexy thing very boring but

625
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,910
because guess what I T security is not
good it's very bad all the bugs you've

626
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,820
seen today all the issues you see today
I guarantee 9% you're like oh that's not

627
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,960
even good bug I i agree with you there
terrible bugs but guess what I'm taking

628
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,230
over thousands of cameras at one time on
the internet thats good bugs are bad bug

629
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,910
that's a beautiful thing for an attacker
and when we see like one of stories

630
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,660
about like oh so-and-so broke into one
camera and like you know that in any

631
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,210
cool they broke into one camera we we've
literally taking data and camera access

632
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,700
over for tens of thousands of devices
from three different vendors with crappy

633
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,980
web boats so I would be platform
takeovers on top of that right so

634
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,830
disclosure stuff july fourth is kind of
a weird 8 because we had a fitted in for

635
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:18,710
a talk about is giving so we dropped the
July 4th USA USA disclosure date on

636
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,500
everyone we work with search for
everybody that we we we pass along and

637
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,000
we always do a sixty-day disclosure of
window for all the vendors that we talk

638
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,700
to you so we try to give people good
time to get back to us and work with us

639
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,230
and fix bugs and kind of all the good
feel good like full disclosure stuff but

640
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:38,800
not being in there we do with all these
vendors and so kind of a checklist and

641
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,980
this is kind of a quick wrap up just
kind of give a visualization of where

642
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,990
we're at

643
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:48,170
everybody we found we don't talk about
every issue that we saw but the

644
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,000
high-level view right if it hasn't
texted back

645
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,900
and there's a lot of exes up there right
so things like local API's or or cloud

646
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:01,060
API is using actual SSL TLS not having a
remote shell like Telnet and SSH not

647
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,920
having hidden accounts which you see
every single tap every single camera had

648
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,600
at least one hit an account that you as
a consumer doesn't know is there every

649
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,550
summer camp known vulnerabilities the 1
I'm talking about like boring

650
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,330
vulnerabilities were talking about like
gonna believe that actually do bad

651
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:22,300
things your taxes every school and had
you are still console and encryption

652
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,750
again one of one of the nine actually
had all the time in a flick this really

653
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:32,250
weird scoring rubric that tries to do
apples to apples badness and tries to

654
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,040
give you a sense of how good or bad news
cameras are so you take away points for

655
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,310
all these things all the camera store
with the same amount of points you take

656
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:43,840
away points for bad and that's where we
get left we get left with every camera

657
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,500
but one got an F if we take that point
scale and associate with like a great

658
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:52,870
scale increase to the one that got a
deal I get shot just he just got past

659
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:57,290
nephrite like it's almost an accident I
think on their part but overall I think

660
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:01,190
the takeaway if you couldn't tell from
the rest of this talk is terrible

661
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:05,590
consumer security for allergies terrible
it doesn't matter if you spent $55 or

662
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,670
tourist dollars it's terrible and again
these are baby monitors they're

663
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,660
completely made to invade your privacy
and they have terrible security and

664
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:19,100
whether or not you think it's a baby
monitor or smart TV or router we we see

665
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,950
these common things all the time there's
a lot of research yet to be done a lot a

666
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,180
lot of products every day coming to
market and no one's looking at so

667
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,090
overall i gather some bugs are some
things that would bother me I'm actually

668
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,450
expecting a kid and i can tell you I
won't be using any of these cameras even

669
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,800
though I have an entire drawer file free
devices I won't be using any of them so

670
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,570
that kinda gives you an indicator of how
I feel about overall security most of

671
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:49,230
these things that I didn't even take
time to care about like you know we care

672
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,890
about like you know see surf right okay
every single one of these cameras in

673
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:58,040
some way shape or form has a seizure I'm
not even go through and write up all the

674
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,270
CDs because I would go like Ray before

675
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:05,260
happened there are so many bugs that
it's not even worth getting into its

676
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,820
worth getting too critical bugs I think
but there are so many issues with these

677
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,960
these pieces of software for a variety
of reasons but just know that if you

678
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,130
want to get into the space you are going
to find books if you want to get into

679
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,350
offensive security research you will
find bugs IMG device so if you want like

680
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:26,150
that first like Robert I like I totally
have something go get an iTouch device

681
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:32,310
you will be an awesome hacker tomorrow
the overall everything is terrible

682
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:38,390
blind to everything is terrible 93 is
people are unaware of his terrible line

683
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:43,540
for is realistically like philip has
good skier program a lot of the stuff

684
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,670
again as supply-chain problems this is
gonna be a recurring thing you hear in

685
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,280
the news if you don't already about most
things our supply chain problem there

686
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,150
are some good initiative so who's over
there and I started built securely a

687
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:00,240
couple years ago to work with IP vendors
actually make me suck less we've done

688
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,650
pretty good in some some ways done a lot
of knowledge transfer have a lot of cool

689
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,040
partners and I T and making some making
some waves there which is good

690
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,190
a lot of your pie familiar with has more
than just the web top 10 if you wanna

691
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:16,420
wear a lot of other top 10 lists and
other research that they do and guidance

692
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,790
one of which is the top 10 the online
trust Alliance is currently in the

693
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,620
second round of drafting an IOT trust
framework which effectively gives you

694
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,050
full information security and privacy
controls that you should aspire to have

695
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:34,700
surgery under its kind of a good a good
like scoring rubric in its own right to

696
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,120
say oh I do provide retention of data
policies I do

697
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,490
data I do X Y and Z so it's it's at
least a starting point for vendors to

698
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,940
actually know what they should be doing
because as we've seen today there's not

699
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,560
really a good sense of what people
should be doing that would make it

700
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,400
secure and then Google has some projects
that have come out recently closed basin

701
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,320
hardened stripped-down Android version
that is made from which he devices and

702
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,380
they're starting using their own
products like that just came out awhile

703
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,240
ago maybe the next camp as well not sure

704
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,810
and there's also we've which is secure
communication between devices so one of

705
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,340
the biggest balls we have getting back
to supply chain is we have bad firmware

706
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,070
and a lot of bad firmware could be
resolved if we had a good provider of

707
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:20,980
firmware

708
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,130
trying to solve that problem for a lot
of people give good from where that has

709
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,850
basic hardening done and now we don't
have all these bugs I talked about fraud

710
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:35,660
cases and I don't know where to capture
the snicker Coco coming up but Nick got

711
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,700
this crazy shirt and take a picture for
this talk will basically like yeah I

712
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,680
mean whether it's stream you know
screaming babies or blowing up like pins

713
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,740
or whatever the crazy I'm sure you want
to talk about today is there's a lot of

714
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,840
research like I said go go buy stuff go
break stuff a lot of fun learn a lot of

715
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:59,270
techniques and do some cool stuff but I
would hope that you would say like oh

716
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:02,790
yeah protecting like family's privacy
and babies and stuff is cool like I was

717
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,480
pretty happy to do this research I think
there's a lot of benefit to you know to

718
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,040
consumers that don't know otherwise and
can't protect themselves so there's a

719
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,690
lot of property or there's a lot of
problems in the area that you can help

720
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,840
so you know go go try to make a
difference in that regard i think im a

721
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:33,619
couple mins overtime any like one or two
quick questions that I cancer

722
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:41,279
so the question basically is a look at
camera thats Akhtar their camera that

723
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:46,930
don't suck so I'm I'm of the mind set
honestly if you don't need some of the

724
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:50,339
interactive features of a baby monitor
you should just getting our appt monitor

725
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:55,900
are are are are FBI monitor still
susceptible to attacks absolutely right

726
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:00,900
however are you susceptible to attacks
across the entire internets know you're

727
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,509
susceptible to we're down the street
from you that has the knowledge that you

728
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:09,619
like software defined radio stuff so
that's a really mitigated attack surface

729
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:14,789
versus the entire internet right that's
my personal opinion I do have like I

730
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:18,319
i've a Dropcam that I have in my house
that I love I'm kind of worried about

731
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,999
some of the new things I've seen with
the next version of the Dropcam but

732
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:25,410
overall pretty pre-sold camera good
security team over there

733
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:31,009
overall the less features you need the
better by the camera with the least

734
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:34,690
features because the more features mean
more attacks service right it's the same

735
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:41,480
principle that we do with everything in
scurry any other quick question dave you

736
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:54,509
look i think thats my last question
thanks Dave so thank you very much for

737
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,059
coming hope you have a great time at
work on
