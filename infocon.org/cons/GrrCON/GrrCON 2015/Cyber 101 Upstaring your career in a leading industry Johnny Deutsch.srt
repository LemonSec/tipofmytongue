1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:12,080
hey guys thanks for coming out today
signed a standard eight going to

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,820
conferences so thanks for being here
before we actually start I want to make

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,179
sure to have the right people in the
room so this talk is not a technical

4
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,669
talk

5
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:27,909
it is not geared towards someone that
has been in cyber security for the past

6
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:34,640
you know few years five years not
someone from the industry this talk is

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,800
basically geared toward people that are
cheaper to practitioners that want to

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,220
get into cyber security students that
want to get into cyber security and

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,000
other people that has no background and
don't really know the industry that want

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,590
to get into this industry so if you're
not from these groups I will not be mad

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,400
you could leave the room otherwise you
might be frustrated because you already

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,850
know this stuff here we got one leaving
not know actually got one coming in you

13
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,399
can see the screen well as even a better
reason cool so what are we going to talk

14
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:22,210
about so first bit of intro me then
we're going to talk about the industry

15
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,039
itself to cyber security industry we're
gonna talk about the necessary

16
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,850
background in order to get into this
industry training you have to do and

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,340
things of that sort then we're going to
spend some time talking about actually

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,049
the industry what is consulting work
what is technology work and what is

19
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:47,389
consumer work or enterprise work as you
would most likely see it and then a few

20
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:53,650
pointers for job hunting and some key
points to conclude my thinking

21
00:01:53,650 --> 00:02:02,260
so who am I to have weird history you
might hear an accent here I can talk in

22
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,670
my Israeli accent just as much and you
will recognize me much better though but

23
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,320
you're used to an American accent so
let's do that so I am next captain of

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,590
the Israeli intelligence forces
specifically dealing with cyber warfare

25
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:21,510
the big thing in israel if you've heard
the book start-up nation if you know a

26
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,100
small company called checkpoint that's
us we've done plenty of stuff when it

27
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,650
comes to cyber security we can elect
that field so I used to be a deputy see

28
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,880
so for one of our agencies one of our
basically intelligence agencies the

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,440
largest for development the parallel to
DARPA here so I was device see so far it

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:55,590
is really dark I went and will
moratorium why as you might know why are

31
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,610
innocent young more known to be an
accounting firm but the firm does

32
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,769
consulting so they acquired us we were
in Israeli startup doing application

33
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:13,100
security testing a firm called tactics
hacking tactics for a bunch of like 14

34
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,840
guys we required into ey and we're a
part of the Global Services servicing me

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,709
was clients in all matters I T
security-related so consultants from

36
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,610
Israel I transferred to the you s where
I became the senior manager within the

37
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:38,780
EU I national practice I'm based out of
Houston so took a flight to get here and

38
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,100
I've been talking about cybersecurity
for the past few years around the world

39
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,120
I like to travel I've done a talk here
as well

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,709
think three years ago about social media
and intelligence collection why Facebook

41
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,440
is an intelligence officers dream and

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,180
one of one of few people sent out emails
and I saw within the content of the

43
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,500
emails that they want to get to know
more about the industry to have a basic

44
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,350
understanding in it it's beyond our
reasonable idea for a talk so this is

45
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:22,610
the talk so if we look at Cyber s
exciting word or idea security be less

46
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,530
exciting and meaning the same thing it
is a huge industry right now just to get

47
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,900
an understanding the market value of
cybersecurity in 2015 is five billion

48
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,880
dollars that is a lot of money just
think of it I mean you just can't really

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,380
take it to any other industry and say it
is so big and by 2020 hundred and

50
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,570
seventy billion dollars that's just
inconceivable you think of this in the

51
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,660
amounts most of the amounts will be
consumed on technology and not on

52
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,600
consulting as we will talk about but
then again that's still something that

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,530
you know people are spending a lot of
money

54
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,620
think of the fact that you will spend
even though that the billions of dollars

55
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,230
for just facility for cybersecurity for
cybercrime is just a hundred and one

56
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,960
billion dollars I mean is just if you
just break down cybercrime you don't you

57
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,160
don't take it down with cyber terror
with suburb so much that jurors and so

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,040
much money floating around

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,640
and it's costing billions of dollars to
business so it's a good starting point

60
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,330
to say europe if you want to get into
this job you'll probably have something

61
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:45,810
to do for the next at least 20 years so
when we look at this industry we try to

62
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,380
split it down like you don't know
anything about cyber you want to get

63
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:58,500
into it so the common elements our deeds
first consulting like myself firms that

64
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,810
are here to help you are here to fix an
idea to fix a process to fix a

65
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,450
technology to fix something

66
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:13,660
ok and who was a damn thing in the
keynote the guy said that consultants

67
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,850
are the guys are paid to read the manual
so yeah

68
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,930
times he's he's absolutely right and
just sometimes the company just doesn't

69
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,360
know what manual to go after so we have
to find out manual and go after that one

70
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,250
and try to implement and then fix it you
have to ecology remember I mentioned

71
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,970
checkpoint to shake the checkpoints of
the world the security appliances of the

72
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,850
world all the big vendors and a big
security technology companies they're a

73
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:48,050
very big part of this industry they're
21 looking out after 275 billion dollar

74
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,400
statement there like ok I want to go
after that market as I want to own that

75
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,500
specific segment that's the technology
but we're talking about at the end the

76
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,130
consumers people that actually go
through and work with these appliance

77
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,210
work with the consultants and tried to
defend organizations that they're

78
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:17,780
working with so a major part of the
industry so

79
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:25,840
common questions is how do I get in like
what sort of training do I need I mean I

80
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,040
went to school i studied I T I did
exactly major cyber security how does

81
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:41,450
that go so many questions so one of the
things that I do I do recruiting for you

82
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:49,680
want as well and when I look at this
first I look at experience that is the

83
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,710
single most bang and the single most
important thing that i would tell you to

84
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,300
emphasize they're probably saying women
and Johnny were all without the right

85
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,550
background so I can experience would we
have so going to conferences talking to

86
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,310
people

87
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,830
networking is a valid experience

88
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,910
if you take it on and you'd be able to
have a conversation topic with the

89
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,990
recruiter about something that really
bugs you about I T security things that

90
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,890
you believe that you could have done
better even if you really couldn't have

91
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,040
done it better but you have an idea
really just sometimes on the other end

92
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,020
of the phone interviewing someone there
is a dead silence that I want to be

93
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,120
filled and not by me cause I'm already
working forty why I want the other guy

94
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,300
to tell me so it's very important to
talk about what have you did and it

95
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,910
really could be small things like you
contributed to the community wrote a

96
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,390
script that fixes something and you
believe could be fixed and not

97
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,110
necessarily about fixing sometimes you
just exploiting that's completely legit

98
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,190
but there I would caution you to be very
careful a lot of us when somebody says

99
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,780
yeah well I broke this machine while I
walk walked into this network that's

100
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,120
that's a red alarm for us so do
everything with the right caution you

101
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,980
don't want to go when you know so the
key in the first keynote was going to

102
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,600
BestBuy and tried to hack everything no
you will not you could write technical

103
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,080
but you would probably not get a job
with Best Buy or with a lot of the other

104
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,440
consultancies because there's a man
there's a measure of responsibility to

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,730
the tester has we all know that things
are broken and the concept is we want to

106
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,600
make it better if we go poke how these
people nothing nothing will change we

107
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,150
want to be responsible so finding out
the issue is very relevant so yeah so we

108
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,760
have in your experience if you've found
something nobody hired you but he

109
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,840
founded that could be legitimate topic
to talk to someone like myself

110
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,340
one of the most important things is the
mindset everybody talks about this

111
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,080
attacker mindset and you know when even
back in the Army when we interview and

112
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,430
yeah we interviewer like only the
intelligence community is allowed to

113
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,530
interviews as you probably know an
israeli have a mandatory free your

114
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,720
service so everybody goes into the army
so how can you really interview with

115
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,510
everybody going in saudi intelligence
sources get a specific exemption under

116
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,150
like ok we're the only service that is
allowed to disqualify people from going

117
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:40,510
in serving so as a young officer you
have an option to try and track in and

118
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:46,830
find these right individuals so we're
out to finding that attacker mindset who

119
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:53,610
is this person that is 18 years old he
does not have any experience now I need

120
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,490
to be able to tell the world or more
likely my commander that I believe that

121
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,100
he can actually graduate from our course
and he would be a good attacker or

122
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,690
defender depending when it comes to
sweet spot these people so a lot of a

123
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:18,410
lot of spotting the mindset is people
just then just don't get why our stuff

124
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,040
the way they are you walk into a
conversation and something that is a

125
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,740
conversation stopper you know you go and
you talk to people about even to

126
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:35,790
stupidest stuff you wouldn't believe
like how on earth would a ship stopped

127
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:42,250
mid see what like how does it work has
nothing related I D security just

128
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:48,530
nothing is just a logical question how
are you able to stop the ship so we do

129
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:54,560
all sorts of these cycle technical
analysis and the whole concept is just a

130
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,080
fine those people that defy that
specifically don't get the right answer

131
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,010
but they tried to date riding you don't
really i mean you can't really stop

132
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,170
fully amid C

133
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,070
and it's it's completely legit but we
want to get that mindset that says okay

134
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,529
I don't know but let's find out so let's
logically breakdown this problem and

135
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:26,320
find it out so we're looking forward at
balance that is not stressed cuz you

136
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,649
know a lot of people on during
interviews should be asked something and

137
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:39,250
then you'd be the worst was like ok take
a minute ok good question let me think

138
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,139
on it for a second

139
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:46,410
don't be afraid of pauses at that point
that's a good time to pause and

140
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,959
sometimes saying I don't know is a valid
answer is we sometimes need these people

141
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,800
as well listen to Freakonomics you
should hear about an episode that talks

142
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,709
about I don't know amazing one so when
it comes to education

143
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,829
most of the veterans and this industry
don't really believe in formal education

144
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:17,510
the Shockers and it goes for years we've
been saying we don't really get quality

145
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,770
and university people that have studied
something that could be very much

146
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:28,040
applied onto cybersecurity for years
that has been so it hasn't been for the

147
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,670
past 34 years this has changed programs
have opened up and universities are

148
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,770
taking a stab at this and doing some
good work so there is one thing I can

149
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:48,250
tell you is that please do not assume
that I know what your program is ok talk

150
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,780
to me what sort of research has your
program did what was the tasks that your

151
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:59,450
professor gave you go and walk me
through it I don't know it I haven't

152
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,140
done any formal education you know when
it comes to cyber security and most of

153
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:12,960
us haven't heard anything the next thing
is certifications out of that 75 billion

154
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,300
industry billion dollar industry
certification large part of it

155
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,770
everybody is like ok you know when I'll
get my CH the making going start

156
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:28,410
interviewing I went into Wikipedia just
get like the rough estimate of how many

157
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,170
security training certifications are
there hence I was amazed I thought there

158
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,550
were like 20 years online that matters
it's more like seventy and we don't like

159
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,450
people that are from the injury would
not necessarily know all of them and

160
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:50,220
it's not necessarily good or bad they
have a certificate it really really

161
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,640
really depends on where he trying to get
into ok you wanna be a pen tester

162
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,740
training is very good but if you go
after the offensive security

163
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,670
certifications which are very hard
because they have a lot of technical

164
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,720
background they're very good as well so
you need to really fit and see that your

165
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,230
certifications are

166
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,710
towards where you actually want to go to
you could have a valid Cisco

167
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,850
Certification legacy CNN that could be
very valid because somebody knows that

168
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,160
you know the basics of thanks and it is
important because a lot of people don't

169
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,040
know the basics and things and they just
go in applications without knowing what

170
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,330
runs on the back end there's so as the
guy before me said background here is

171
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,780
very very important you're not born a
cyber security guy everybody has

172
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,430
something in their past either being a
developer being in general I T

173
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,510
practitioner experience really matters
here because sometimes people try to

174
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,810
invent the wheel and it's the worst
thing when you're talking about

175
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,900
cybersecurity so it's very important
that you do you choose the right one

176
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,790
not necessarily because it's the most
technical one but the one that really

177
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:13,930
fits with what you want to do you want
to have a idea risk background is okay a

178
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,680
lot of certifications there but if you
wanna technical one don't get a ninety

179
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,620
risk one don't get a ninety risk one and
go interview to be a pen tester it would

180
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:31,250
not help you will not help the cause so
a song about the industry first

181
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,400
consulting so I think it's the best job
ever been doing it for like five or six

182
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:44,550
years so I might be the right person to
ask if if it is or it isn't

183
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:50,350
when I look at consulting and
cybersecurity I break it down to three

184
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:56,550
types of of consultants the first you
have done management consulting is the

185
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:03,260
broadest types of consulting and we will
go one-by-one you'll have the technical

186
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,880
guys those pen tester told the amount
and we have the technology people the

187
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,949
people that help you move along your
organization into the right direction

188
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:19,600
after the management consulting guys
said you should go there so the

189
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,280
management consulting so management is
only as you probably own though is a

190
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,950
very broad term to everything that you
can manage how to improve processes and

191
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,150
my business so cyber is no different

192
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,320
is a big issue we need now to know what
we need to have an organization how do

193
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,140
we prioritize it and how do we put it on
a road map with proper initiatives and

194
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,340
manage it for the next five years so
what management consulting and cyber is

195
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:56,570
is a way to establish a program for
cybersecurity in an organization as you

196
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,450
understand i mean cyber security is not
just one appliance that you buy

197
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:07,030
companies that really take this matter
seriously have big departments you know

198
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,900
people staff with like 50 people that
need to know what are their where they

199
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,730
messing around with its not people that
you know go up putting fires its people

200
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:23,669
that have ad hoc functions and have
specific capabilities and specific job

201
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,270
descriptions so concerned management
consulting is all about building out

202
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,929
what are they going to do should we have
network monitoring on premise and we

203
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:38,280
need to build out a network monitoring
program should we have an Incident

204
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,190
Response Program how does that work
order eight people how to recruit

205
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,580
recruit them how do you find them who
needs to manage them all the processes

206
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,650
that could relate to it so these
consultants will go and look after

207
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:58,919
people technology and processes to see
if they do or they don't they don't they

208
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,090
recommend initiatives and the
organization manages these initiatives

209
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:08,419
so they move along with it they do
assessments on how mature as the

210
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:14,090
organisation compared to other
organisation within its specific at

211
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:20,679
specific industry and sector so these
are these management consulting people

212
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:27,080
management consultant have sometimes
people don't come from technical

213
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,080
background they know management they
know basic concept of these are the

214
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,720
things that you do need it within an
organization these are things that you

215
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,470
don't and let's try and work it out a
lot of times you will have a lot of

216
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,910
junior positions within management
consulting for cybersecurity because

217
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,919
there is a great demand for programs
like this and it's something that is

218
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:55,410
easily trained so you can pass on
without having a lot of background cuz

219
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,450
it's mostly structure you have people
with a lot of background but you'll have

220
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:06,820
a lot of staff people that don't
necessarily have the right back moving

221
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,779
on

222
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:12,719
are the guys and everybody likes to talk
about I come from this this is what I do

223
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:18,409
which is the technical dies the
technical consulting guys granted this

224
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:24,080
is the sexiest part of the industry I
think these are guys that due to

225
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,099
technical assessments in our guys to do
so social networking social social

226
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:33,769
engineering we break into an
organization with the right approval

227
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,759
walking through the door

228
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,589
officially and trying to hack into the
organization so you would find positions

229
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:47,649
for penetration testers that do just
about everything for penetration testers

230
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,690
as I said depending on the route that
you take I've replication or

231
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,999
infrastructure because depending on on
companies there's there's a difference

232
00:20:55,999 --> 00:21:00,739
we know that there are so many
technologies out there one person cannot

233
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:05,279
just rule them all so you'd have people
that specifically to application

234
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,249
security X developers that's great to
come from a background like this because

235
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:15,710
a lot of the things as the previous talk
was about fixing a Nexus S is a complex

236
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,109
issue sometimes so you need someone
which is actually an ex coder to talk to

237
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:23,269
the developers and say this is the
things that you need to do and this is

238
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:29,599
how you should do it so can testers are
mostly very technical therefore need to

239
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,679
have some sort of background and on the
infrastructure side you have people

240
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,309
directs network engineers mostly that
have that relevant background Mindy know

241
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,389
and that's the most important thing if
you don't have the right background you

242
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:49,539
just run commands you don't know why is
the input the way it is when you come

243
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:54,099
from for example a network background
you know why would that network engineer

244
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:59,519
do that and you know automatically where
to go look for in ok this is a financial

245
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:05,899
company I know that they have a lot of
branches they work with probably OSPF

246
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:12,570
for MPLS so therefore I'll go in and
attack these types of things

247
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,289
intuition it's not like you don't have a
methodology everybody has a methodology

248
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:19,610
but if you come from the right
background just spice up that

249
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,880
methodology and you find everything the
real real interesting stuff with a lot

250
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,149
more ease so very versatile backgrounds
here when I say network it doesn't have

251
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,130
to be at work you can come from a guided
does backups but really knows the

252
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:42,309
organization so much into into specific
Lee so I've tried personally believe

253
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:47,320
that this is the most interesting part
in terms of consulting no subjective

254
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:56,169
probably never part are the incident
responders the incident responders are

255
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:00,250
part of the technical consultants as
well these are the guys that will come

256
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:06,399
in after the breach and will start to
investigate the business to business

257
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:12,909
casual business but the actual breach
you'd be surprised people also all sorts

258
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:17,500
of roles as a background they think that
you know shouldn't organizations have

259
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,409
this capability and sign it when you
come to an organization that has been

260
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:27,970
breached there is chaos even if they
have good processes in place it's it's

261
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,950
like if you're a doctor ok and you're in
a car accident of course you know

262
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,460
everything to do but you know the actual
chaos that went around you just confuses

263
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,360
you you can't really do anything that's
a very good explanation to why

264
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,139
organizations will take incident
responders because he hasn't responded

265
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:50,070
and I have done many of those as well
you can come into an organization which

266
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:56,360
is completely you know this may you have
the c-level executives and a room that

267
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,480
they've never seen in their lives

268
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,919
and they're talking around and they're
pushing people and one of the first

269
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,380
things as a consultant that you come
that people from the country just can't

270
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,210
do is you ask all the c-level executives
to leave the room

271
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,540
guys are stressing out your people
nothing good will happen from this year

272
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,610
to calm guy so if you have good you know
if good capability your eased to do

273
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:27,040
certain things I like people to come to
instant response that have their older

274
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,610
people because they have the wiser you
know they've seen stuff happen

275
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,860
they've seen stuff brake and that's not
the end of the world so you know it's

276
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,750
very important here a lot of the train
there are certifications on incident

277
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,270
response you know a lot of stands
training there and a lot of vendors

278
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,890
specific training and in cases that the
software that you actually do to work

279
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:58,190
with pending on you know whatever
preventer you work with solder is good

280
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,090
good training capabilities here and
there are a lot of positions for

281
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:10,880
incident responders either within
organizations or as specific consultants

282
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,740
please remember this you have to be
someone which is calm they would not

283
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,919
tell you that in the interview and if
you cannot work in a stressful very

284
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:29,440
stressful environment this is NOT the
work for you so please keep that in mind

285
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,830
moving on other types of consultants are
technology consultants are two guys who

286
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,100
would oppose ok when you talk about the
technical so what's the difference would

287
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,470
acknowledge canceled so no technology
consultants are very focused their

288
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,620
focused on a problem so as you remember
to management consulting guys said okay

289
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,730
guys you need to improve your software
development lifecycle program to match

290
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,889
the relevant advancement within
cybersecurity go okay what does that

291
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:07,470
mean so you need to start an initiative
what does that mean by means that you

292
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,789
need to recruit the right people we need
to add specific software into your

293
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:17,179
platform you need to change the
development cycle you need to integrate

294
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:23,009
controls into your development you need
to train your your programmers to code

295
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:27,350
better you need to create a ninja
positions somebody there will be a

296
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,289
software security architect within
various departments would come to you

297
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:37,210
know say but how do we do it you go I
have just a guy for you so these are the

298
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,919
ecology guys have a good knowledge
consultants are here to solve a very

299
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,639
well-defined problem they have
experience with one specific field

300
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:53,340
they're not depend testers that will
just walk across every specific every

301
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,159
specific field Centre Street will it
need to know just a bit from everything

302
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,649
but you don't have to be an expert on
something specific you could but doesn't

303
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:07,710
specifically help you so a good example
of software security as we have a lot of

304
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,909
stuff how to actually add the value and
add the right people and organisations

305
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:17,120
we had people that come from specific
backgrounds and they go in managed a

306
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:24,340
specific operations will be consultants
that would have long term long term stay

307
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,310
within a specific client

308
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,890
they would spend a lot of time they're
built a good relationship now work with

309
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,220
engagement there are six months

310
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,350
pen tester will come into renovation a
week to free for is like doesn't happen

311
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:44,190
and then he moves on these kind of
consultants know everything about the

312
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,380
people they're working for its like he's
an employee of the company but then he

313
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,110
leaves after six months you would find
these positions and I M which is

314
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,750
identity management identity access
management people don't want to every

315
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,300
basically every technology that has a
process behind it

316
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,800
ok then you can just so iam is is the
whole way that you manage identities

317
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,160
within the organization so companies
like Oracle will come to you says I have

318
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,230
no idea I'm just install it can't be
easy have to sync it with all the

319
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,540
relevant data bases to the organization
has all the relevant access systems need

320
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:25,160
to define the processes it is such a
complex issue doesn't mean you don't

321
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,570
have to do it you just need to have
consultants to do it for you because

322
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,570
just wouldn't be able to do it on your
own so I am security monitoring that

323
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,200
doesn't do security operations centers
guys to manage your vulnerabilities in

324
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,080
gaza duty or software security it's
basically every one that says okay we

325
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:51,420
have a technology we need to understand
the process behind it if I want to go

326
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:57,120
and say pros and cons then the first
thing that you know I mean I like it of

327
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:04,040
course and a lot of the consultants get
to see new environments every two to six

328
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,740
weeks

329
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,450
ok depending on the type of consultants
so you need to understand that that's

330
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,610
one of the major challenges times when
used in place of these consultants like

331
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,840
to see more cuz that's that's how you
get better actually if you see more

332
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,280
infrastructure more types of
applications more technology news

333
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,780
conferences are not enough and training
or not enough so the beauty of

334
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,740
Consulting is that you just see you know
you don't go to conferences and you hear

335
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,760
about the latest stuff you probably had
a client that had this technology

336
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,500
installed

337
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,810
every talk within this conference I have
a client that has something related to

338
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:44,170
it so it's never news that's the beauty
of consulting was your dare you're

339
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,460
always on top of these tough he'll
probably never lose a discussion topic

340
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,250
while we're in the business but if you
like your house this is not the job for

341
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:00,860
you you get the travel at least 80% of
the time at least really I mean that's

342
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:06,510
that's the beauty of the U S at the end
you don't know where your clients will

343
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:13,180
be so you'd be on a plane just about
every Friday are every Saturday or

344
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:18,000
Sunday depending on the requirement of
the client if you if you're an incident

345
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,250
responder should be on a plane every
potential our you could be on call so

346
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,410
you know it really depends if you have a
flexible lifestyle though unable that

347
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:33,820
that's ok very good some positions like
technology consultants are you know more

348
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:40,230
morals they travel less are more stable
so you can find but then again you could

349
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:46,400
you could have a client that is you work
for six months but he's four states away

350
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,630
from you so it's the same environment
but it's still a lot of travel and it's

351
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:59,150
a stressful environment most of the time
again unless you're a technology

352
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,370
consultant most consultants are you know
when's the deadline when do we get to

353
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,820
get the report can we get a draft report
because we before we get the actual

354
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,190
report we want to review it but I'm
working on the report and I'm on last

355
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,980
week of reporting now we want to get
address you want me to start reporting

356
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,200
before I'm supposed to locate her so
much stress you end up working in

357
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,050
weekends lot of times to just get the
demands and again that's where the calm

358
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,680
people that have experienced than oh
yeah I've seen clients and asked us for

359
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,210
this before

360
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,440
ok I will not work the weekend fordice I
will wait so if you're not kind of

361
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:45,740
person who is good for you and people's
person had so you do not know how

362
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:51,270
consultants are always working with
people or not the people if you don't

363
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,270
like people you don't you're not good at
relationships he can't start up you know

364
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:09,260
small talks now exactly the business for
you so moving on technology when IC

365
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,409
technology I mean security vendors and
service providers large service

366
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:18,809
providers so what do they have you want
to go job hunting at these people so

367
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:26,200
first they have consultants as well but
they have very oriented go into the

368
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,789
pacific consultants so if I me product
company I want to be able to send you a

369
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:35,580
consultant they will tell you that you
basically need my my product in an

370
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,470
unbiased way ok somewhat but I would
still need to have some sort of rhyme

371
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,590
and reason to the fact that you need the
product some companies have actual

372
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,380
consulting practices small just to
support the overall business that they

373
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:58,230
have so you would see this existence of
consultants within specific security

374
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:05,200
vendors it's not uncommon but you know
just be able to understand that's not a

375
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,450
real consultants that works for a
consulting company so all the benefits

376
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:16,690
of the supporting environment that a
consultancy can provide you will not be

377
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,620
there so you know prioritize it if you
want to be a consultants that's probably

378
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,430
not the best place

379
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,990
then you have the RND guys the guys of
Duty actual research when you hear about

380
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,770
you know the latest and greatest and you
see large reports from i to security

381
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,600
companies nonspecific consulting
companies this is dis will always be the

382
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
Department will do it

383
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,240
the guys that basically do research with
the intention to develop their product

384
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,150
think of it of people that try to
develop new signatures have an idea for

385
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:55,540
IBS so I'll be in the R&D department and
I'll be searching for new stuff but I

386
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,490
will write my report about this latest
and greatest attack but I would only

387
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:06,350
also make a signature for that specific
that specific attacks oh my my security

388
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:12,100
vendor could actually spotted so if you
want security research positions

389
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,790
security vendors are the place to go to
their their highly secret out for him

390
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:25,840
it's when a lucrative position and if
you're not a people person that's her a

391
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,630
place to be in sometimes and everything
that you see as developers so I have a

392
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,840
friend that wanted to go into business
and one of the first thing that he he

393
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,360
said you know I'm a developer I want to
work as a developer and a security

394
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,570
vendor and that's a mistake you don't
get to advance if you work as a

395
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,690
developer you just need to know that if
you're a developer he want to convert

396
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,170
into I T security do not gonna be a
developer in a nightie security company

397
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:59,280
will not learn security for debt ok you
create and you'll develop would have

398
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,740
done the exact same thing that you would
have done and your previous form so my

399
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,820
personal advice not a lot just don't go
if you want to be a developer that's ok

400
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,900
there's nothing wrong with developing
but just keep in mind

401
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,320
unnerving that you would very commonly
have a pre-sale guys to pre-sell guys

402
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,910
don't tend to be very technical people
who like what

403
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:27,340
salespeople article just presale Geils
are the guys dad

404
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:33,000
the client is not sure that he is about
to buy this product of ours free soda is

405
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,730
basically an engineer and is sent over
to the client side and sets up the

406
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,460
system to work just for a short time
period so the client will see the value

407
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:50,790
of the system so we have people that are
sent very short time period and they

408
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:55,630
need to know the product the best way to
they can so the client will see the

409
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:01,900
value of the of the specific product for
presale it might not sound sexy but it's

410
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,180
actually a very interesting line of work
because they yet to have good client

411
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:15,190
interaction day really really contribute
to the company actually contribute to

412
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:21,300
having a sale and showing how good that
you're working for can improve certain

413
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,330
clients and they get to be very
technical so it's a very very good

414
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:35,580
business to be in most guys 900 highly
technical they love what they do and you

415
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:40,530
have engineers engineers are basically
the support people that run the product

416
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,300
on the daily basis so if you see a
security engineer within a product

417
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,620
company would most likely be a security
engineer that supports the overall

418
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,600
activity of that specific product
residing in client-side just to keep

419
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
that in mind

420
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,630
lastly you have account people come
people are not mostly are not technical

421
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,880
people there

422
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,180
people's people their sales ok I want to
create I want you to buy more products I

423
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,690
want you know gives you a discount
whatever it is they want to keep that

424
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,860
Klein on so they're looking into getting
to the business it's not a technical way

425
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,480
to get into that business but sometimes
you just have your old early have the

426
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,370
more you know the experience approach
into this could be a very good job for

427
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:33,460
you as well and it is within
cybersecurity

428
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:40,410
it's a very stable work have a lot of
friends that work in security vendors

429
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:46,570
highly technical people and we don't get
to travel goods if you like your house

430
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:54,540
and you wanna stay in it so you have
plenty of stuff good compensation and if

431
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:01,420
you've got in before an IPO before the
company was actually you could have very

432
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,710
good very good compensation sometime
soon after it depends on the type of the

433
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,589
company please keep in mind and that's
something that I've seen with a lot of

434
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:17,230
people to do are indeed when you do are
indeed you only do are indeed so I have

435
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:23,180
had friends that did that one of the
reasons that they left pen testing was

436
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,650
you know we just didn't get enough of
each time we want to do more research we

437
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,000
want to get to know more stuff because
when you do pen testing you don't really

438
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,010
do research you do a specific type of
research help your project but you see

439
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,730
sometimes you see you spot that there is
a way in but you need a week to week to

440
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:50,820
develop it but there's no budget to do
it so and and a lot of industries get

441
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,670
frustrated and they say well I want to
move on

442
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:58,810
onto R&D work because I want to do I
want to death full time I fall in love

443
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:05,830
with this most of the guys that have
done this transit that transition would

444
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:12,869
leave the R&D company within two years
because it's the same thing you're doing

445
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:18,290
the same thing you're more likely
supporting a specific product therefore

446
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:24,650
finding out specific vulnerabilities
that are focused on that specific vector

447
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:29,630
you're doing you know web you will only
do web he will not touch anything which

448
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,700
is infrastructure where as a consultant
a pen tester

449
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,460
does everything so he gets exposed to
everything so keep in mind you know

450
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,080
sometimes I have friends that have
stayed in R&D for five years already so

451
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,120
I mean it could be a stable business and
it could be somebody move on on top

452
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,490
management or whatever you want its low
pressure people that do are indeed you

453
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,640
or whatever it's mostly low pressure you
don't really get pressured into it

454
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,730
75 billion dollar industry would buy the
product almost without it needing to

455
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:15,680
actually work ok it sounds funny but
every product ok you would buy it and

456
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,460
you would not exactly test that it's
actually doing the work sometimes you

457
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,550
just need to fill in a specific product
saying OK we have an ideas and place

458
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:30,600
fortunately it doesn't have to be an
actual good I so keep their minds of

459
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:38,779
there's plenty of money in that industry
now let's move on to consumers so how

460
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,780
would if you're actually looking for
work and you don't want to work for a

461
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,340
company that does I security over
consulting or technology you could just

462
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:52,160
go work at what we call clients but you
know organizations that have their own

463
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,100
cybersecurity departments so how would
that kind of department look like and

464
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,910
what would be D people working there so
when you go on LinkedIn and you're like

465
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,960
I see this position what does that
actually mean the first most

466
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,150
organizations will look something like
this

467
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:14,920
ok don't you know i mean you have
variations of this but first thing is

468
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,960
the chief information security officer
you have some foreign governments

469
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,200
Department a friend for mobility
management department added protection a

470
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,870
sock in a consulting small consulting
operation depending on the size to

471
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,510
business it will always look very
similar to this some will be different

472
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,480
different names like someone say no

473
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,600
and that's exactly you'd say to see so
it'd be head of security not exactly

474
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,750
sober so many variants but they were
basically do just about the same thing

475
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,340
so the first guy to see so he's done for
most guy for everything I D security

476
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,960
within the organization

477
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,200
ok d like to say that he's the trusted
advisor to CEO wants to talk about I T

478
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,520
security asks the sea so you will call
to see so far chat

479
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,640
these are mostly executive level rules
you're not from the business you're

480
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,530
probably not going to be the first is
probably not gonna be the first job that

481
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,640
you get their accountable for everything
so basically when you look at Cyber

482
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,270
Security the CEO delegates' know the CEO
needs to handle cyber security as well

483
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:26,350
but he delegates and creates this person
you know chief says officer of

484
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:31,280
information security officers IC so this
is OK you'd be my guy responsible and

485
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,170
accountable

486
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:38,869
that's why a lot of times when big
breaches happen the sea so leaves you

487
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:44,250
know it's a common practice to just mean
he's accountable for it if you didn't do

488
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,839
the right things if he's really
accountable for it you would most likely

489
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,319
be replaced

490
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:55,420
you'd see in a lot of the major breaches
you'd be surprised that these people are

491
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,440
not technical did you get into an
interview and and and along the way the

492
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,329
see-saw interviews you don't be
surprised that it's more a one-on-one

493
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:08,670
interview that he just wants to get to
know you want to see if you're someone

494
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:13,170
that can work with him a lot of times
because these are executives they want

495
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,000
to make sure that if you're working with
another department you know let's say

496
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,359
your there their guy for software
security for working with that the

497
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:26,980
developers within the company or person
that they can work with you and your

498
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,670
people person you're somewhat people's
person least for developers so don't be

499
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,079
afraid of you know interviewing with the
big boss he would not always be

500
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,829
technically doesn't always care about
technical because he would believe that

501
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:44,579
you know certain things could be built
along the way the first apartment I'll

502
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,020
talk about his governance people often
hear about governance has the boring

503
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:54,990
stuff but not necessarily so the
government's apartment is mostly run by

504
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,900
someone that is as I love manager of
cyber security governance program

505
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:05,609
surprising and it the first thing it
does is that it creates all done all the

506
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:10,000
policies and procedures for
organizations so depending on the

507
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,760
industry that you're in you have to have
some sort of securities our security

508
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,099
policy and governance program in place
you have to say ok this is what we're

509
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:25,750
telling our people to do what not to do
this is our servers RIT guys are

510
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,109
functioning and these are the policies
that we have and you have to have

511
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:31,569
someone that is basically in charge of
it

512
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:36,690
as you might honored guests not
necessarily a technical person running

513
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:42,920
it or technical individuals the pin
depending on the specifics of of the

514
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,719
organization sometimes these people get
the work of disaster recovery and

515
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:53,400
business continuity management and so
you might see people you might see

516
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,109
positions there for Dr to Dr disaster
recovery is somewhat related to

517
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:05,549
cybersecurity and it is somewhat a good
way to get into cyber security but it's

518
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:11,119
not necessarily cybersecurity so you
might see you might see openings for

519
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,119
their they also managed a risk
management program within the

520
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:19,569
organization which that is more
interesting part of their work there are

521
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:25,440
two guys that say basically ok we had a
breach ok because a pen test found it

522
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,680
now what sort of risks does it pose on
our organization and how do we fix it so

523
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,359
they have an overarching view on what
goes on within the organization so

524
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:43,259
someone with experience very related
they also handle all the compliance the

525
00:45:43,259 --> 00:45:49,130
first dog before an added dimension PCI
so they'll be the ones that will work

526
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:54,009
with the consultants say OK are we
compliant or are we are we not

527
00:45:54,009 --> 00:46:01,289
and regulations of things of that sort
and other department will be the friend

528
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:09,410
zone ability management department so
these are the technical guys if a pen

529
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:17,469
tester once to retire he went off then
go into one of these departments he

530
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:22,299
doesn't want to travel anymore he wants
to do his stuff but on one client and

531
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:27,430
you'd be surprised because sometimes you
just want to spend your time on one

532
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,400
client sometimes you're like I keep
seeing this problem happening over and

533
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,150
over give me one environment that I can
make sure that I can fix it so you'd see

534
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,529
a lot of highly technical people they're
basically handling all the penetration

535
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:42,440
testing work

536
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,329
or fret modeling modeling is the concept
of not doing actual penetration testing

537
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:50,800
but finding the friends that could
relates to an application or an

538
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,910
infrastructure they would actually audit
everything that has been done in terms

539
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:05,180
of mitigation so if if the finding has
specifically stated that you have to do

540
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:11,810
this you have to create dispatch if you
have to yes to improve this development

541
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,730
things of that sort

542
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:16,390
there are two guys those ok you did this
but it didn't resolve it because I

543
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:21,950
retested it and that's the problem they
will also manage these offers securities

544
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:25,950
o'dell work with the developers to make
sure that coating the weight that they

545
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,829
should make sure that there's training
adequate training within the

546
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,390
organization

547
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:39,329
very technical people and think it's
kind of challenging work another part

548
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:43,880
will be the data protection so you'd
you'd hear head of data protection made

549
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,170
a prediction is a subset of
cybersecurity that is specifically how

550
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:54,579
we handle data so you've probably heard
of products to do the ALP work which is

551
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:58,670
that a leak or data loss management
products these are the guys that would

552
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:03,990
say okay this is the way we classified
data within our organization by this you

553
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:08,069
know by this system of classification
sensitive nuns and other public whatever

554
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:12,680
they decide this is the technology that
will support this specific day the

555
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,849
specific classification methods and they
will added it to make sure that works

556
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:25,300
adequately they're the ones that will go
and seek out each and every department

557
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,450
within the organization and work with
them you know I'll go and help out going

558
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:33,060
to work with the help this to make sure
that were working on our encryption the

559
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:37,420
way that we should because we have to
have full disk encryption saudis will be

560
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,270
DS

561
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,830
will work with each and every person
within the organization to make sure

562
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:50,580
that they're on track so plenty of roles
there sometimes managerial sometimes

563
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,190
technical depending on the size of the
organization

564
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,640
a lot of people that come from
consultants as technology consultants

565
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,500
because one of the practices of
Technology Consultants is deal P systems

566
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,100
GOP is very similar it is also a
technology that requires a process

567
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:14,650
behind it it's a good place to
transition into either to or from

568
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,040
depending on where you come from

569
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,680
so another one then you have the sock
the security operation center most of

570
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,370
the positions that you would see out
there are four stock analysts so these

571
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,390
are the guys that basically monitor
everything that goes on within an

572
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:39,280
organization on every part of your
infrastructure ok we all know that we

573
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,440
cannot the perception within 90 security
in recent years have changed from

574
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,600
perimeter security to monitoring ok with
the date the old conception was we will

575
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,860
defend our perimeter as hard as possible
and we will not get the attackers into

576
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,950
the organization we understood that this
is a fallacy and will not work they will

577
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,130
get into the organisation therefore we
need to monitor them so is is closely

578
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:09,920
monitored as we are we have we have a
way to actually find them so the stock

579
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,310
would actually be the staff that
monitors each and every part of the

580
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:22,420
network and the analysts will be 21
analyzing each and every request

581
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,089
vicious activity so they would have all
the times similarities to incident

582
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:32,660
responders but at a triage level they
just start they know that they have a

583
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,720
procedure to have to follow so they
start it but it's a good place to go

584
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,660
into the business because you need to
have some background but that background

585
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:49,130
can be covered with certifications or
with formal education and it is it's

586
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:58,040
it's very welcoming to start as an
analyst with a sock department in some

587
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,319
in some businesses

588
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:08,359
you also have consulting so health care
and financial organizations have come to

589
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:13,740
the conclusion that there are spending a
lot of money on consulting work and they

590
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:19,420
could be easily do it on their own for
highly critical systems so you would

591
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,730
have very good security practices for
consulting with in large organizations

592
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:30,589
and of course they have all the benefits
of not traveling and not having as much

593
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:37,390
stress as the standard consulting box
they'll be highly technical or highly

594
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:42,589
technology oriented and highly
mission-critical that they really helped

595
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:48,430
organization it's kind of rare nowadays
I mean it's a drawing thing but it's not

596
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:56,240
something that is so common as I said
throughout this label work it's

597
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,180
everything is reasonable

598
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,920
it's a good thing to start with a good
way to get in

599
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,849
and its European on the same environment
which as a consultant I can tell you

600
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:10,420
something which is exciting because he
really get to improve something you

601
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:17,470
really have your you know you have your
finger that to help fix and meant to

602
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:23,780
close this out we know that not
everybody meets the requirements now we

603
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:30,369
have right when we recruit it is
completely let you know trying get a job

604
00:52:30,369 --> 00:52:35,059
that you don't know 400% that you do fit
what you believe that you have the

605
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:41,150
capabilities to learn for it to develop
on to it as recruiters understand that

606
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:45,089
ok when we're on a call with someone we
know that no he doesn't tick all the

607
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:54,230
boxes but he has great potential please
won't learn how to write a cev it is so

608
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:58,750
important please remember that because
I'm too technical guy and I'll be a

609
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:04,390
manager getting this this would have
gone through for recruiters until I will

610
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:09,790
get the cev it's no different with any
other company just find the right way to

611
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:16,930
rate your cev on a one-page nobody looks
after the second page and you must be

612
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:22,460
drop you know CBS that have two pages or
just don't go after half of the first

613
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:28,369
page so please write paragraphs of how
lovely you are

614
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:34,740
be very precise and focus every cev has
to be focused to the position you're

615
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:40,430
applying to don't have a standard one
you have to fit it to fit the right

616
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:46,970
position ok it so you need to fit in a
bit but not so it's not something that

617
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,500
is too hard to do

618
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,910
you have to love this business I don't i
cant even extend how much you have to

619
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,150
love this person to be good at it

620
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:02,100
your friends have to be ICT security
guys his you want to talk to them about

621
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,430
it that's one of the first things are
you reading in the morning as I to

622
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:10,250
security news you have to go to
conferences you have to network with the

623
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,580
right people you have to spend enough
time

624
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:20,780
ok it's so many jobs are just not like
that I come from a line of Baker's ok we

625
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:27,180
have been making sense you know
seventeenth-century I think and you can

626
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:33,170
go home and shut everything off he'll be
a great Baker afterwards that's not the

627
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:38,920
way it works with cybersecurity ok you
have to give your soul into it

628
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:45,150
not everybody wants that work life
balance 2011 to be able to shut it down

629
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:50,570
and cut it off so we go to their
practice I don't believe that I security

630
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:55,440
is the right person the right place for
that person but you know I'm not the

631
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,050
expert I just have some some some sort
of experience of a decade's worth of

632
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:14,490
experience in this industry so that's
our guys think almost exactly on time

633
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:19,350
any questions as good as
