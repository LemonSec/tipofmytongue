1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:18,890
alright good morning how's everyone
doing this morning what's my name is Tom

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,359
don't want the company called sky-high
networks and basically the premise of

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,220
what I'm going to be talking about the
day is what happens when we no longer

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,039
have a network everything happens in
somebody else's data center and what do

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,789
we do about rights that's kind of cloud
access broker and that's one of the week

6
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:40,859
before I start to a little history just
to give you my background I run the

7
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,210
Midwest sky-high but I started back in
the early nineties one of my first

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,730
companies are on a consulting practice
and when we first start with computers

9
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,489
they were giant I actually worked on the
movie Independence Day it has remember

10
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,589
to have eighty pues as much as my laptop
that was a room of his Giants looking

11
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:04,970
graphics machines and so I live in this
whole process that we're going through

12
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,799
today which is back in the day the first
thing that we had to figure out why was

13
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,740
I have a machine and I have to control
what people do it right next we kind of

14
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,490
figured out maybe we should put stuff
causes viruses malware and so we started

15
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,610
focusing on the desktop and then this
thing the internet came out and now

16
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,920
things are leaving rights are not work
had ruled ball and ultimately what

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,140
happened is kind of like where we are
today as we ended up with devices that

18
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,990
are on our network that try to figure
out how to categorize how to figure out

19
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,439
what's a bad websites go to its a good
one and that's kind of what we're at

20
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,149
today the next-generation firewalls the
web to dot all that that's what we're

21
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,789
experiencing and this kind of cloud
right you know what happens this control

22
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:53,219
point what's happening is we're starting
to see an emerging technology which is

23
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,840
what we do when this information is now
happening outside of my network what I'd

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,009
do I protect it how to understand it how
do I get that risk that's what a cloud

25
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,270
access broker is a couple years ago we
started Gardner had to come up with a

26
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,790
name to figure it out we help them
through that process they were never

27
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,700
heard of Cloud Security Alliance CSA
it's a great organization and you should

28
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,489
really get to know them and understand
what they do

29
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,099
Jim Reavis is on our board of advisors
and he's helped us when we first started

30
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:30,780
the company and that was how do we
define what we should ask cloud services

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,620
in terms of questions like how should we
interrogate somebody that's providing

32
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,000
the service to us are they doing a good
job I think you know providing secure

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,680
means of access and where they located
all those kind of things you expect

34
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:52,569
smaller so if you look at it the average
enterprise today is running a thousand

35
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:57,519
cloud services it's a shocking number I
we do these preferred consoles for

36
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,440
people will take the logs from their
internal network just banging against

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,629
our database of known cloud services and
we'll find out how many cloud services

38
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,519
they're really running most people
believe it's around 5,200 we first meet

39
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,670
them and then once we do this we realize
there's a lot more to it a lot of people

40
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,209
ask me what is a cloud service you know
for stuff like what's the definition of

41
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,019
it to us a cloud services anywhere where
somebody can put your data log in right

42
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,379
you know they can access it with
username or password even anonymously

43
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,760
they can put your data and you don't
have any visibility control over its

44
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
outside of your not work outside here so
even Twitter would be a cloud service

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,049
because I can post photos from inside my
network or sensitive data right which

46
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,069
happens all the time so many different
things are cloud services

47
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:47,260
the average company has 94 high risk and
roll me my high risk is if you take a 50

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,459
. risk assessment score you know you
think update addressed the encrypted and

49
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,129
transmitted by they saw complain all the
things that you want to know some cloud

50
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,799
services court very poorly on something
like a bit torn you know are you know

51
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,049
there is a cloud service call can box
which nobody's ever familiar with if

52
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,810
you're going to quit and encourages he's
a steal all the information company

53
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,040
uploaded 2 I'm being can box there's a
cloud service force there's cloud

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,220
services out there are things

55
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,690
even imagine there's a cloud service for
that's what we mean by high risk and

56
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,580
typically we see at least that the day
temple tration abouts per quarter and

57
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,190
that's with customers that we see using
now recently in the news I'm sure you

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,340
guys off earlier with the you know the
anthem breach the Sony you know these

59
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,790
things that we've seen that's kind of
the challenger dana is moving out from

60
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,130
our network to the cloud

61
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,030
well the next challenges we have a lot
of data that lives there

62
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,990
you your corporation and you believe
that the state is yours you paid for

63
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,190
your employees are putting it there or
you're putting it there and now people

64
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,590
are accessing that data without ever
going to your network and there is no

65
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,320
visibility to it you might get up in the
cloud service but as I mentioned before

66
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,760
you have a thousand cloud services
running are you really gonna log into a

67
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,490
thousand cloud services admin councils
and go who did what try to correlate

68
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,720
that together so it gets to be very
typical 21% of the data that we see in

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,260
the cloud contains higher pH I typically
there's a hundred and forty-three files

70
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,490
when we do scans of data at rest in the
cloud that have stuff like the word

71
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,590
password and it recently did a scan for
a large corporation we found the CEO had

72
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,320
textiles violence passports inside a
cloud storage because it was convenient

73
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,950
you know people don't intend to do
things bad they just do it right and

74
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,530
when I first started we had about 1,200
cloud services and our database of known

75
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,229
cloud services today we have over 16,000
has only been a couple of years so what

76
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,600
happened was there is a little bit of
opportunity couple of years ago to use a

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,160
cloud application now there is a
gigantic opportunity everybody believes

78
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,790
when they go to work today if you're
going to start with a business starting

79
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,800
today there's gotta be a nap to do what
I'm trying to write this kind of the

80
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,640
mindset there's gotta be a nap to do
what the problem I'm facing I'm gonna go

81
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,310
to let find and install it and so they
don't even think its cloud they just

82
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,560
think of it as I want to use a nap and I
want to get something done what turns

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,740
out those apps typically put their data
in the cloud now that demonstrate no

84
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,280
exiting that 36% of files shared
externally and you know some of the

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,320
other stats 85% companies

86
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,510
anomalies in the canyon insider threat
and that could be somebody that's trying

87
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,030
to do something that or it could be a
machine that nobody caught an example

88
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,460
somebody had a Twitter account inside
their network it was twenty more treats

89
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,700
than a human being can get it was
nowhere in it was putting it together on

90
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,620
the outside once we did a time does it
was very small and people to notice so

91
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,710
those are the kind of things that we run
into and so what what has been created

92
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,300
as new space call the cloud access
broker in the idea is to put the control

93
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,490
point out at the cloud to give you that
visibility at the cloud providers so

94
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,980
that when I'm sitting here in this room
over network that has nothing to do with

95
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,230
my corporation if I'm using data that
you all in the cloud you get the

96
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,730
visibility to it as if it was inside
your pants that's what we're trying to

97
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,070
do is to bring the network that is here
to you and don't think of it as a

98
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,910
network anymore the way we think of it
as if you on that data is your identity

99
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,460
you know if you have access to it and
you paid for your you know when you sign

100
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,090
up for it then you step visibility into
it so think of it as the identity data

101
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,290
that you own should be protected forget
about the network it's really the day

102
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,220
right where's my data were right on it
and do I have this ability to it so the

103
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,800
purposes of texas poker is this ability
what am I using you know what's the risk

104
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
of that threat protection you know if
somebody's doing something the cloud

105
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,890
that they shouldn't be helped and I see
access to that and compliance this is

106
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,900
one that I touched on this a little bit
but compliance is really a big thing for

107
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,110
a lot of people right now trying to
figure out how do I B complain that

108
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,940
things are suddenly moving in places
that we don't even know where they're

109
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,620
going right so clients is another one
and the data security can I get that

110
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,470
data with my own he's been doing all
that it happens ability to what happened

111
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,470
to it so that's the that's the nut shell
of what this is you know the cloud

112
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,960
access broker Gardner said this is the
number one security technology of 2015

113
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,340
so this is topical so if if you're
thinking about what is important what is

114
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,000
Gardner talking about their talking to
your company's about or anybody that you

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,430
work for work with they're talking about
products is broken it's something you're

116
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,910
gonna hear often couple of years ago
when I started nobody even you know

117
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,640
there was a man named port which is that
how to protect the cloud outside right

118
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,170
but now they put a name on to it there's
a lot of people involved with it so

119
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,560
something that definitely pay attention
to

120
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,340
the way that if this is deployed the way
this works is there's a couple of

121
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,300
different ways that we can get this
Taylor access to the primary method is

122
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,980
cloud providers are now providing API's
or access controls that we can get

123
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,870
directly from the cloud provider so for
example we have relationships with box

124
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,470
sales worse than normal players that you
would expect so instead of you having to

125
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,270
go and install something on them or us
and install something on your network we

126
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,660
just gotta feed directly from that cloud
provider into a dashboard that you can

127
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,070
use to see what's happening today the
loss prevention that's kind of the

128
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,700
deployment architecture there is not a
planet anymore if you have an

129
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,779
administrator rights that service you
can put it into our cloud dashboard or a

130
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,600
card access brokers dashboard and now I
can see get visibility and and actually

131
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,980
take control and do stuff with the other
method that and then you need two

132
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,580
different methods there that is directly
to the cloud provider but for compliance

133
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,560
sometimes we can't let the day to go in
there and then have us to do lots of

134
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,610
ranch another figure out what happen
sometimes for compliance for him or for

135
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,040
health care and some other industries
you have to stop that data before it

136
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,670
even goes into that cloud service if
it's against your policy or something

137
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,050
that should be shared the other way we
do that as we actually do the identity

138
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,680
of the individual so when they go to
login that service do single sign-on

139
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,560
it'll look back and say okay with us
once protected with us a sky-high for

140
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,900
example our cloud access broker it'll
send it to a cloud-based reverse proxy

141
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,839
and then into that cloud service and
that's where the decryption of that trip

142
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,680
that data that's where you dey loss
prevention and you'll be able to stop so

143
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,540
then you can look at what's happening
and say oh this is a violation of our

144
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,310
policy you can stop that day warranty
right there so the kind of the primary

145
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,740
methods that we use to control the data
going into the clout and we can get any

146
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,170
questions

147
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,279
so one of the first to use cases that I
wanna go over is Ralph laura is now the

148
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,700
CEO of HP came from he was using Skype
for example o'clock someone came to HP

149
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,370
the first thing that he kind of coin
there's a lot of people never heard the

150
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,449
word channel ITV rebrand up a lot but
remember that I I like to joke that

151
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,120
shadow I T used to be somebody bring in
a server and stuffing out of their desk

152
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,130
that nobody asked about its a cloud
service now nobody is caring service

153
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,430
into work and plug it into the network
in san Tomas satellite TV help people

154
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,290
get a cloud service they don't know
about the use it and they'll tell me

155
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,610
about it is easy and because it goes
over encrypted web connections very hard

156
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,820
for employees to tell if your
insecurities are trying to figure it out

157
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,560
you don't know when someone and you
don't even know if it's really bad if

158
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,220
you have a proxy they'll put
kickasstorrents and one driving the same

159
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,970
category cloud storage and how would you
know which one is the the name is

160
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,389
obvious but if his name something like
the best five stories about securing the

161
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:34,269
world you would know it's bad you just
start right so that's that that concern

162
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:39,230
so what ralph does is every time someone
comes to my business units as we want to

163
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,329
use this new cloud service more
interested in the business unit says

164
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:47,240
this href this gonna save us a ton of
money and time and we want to use it

165
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,550
he's coming to terms shall I T which is
he goes to a sky-high dashboard our

166
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,660
cloud access broker he looks up in real
time where the cloud services those

167
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,760
employees are using and you can see here
it's one of those is ranked on a scale

168
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,240
of one to ten in terms of risk so the
risk assessments automatic been done and

169
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,949
he knows already using these cloud
services turns out this one is got a

170
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,890
really great security rating and more
people are using it to the one you want

171
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,329
me to use why aren't you guys using that
one half the time it's just they didn't

172
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:20,420
know they're even using it for
corporations are so big we have so many

173
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,019
people doing things in them there might
be a business on business unit that we

174
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,930
purchased that company purchased and
nobody even knew that they had an

175
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,810
application they're using it worked
really well right so that's the

176
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,449
collaboration for the benefit the old
way of doing it just to send a survey

177
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:37,340
out and ask everybody whether using
while I don't even remember what I

178
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,760
that's very difficult so having
something that can detect in real time

179
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,860
what people are using and how much day
is going to win this season is very

180
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,030
helpful that's one of the disabilities
and other visibility is Brian Lilley

181
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:55,440
he's the sea CIO next which is where
office 365 is hosted they use a method

182
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,580
where they do just in time

183
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,380
education so they had a problem where
people were not collaborating by cloud

184
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,340
storage at least they had about fifty
seven different cloud storage and use

185
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,810
and if everyone's using two different
cloud storage then we lose the point of

186
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,140
the collaboration of the cloud right
where the giant pile to each other

187
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,880
everybody is just using it as a personal
sort so he looked at that and he

188
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,500
integrated his cast me with this proxy
and that's a really important thing to

189
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,880
do is you can give your proxy the
intelligence of the cloud risk

190
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,010
assessments so what they do is if it's
outside of their policy of forced to

191
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,310
higher risk it pops up a message to
employees when they go to use the proxy

192
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,390
that says you should use this you know
here's our policy please use a simple

193
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,290
thing like education for people they
don't want to use a really bad cold

194
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,110
storage they just think that's what they
use right cuz they found that's really

195
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,400
helpful in helping people guide them to
where they should go and then this one

196
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,060
is really something I'm very passionate
about we have one of my customers

197
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,980
proctor and Gamble and they'll have over
700 times a year someone come to me and

198
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,100
say we want to use this cloud service
security team go back them right glass

199
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,880
demure 500 questions

200
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,600
figure out of their secure and then out
of the ten pick one that can take a

201
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,650
month sometimes I can take more we've
had customers like peridot and I've had

202
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,860
customers like Procter and Gamble those
local here that's where they'll say they

203
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,340
actually taken that time

204
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,120
90% reduction the time if somebody's
already done that risk assessment for

205
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,650
you like a cloud access broker they'll
go to the dashboard and sky-high look up

206
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,540
that cloud service all those risk
assessment answers already there if

207
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,060
there's questions I need to ask that are
on there had that to it

208
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,040
price of their team only has to do a
little bit of the work on top what sorry

209
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,400
they're not all the work to start with

210
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,870
this is something that I think is
extremely important I'm seeing every

211
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,100
company that I talked to this is really
important to them and being able to

212
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,860
figure that out and if you don't know
how to do this and if you say to the

213
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,640
people that are coming to that why use a
cloud service but we have no idea it's

214
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,950
going to take us three months to bet
that turns out the employees want to get

215
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,210
their job done so they'll just go use it
not tell you and that's why should white

216
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,210
chicks right shadow I T exist when I T
department is so difficult to work with

217
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,010
instead of enabling them they just cant
get used to have the time so if you can

218
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,940
find a store that has that stuff done
for you

219
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,960
it saves you the time and now you're
helping your neighbor Brian Lilley if

220
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,170
you google his name

221
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,110
chief enabler is what you get because of
his work with sky-high his goal was to

222
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,530
be the chief enabler not the chief
information officer that she helped them

223
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,250
and that is really I think the critical
way to think of it as an opportunity to

224
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,870
partner with the business units with
security and say well we don't have to

225
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,970
say no we can say instead of using this
one

226
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,660
use this right this technology if you
have that it becomes incredibly powerful

227
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,800
compliance is really important in there
some other examples like selling had a

228
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,470
requirement to do on demand skinny right
after the bridge that their customer and

229
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,530
one of their concerns we have stuff out
in the cloud we need something to go and

230
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,000
look in for the stuff that's already
sitting there apply our policies to it

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,970
is their Pio there is there something
sensitive and then grab that report

232
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,510
that's not the case

233
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,630
threat protection i think is the next
most important thing to think about and

234
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,860
to me threat protection is everyone is
probably familiar with the words no

235
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,560
event is on the news all the time and as
saying

236
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,170
took all their data from them a lot of
people still ask what how did the NSA

237
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,120
with other intelligence nothing how US
intelligence how do they not know four

238
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,200
days he was dumping data out to the
internet so much right to use copy the

239
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,400
reason is they were not running behavior
they were not running behavior learning

240
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,760
on what he was doing right so he was
allowed to

241
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,210
absolutely do whatever he wants the
nobody checking one use case after the

242
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,350
anthem preach we got a major health care
provider that wasn't same size and they

243
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,400
said

244
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,980
sky-high would have caught it because
what we do is we do behavior learning on

245
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,920
the cloud service so we have a duty to
model engine running in the cloud and we

246
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,630
have tens upon millions of data
transactions happening every second

247
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,470
so we'll do is we'll take several
million people using Facebook every day

248
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,940
and will do machine learning a what is a
normal user and what's an adenoma I'm

249
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,140
extremely passionate that behavior is
really the security that is the next

250
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,180
we're going to you because you're not
gonna be able to stop people from going

251
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,910
to cloud services you're not going to be
able to control them all but if you can

252
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,520
do the learning and behavior and figure
out what's abnormal and what's normal

253
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,270
that will alert you to the second
something happens I had a large Michigan

254
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,260
manufacturer I went to meet with the CIO
before he was gonna buy high and we

255
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,960
looked at this anomaly page right this
is the kind of the screen that you're

256
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,870
seeing there and I said well you got a
real problem so many movies 62 gigs to

257
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,250
Google Drive this morning that's to
outline right out of a hundred thousand

258
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,140
people that was the anomaly or the event
that showed up near the needle in a

259
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,440
haystack needle he's like yeah that was
me as trying to see if your stuff work

260
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,880
and great you know that's what I'm
looking for

261
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,870
so that's the kind of stuff that i think
is critical is who's watching the back

262
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,070
door who's watching your behavior and if
you can get a tool that automatically

263
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,290
watches every cloud services in news and
already has baseline that's the way to

264
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,590
effectively do that without having to
hire new people its really automation

265
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,010
the second thing is geographically you
can see threats and so one of the other

266
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,540
things that i think is a critical
feature in this was CIA

267
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,350
they were looking at issues that started
with the passwords being used across

268
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,010
geographies and so what this is is being
able to detect in this about thirteen

269
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,760
different behaviors that we can detect
now and this isn't behaviour learn from

270
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,430
your traffic if you have five hundred
people you can't do machine learning I

271
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,389
don't care what software you put in
place if I only had 10 people using

272
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:51,329
something like sendspace or storage I'm
not going to be able to do good machine

273
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:55,129
learning behavior analytics because that
fifth person is there's no one out there

274
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,329
it takes millions of people to really do

275
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:00,339
machine learning out what is bad
behavior and what's a good behavior

276
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,029
because we can tap into all that
behavior that we have we can do it we

277
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:08,019
can help you out that's a good cloud
access Rakesh do this one is the

278
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:11,379
Superman so many logs from China to a
cloud service with the same credentials

279
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,419
to login here with a few minutes that's
impossible we see a lot of people who

280
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,759
have hurt security and that's something
you wanted I'm running out of time here

281
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,349
a little bit so the last thing I wanna
talk about its compliance and will take

282
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,249
will take an example here

283
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:32,899
Lubrizol is a local machine Ohio
customer and so one of the things they

284
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:36,659
are looking for is there he had on
promised a loss prevention they wanted

285
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:42,209
to take that and apply it from the cloud
in and so as a cloud access broker we

286
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:45,700
could hand off those events to their on
premise deal peace they have to relearn

287
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,139
everything they can use existing tools
and just integrate with that bring that

288
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:54,079
it so with that I'm going to get into
the end of this is we're kind of running

289
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,009
low on time so from four years of
deploying this seminal earnings that

290
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,079
we've done far we've come into as you
cannot have friction for the users of

291
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,419
you apply something that has something
installed on their machine will never

292
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,700
work they have to not know that it's
happening all has to be done from

293
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,469
backend process straighter there you
have to leverage the existing

294
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:17,539
infrastructure and investment so if you
have something like powell out or if you

295
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,919
have websites leverage that use that to
apply this to it and add this into it

296
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,029
you gotta think of cloud access broker
as a new piece of technology these

297
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:32,609
include any are not necessarily get rid
of Technology this is that it's this and

298
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:36,440
then the last thing we have is these are
all in which we have this I think this

299
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,509
will be online so these are all people
that would be willing to talk to your

300
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:43,459
companies that have done this and are
willing to speak and they're they're

301
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:47,149
great references are leaders in the
corporations around the world they're

302
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,729
using products as brokers so this is a
great opportunity for companies to have

303
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,310
someone to talk to reach out to

304
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,530
and finally a call to action right you
can become an enabler in your business

305
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,320
what we typically will do to meet people
will say how do we take a couple weeks

306
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,210
of your logs were banging against this
product's broker tell you the visibility

307
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,910
of what you're doing the clout and then
give you a report that helps you make

308
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,460
decisions out well I am using the cloud
and maybe I should do something about it

309
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,090
maybe I shouldn't but this is how we
usually meet most people as it's a great

310
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,220
way to say all right with at least a
compliance report to see what are we

311
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,560
doing the cloud of what's the risk of so
many questions before we run out of time

312
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:36,450
here nobody I'm not there yet so I think
your time and be sure
