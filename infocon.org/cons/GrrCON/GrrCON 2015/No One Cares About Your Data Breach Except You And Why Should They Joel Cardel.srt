1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:15,779
all right thank her but her shown up my
name is Joel Cardella I'll give you some

2
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,820
info about me although you probably
don't care and that's ok

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,660
Joel IM's he's got a consultant at rapid
seven I've been in the business about

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,510
twenty years on me a little longer be a
little shorter depending on when you

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,369
start measuring and I've done a lot of
different stuff seen a lot of different

6
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,579
things it just came up again of being
the sea so level director of information

7
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,170
security for multinational manufacturing
organization for two years but have done

8
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,800
a lot of other stuff in my life and I
have seen some things that are somewhat

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,690
disturbing my guess is the best way to
put it in so when I talk about why

10
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,460
you're the only person concerned about
what you do that comes from a slightly

11
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,890
cynical place but also from a place of
some experience trying to deal with

12
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,450
security issues over the years and and
really not have them go the way that you

13
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,680
want to go to show you some things that
I believe contribute to that that

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
philosophy that thought and some things
that maybe we can do to get around that

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,270
so here we go

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,880
concerti now it's sort of a favorite
tactic of security people iPhone of

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,860
course is my wife she is the worst
timing ever 2013 Dow is a tool that

18
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,990
security people have used for a long
time to get decisions made but really we

19
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,840
cannot do this anymore because the
uncertainty in down certain does just

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,869
simply don't work as as tools they still
exist it's still a pain it still out

21
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,600
there I believe it's changed and I'll
talk about that change in a little bit

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,429
but we really have to get away from
thinking about things in broad terms and

23
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,380
really think about things more in terms
of how our businesses and our executives

24
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,940
are thinking about them so when we talk
about data breaches rate we talk about

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,670
the cost of data breaches and in 2015

26
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,959
what's a reporter but it was not a
report I just pick one month in this

27
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,540
case in they basically said that the
average record cost for a lost soul in

28
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,780
record is about a hundred and forty five
bucks in 20 4954 bucks in 2015 and they

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,420
figure out all kinds of things about
that what it costs to recover what it

30
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,989
costs in support when they break it down
and it's a good number I guess you can

31
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:42,630
use it as a number as a thing but what I
found when I talk to people in a lot of

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,640
organizations they don't really care
about that number doesn't really mean

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,200
anything when we talk about electronic
data they can't put a hard number around

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,090
it because when it comes to support
operations are things like this either

35
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,620
some costs companies are paying for
these anyway so executives don't look at

36
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,739
this as as a number that they have to be
concerned about maybe they should maybe

37
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,370
they shouldn't but you know it's
something that's out there it's at all

38
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,799
yet data out there so this is a street
capra privacy rights dot org which is a

39
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,670
web page that tracks all kinds of data
breaches is a great place to go because

40
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,459
you can do searches you can do lookups
and it gives you all kinds of good

41
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,820
information on stuff as you see I i ran
one here and most recent experience

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,280
reach 15 million records it was a hack
this is a code that they used that's

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,460
medical this is your business services
or something

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,970
and they tell you more about it that I
had to cut that off his mission there

45
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,290
but it's a really good resource to give
you data on data breaches and things

46
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,620
there's its sights like information is
beautiful

47
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,360
where they did some visualized in the
world's biggest data breaches and they

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,410
show you on this poll charged with the
size of the bubble represents a larger

49
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,950
breach in curse and everything else
right and you can even get that data and

50
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,490
you can look at instead of the east side
of the bridge you cannot put the data

51
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:04,750
sensitivity so while Adobe may have been
small in terms of size it was a large in

52
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,280
terms of sensitivity because PII got out
there right personally identifiable

53
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,610
information and that's the stuff we
really care about because the PII is

54
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,880
what's regulated that's what people have
to pay fines for they lose I have to

55
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,220
follow regulatory things right so you
can see all the stuff out the

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,470
information out there is sort of the
point here but we talked about the cost

57
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,710
of doing business and we talked about
you know oh you know a hundred and fifty

58
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,770
dollars a record right what does that
really mean what they really look like

59
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,560
so I was thinking about this at the same
time Dave Shackleford without a blog

60
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,430
post that I have stolen with impunity
and i really appreciate him doing all

61
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,210
this work for me so essentially what he
saying here is a look at some companies

62
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,500
who had large data breaches from the
information is beautiful sight and what

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,330
I did was I looked at when they
announced their data breach and I looked

64
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,720
at the price of their stop and then I
looked at what the price of their stock

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,750
is now as a result of this blog posts
right so many months ago

66
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,730
as you can see we have a fairly upward
trend for what is Heartland Heartland

67
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,410
Payment Systems had to be PCI breach
similar so this is TJMaxx right TJX they

68
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,580
had a brief announcement back in 2007
and this is what they look like today

69
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,310
and you see a pattern emerging here
right here's a Dolby we just looked at

70
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,280
Adobe Adobe had a big sensitive records
breach right this is what their stock

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,500
price look like somewhere around $50 it
somewhere around $80 today and what is

72
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:44,150
that 50% little more than 50% piers
Global Payments another PC I write the

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,560
announcer breach in 2012 this is what it
looks like today

74
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,910
their stock was hovering around 40 in
its like almost a hundred so whatever

75
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,280
they're doing they're doing alright just
their shareholders love them then of

76
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,960
course there's target you've all heard
about now i cant talk bad about target

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,970
because our Archon hosts were target but
it's the same kind of thing in November

78
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,310
of 2014

79
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,660
they had a breach and thus what they
look like today

80
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:18,440
ok so where is the pain and suffering as
a result of these data breaches we know

81
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,830
they pay fines we know that they have
all of these costs to clean up

82
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,460
break targets writing away but security
awareness right now where they're

83
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,620
pumping millions and millions of dollars
into their security program but it looks

84
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,350
like this

85
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,770
the question many executives mine would
be why do we need to do that when I look

86
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,720
at this and it's kind of all summed up
by eight we need my space road where he

87
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,660
says that had 1.2 billion in dividends
on 28 points 9.8 billion in sales for

88
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,020
2014 and the data breach costs a hundred
and sixty-two million that's the cost of

89
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,640
doing business right cuz it is that the
cost of doing business they took

90
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,310
whatever percentage of that I'm terrible
at math right not ten percent 1%

91
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,610
whatever it is

92
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,479
off of their profits said oh yeah we had
this day to be made to deal with this

93
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:18,060
year in the Sun cost Colin and moved on
but there are other costs and because

94
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,689
it's been fairly boring up to this point
now I'm going to entertain you with

95
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:26,409
Futurama so good is everyone the
professor create a device which makes

96
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:30,909
you read these in his voice so we're
gonna look at two specific instances

97
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:35,210
we're gonna look at the joy of Ashley
Madison ever gonna look at the joy of

98
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,949
Sony Pictures both of which suffered
significant breaches far beyond the

99
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,020
financial implications of what it did to
the company's one company is going to be

100
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,340
out of business the other one is going
strong I'll let you decide which right

101
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,930
information fire hose troves of
information were released on the inner

102
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,300
workings of these companies this is what
our executive should be afraid it's not

103
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,569
about how much money we pay out it's not
it's not about a paper record amount of

104
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:10,699
what it costs us it's about our our
secrets being exposed in these data

105
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,300
breaches because that really is where
the meat of this problem right it's not

106
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,849
just about reputation it's about real
and actual business secrets how we do

107
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:25,550
business how we get around the law right

108
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:31,349
shady ways they had exposed in this if
you look really hard so let's take

109
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,399
Ashley Madison for example a bit like
media the parent company of Ashley

110
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,440
Madison is accused of having thoughts on
their site where these fam box went out

111
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,970
and chatted up the membership and caused
them to purchase transactions to chat

112
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:52,320
more right there was a website Gizmodo
wrote it out one of the great quotes

113
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,430
from the article there is it's like a
science fictional future where every

114
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,660
woman on earth is dead in some don't
like engineer has replaced them with

115
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,820
badly designed robots that stuff but
it's a company secrets that's a big deal

116
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,709
we could have suspected that was
happening because the data breach we can

117
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,310
prove that it was happening and if you
read that article she goes through some

118
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,329
steps where she offers some pretty
significant proof

119
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:23,470
there's also the fact that they have
their competitors so they're CTO but

120
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,360
here says in an email back to the CEO
they did a very lousy job building their

121
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,290
platform I got their entire user base
included a message with the link to

122
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,929
their get I can turn any non paying user
into a user vice versa can you say

123
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:45,089
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act these are
blatant violations of the right crap

124
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,279
sorry about that one

125
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:54,149
you can read about it pretty interesting
nearly 200,000 emails written by the CEO

126
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:00,559
know by were made public and we found
that she was possibly having an affair

127
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,360
shocker right we found that he wanted to
brag about their security when he saw

128
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,059
other sites getting hacked ironic we
found out he was trying out new ways to

129
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:18,290
defraud people he was trying to create
this is in an email

130
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,350
a scheme to pump and dump stocks pump
and dump is where we artificially

131
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,319
inflate the price of a stock that we
have purchased we tell other people

132
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:31,309
about it so that price goes up we sell
our stop when it's hi everybody else

133
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:36,069
takes the fall that's illegal and the
irony of a man who starts a cheating

134
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:42,730
site wanting to do a scheme called pump
and dump is not lost on me right you

135
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,629
read about it here

136
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:49,220
Business Insider an interesting story
about Ashley Madison oh let's really

137
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,559
talk about problems talk about Sony
zoning out again if you look at privacy

138
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,110
rights dot org O show you how many time
sony has been hacked I think it was six

139
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,449
and that's important to remember in a
little bit 47,000 social security

140
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:09,389
numbers including those of famous actors
like Sylvester Stallone right whatever

141
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:12,059
the publicly available

142
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,160
bank statements tax forms and 401k
information all available in this half

143
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,089
not to mention business documents they
can be viewed by anybody with a text

144
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:24,070
editor that's also important to remember
for later

145
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:31,940
we found plain text files with passwords
this is an actual screen cap up a bunch

146
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,600
of it's kind of hard to read but I give
you the the the some of these filenames

147
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,570
ABC past where fifty new user passwords
ninety-day admin password might be good

148
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,550
to look at let's see what else do we
have here there's one on here there's

149
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,460
like bank passwords

150
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,600
just sitting on a PC this is what we
found in the hat and the day that was

151
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,000
done these are actual files by the way
that's a screencap of what the files

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,700
look like we found pricing data we know
what they spend on stuff in this is huge

153
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,670
especially with movie theaters are
asserting that we theaters movie

154
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,580
companies companies that make movies
this is a big deal because have you ever

155
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,600
heard that movie will grossed three
hundred million dollars but not make a

156
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,760
profit right you know that works that
way

157
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,460
hollywood accounting hollywood
accounting is where everybody inside the

158
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,680
industry buys from each other so they
never make a profit but this exposes

159
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,700
that it shows exactly what each business
unit paid for everything and it shows us

160
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,890
how they really actually do make profits
but because they use the shell game

161
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,730
called hollywood accounting they can
hide behind it

162
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,750
this is a big deal this has been going
on in Hollywood for decades

163
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,850
everybody knew it but this is the proof
that's significant they had internal

164
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,430
salary data came out and this caused a
huge deal because it started to

165
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:02,290
illustrate the disparity in gender gap
hey at Sony now in this particular case

166
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,340
Amy Pascal and Michael Lynton made the
same amount of money Michael minister

167
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,230
president Sony Pictures Entertainment
Amy Pascal was right there to rate at

168
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,870
his level she did like content
management things they don't mean three

169
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,700
million a year but all the other people
on here at 2.8 million down you can see

170
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,020
what their salaries are there probably
not very happy about that now that we

171
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,900
can see that

172
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:31,140
right they had helped her protected data
are redacted some of it but this is a

173
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,420
plane's spreadsheet that their H R
Department held showing when the

174
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,530
employees had to go out on short term
disability and what reason they went out

175
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:46,670
on short term disability for sitting
right there in the art department if you

176
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,060
work for a large company you're a char
department has this data they do they're

177
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,490
required to keep it by law the required
to secure it they're not always sort of

178
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,010
but they're not right

179
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:06,780
Sony internal a char data here's a memo
about an executive who took romantic

180
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,910
trip to the subordinate employee on the
company's died and didn't get fired

181
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:17,970
that's the memo if it was bigger you
could read it it's redacted someone but

182
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,150
you could read that memo all this
information is in the Sony treasure

183
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,540
trove you can find out who this person
is who the person is that they were

184
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,430
fraternizing with what they did

185
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,390
allegedly given the benefit of the doubt
rate

186
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,710
and the kinds of other juicy stuff we
are to talk about the spreadsheet about

187
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,990
the stuff they're their social security
numbers their entire payroll division by

188
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,550
division was there all the employees who
were fired or laid off in 2014 as part

189
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,130
of the company's reorganization detailed
performance reviews for hundreds of Sony

190
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,850
Pictures employees detailed reports of
medical needs and absences in the reason

191
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,060
a file with the highest costs patients
on the Sony Pictures health plan

192
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,680
contains a laundry list of expensive
chronic conditions who had cancer heart

193
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,170
disorders and end-stage renal disease if
you're one of those people do you want

194
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:18,650
that out there I'm guessing you don't
but again the company is required to

195
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,350
keep this information because you're on
their health plan they're just not

196
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:29,540
securing obviously internal memos
executive misconduct we saw information

197
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,360
on Deloitte's salaries this was good so
delighting to she was there auditor

198
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,840
information to let salaries from an
employee who was formerly with Deloitte

199
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,790
but it seemed all the data on in Sony
Computer and Sony never got rid of it so

200
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,560
this really wasn't even sony's fault it
was just an asset in their control that

201
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,730
wanted meeting data in their control
that got out

202
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,170
delayed salaries consultants are stupid
and they don't segregate client data I

203
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,310
blame that one underway but it's only
problem because it went up in their data

204
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:11,630
trail and out of when they got reached
this is my comment is also Michael into

205
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,380
it you know anything about hedonism

206
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,710
in a December 2014 interview with
National Public Radio litman and

207
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,650
insisted his company was extremely
well-prepared for conventional

208
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:30,110
cybersecurity but faced the worst attack
cyberattack NUS history that is a really

209
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,910
really important comment will talk about
that he has repeatedly described as a

210
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,860
highly sophisticated attack what we
might call Ekiti and then I'll at Sony

211
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,090
Pictures provided written responses to
questions questions to Robert Lawson he

212
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:52,700
says clinton has no plans to fire or
discipline anyone ok this is 2040 the

213
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,540
CEO's reasoning rests on the belief that
the because of his assailant was a

214
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,900
foreign government was far more
resources than a renegade band of

215
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,470
hackers what happened was unstoppable
the suit studio simply paste an unfair

216
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,140
fight ok that's fine but let's break
this down let's look at these words

217
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,120
extremely well-prepared for conventional
cybersecurity in other words we passed

218
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,670
our last audit rate the worst cyber
attack in USC history and they'd had

219
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,100
congresspeople agree with them that's a
really important comment because

220
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,720
basically that allows them to transfer
the risk all away from them and go we

221
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,260
had no choice we were being outnumbered
not believe what could we do congress

222
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,020
goes yeah you're right

223
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,330
accountable he was a highly
sophisticated attack no it wasn't look

224
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,660
at look at what happened somebody got
fish somebody got they got in they

225
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,960
pivoted they got all the data the
external traded it in so you never knew

226
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,370
that is not highly sophisticated that's
what script kiddies do they have no

227
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,010
plans to fire discipline anyone that's
really interesting

228
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:05,150
let's look at Jason's Paltrow the VP of
information security at Sony that may or

229
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,730
may not be an accurate representation of
Jason's felt the cost now this is these

230
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,270
are quotes from from mister smelt Roe in
an article for CIO magazine in 2007 7

231
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,120
years before the bridge the cost to
harden the legacy database against a

232
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,130
possible intrusion could come to 10
million the cost to notify customers in

233
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,310
case of a breach might be one million
with those peak years it's a valid

234
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,300
business decision to accept the risk of
a security breach I will not invest ten

235
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,370
million to avoid a possible one million
loss

236
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,500
here's the problem he's right you would
be foolish would be stupid as a business

237
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,100
to invest ten million dollars to
preserve one million dollars in assets

238
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,310
that ROI is not present in our alliance
return on investment rate that is not

239
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,830
yet that is so negative it's ridiculous
you would not ever do that he's

240
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,040
absolutely right he goes on to say their
decisions that have to be made

241
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,050
we're trying to remain profitable for
shareholders we could literally go book

242
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,710
broke trying to cover for everything

243
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,760
agreed so you make risk-based decisions
what are the most important things

244
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,310
underline that are absolutely required
by law

245
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:25,300
those two parts of that sentence do not
go together the most important things

246
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,460
are not the things absolutely required
by law

247
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,730
me speaking right but this is somebody
who is focused on compliance focused

248
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,670
focused focused on checking the boxes
getting the audits done and getting off

249
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:44,890
his desk in 2004 users are still able to
use passwords such as skateboard 94 for

250
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:50,060
their public places we know this because
we can look at the password files that

251
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,060
we don't we stole great we can see this

252
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,750
have they progressed absolutely not have
a regressed very likely they're

253
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:07,770
certainly making good dollar decisions
right here is a friendly reminder to

254
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,080
mister spell Cheryl to anyone who will
listen that if the data represents you

255
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,800
you are the owner of that data if it is
your name your address your PII you own

256
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,550
that data because you are responsible
for generating companies who hosts it

257
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,190
collected by it from a clearing house or
otherwise are merely custodians of that

258
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,520
data there is a significant difference
between a day to honor and added a

259
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,580
custodian as a custodian they have a
fiduciary responsibility to the data but

260
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,000
they also have financial obligations to
their investors and shareholders guess

261
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,790
who wins

262
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,450
gonna be investors and shareholders
every time every time until there is

263
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,120
significant serious regulation the
forces it to be the other way around

264
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:03,790
depression so the costs of acceptable
risk so you just put together a little

265
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,270
blog post that was interesting and they
posit some of the the the cost that they

266
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,190
thought this would cost Sony this was
right after the bridge was announced

267
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,970
before really knew what those things
where they basically say they're going

268
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,340
to pay for the initial incident response
card industry rates are approximately

269
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,800
three to five hundred dollars an hour
per consultant depending on the response

270
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,610
time the retainer that's absolutely true

271
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,320
ongoing security reviews gap assessments
reassessments hiring of external

272
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,510
security experts for the security
committee counsel roles likely to occur

273
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,020
next 12 to 36 months that is happening
now in the breach data there been a

274
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:41,320
minimum of six business agreement
documents that appear to have kept up

275
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,880
for health and human services or
healthcare components there's gonna be

276
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
business lines now because of that
because they violate HIPAA rules they're

277
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,150
going to pay hit pages heh as fines for
all the PII did expose California and

278
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,330
other states have their own finds in
addition to the federal typifies there's

279
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,160
gonna be ongoing credit monitoring which
there is

280
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,630
and is going to be employee lawsuits
which there was at least two both tried

281
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,990
to submit his class action both got
settled wow just got settle that happen

282
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:20,290
to doing business that's how it happened
so hows Sony doing today let's look at

283
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,950
their stock price anyone want to guess
where that is it up or is it down do we

284
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:32,020
know drum roll it up right here right
here on the bridge was announced this is

285
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:39,010
the day that they went public and it was
roughly $21 in some sense today here at

286
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,350
$26 in some sense we're not quite a year
out the other grass I showed you were

287
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,520
several years

288
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,810
activity but that's still 20 to 25
percent increase their stock price from

289
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:56,700
when their breach was announced to where
they are now what are they doing wrong

290
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:05,240
by looking at this you can tell right so
again in my opinion fund has kind of

291
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,890
changed to an acronym that I like to
call air which is apathy indifference

292
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,630
and resignation and that's the approach
we have now to how the state of stuff

293
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,350
happens in its approach everybody has
the public has security people it just

294
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,840
keeps happening over and over and over
again

295
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,180
you rub your head and you go okay it's
another one fine I guess you know let's

296
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,680
keep sucking his that's what we're doing
that's a difference i mean you know what

297
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:39,420
are our choices it's really it's really
hard to show you a few things when I was

298
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,900
a sea so they didn't work

299
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:47,010
ok so this is the what not to do section
basically don't ever refer to securities

300
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,930
insurance model we already have enough
problems right now with the cyber

301
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,730
insurance industry the cyber insurance
industry is making all of this reality

302
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,850
it's making air or reality because
companies now just wipe their hands

303
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,090
right transfer that risk were done let's
move on to something else

304
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,880
the breach happens we all get screwed
insurance pays out the company for the

305
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,400
costs of remediation and we're all still
screwed right

306
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,550
so cyber insurance I really have a
problem with right now because it's just

307
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,600
exacerbating problems if you are Chris
Roberts keno ami started the first day

308
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,760
he talked about what it actually takes
to get cyber insurance today and it's

309
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,030
like a three question questionnaire read
it right

310
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,410
give security firewall do you have
audits

311
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,160
don't use standard that don't match your
industry or don't use Apple Store as

312
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,400
comparison I tried doing this I was
working in manufacturing I was trying to

313
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,260
use other industries to say look you
know they do this in finance do this in

314
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,900
health care and they do this in
education and you know didn't have any

315
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,440
any gear store they didn't care

316
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,010
didn't care that they were best
practices out there even though all of

317
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,510
those standards covered us get here so I
discovered you get a call Wednesday from

318
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,880
a jar and they say here we have an
auditor here can you help us and I was

319
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,220
the point protectorate as I went down I
said you know how can I help you and

320
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,400
they said we're here to do it he said he
bought it and we're we're manufacturing

321
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,400
company we don't have to but it turns
out we did the same reasons I showed you

322
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,770
before there's a chart has to keep
records in collections up everything

323
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,470
that happens when people go out and
disabilities we did have hit it on the

324
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,330
network of which I had no exposure or
understanding more knowledge and as a

325
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,860
result we had to go through hip hop
audit which can you guess how we did not

326
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:39,360
do well he Mackin said we will fix that
and we did and that was good but this

327
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,400
exists today people don't realize that
right if your publicly traded company

328
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:51,690
you got socks you got there's another
one for PC I was going to be taking

329
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,610
credit card data PCI writers all the
stuff that's out there that you may not

330
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,310
be aware of its all part of what needs
to happen we talk about data and that

331
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,070
don't confuse compliance with security

332
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,890
the big thing I'm trying to change in
the industry right now as I'm trying to

333
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,430
get people to talk about security as
other things because right now in the

334
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,970
mind of the public in the mind of the
everyman in Mineville aiman security is

335
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,480
this sort of thing that people do and
it's a nuisance and it's a bird and I

336
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,910
want to try to change the language and
get us to places where it's not a

337
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,630
nuisance in a burden that its think
things that people think about so

338
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,180
separate those words define him
differently and use them in different

339
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:33,240
contexts and what exactly is the right
number will tell us try different things

340
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,800
so when I say pivot here I'm saying be
really really obvious that you're

341
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,810
changing the discussion when you're
talking about the stuff with people move

342
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,720
away and they say oh you know security
say no no that's not security that's

343
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,730
actually risk when they say oh we need
to do this through security that's

344
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,030
that's actually governess that's not
security we still do it that's our

345
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,410
responsibility that's actually
governance not security talk about these

346
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:03,560
things as to what they are great
understand ROI because ROI is a really

347
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,860
big motivator for your executives
managers not just financial but all the

348
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,160
way around here talk about return on
investment what we investing what's the

349
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,010
return it's not always tangible
sometimes its intention ok

350
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,830
a really simple ROI calculations there
if x is less than why you're positive

351
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,600
effects is greater than what your
negative effects equals why you should

352
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,240
reevaluate and don't always think that
negative ROI is a bad thing actually

353
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,830
works for you if you can show a case
regional you know what we're paying

354
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,420
boatloads of money for this thing and
we're really not getting a lot of value

355
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,740
out of it maybe if we didn't pay for
that and we instead paid for something

356
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,630
over here which gets better value so
negative ROI can actually work for you

357
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,690
to but it requires you to be aware of
where you're spending your money we're

358
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,870
spending your time and your resources in
proved that return on investment bank

359
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,330
and you have other ROI to its very very
complex they need their own models and

360
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,810
that everything unfortunately can be
still down to mathematical formula but

361
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,030
it's a really really really good mindset
to have when you're talking to people

362
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,710
make the conversations about risk
completely turn the tables great treat

363
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,390
cybersecurity as a business risk I break
security down into four areas security

364
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,360
governance risk and compliance it's a
really easy to define these things

365
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,900
security does these things

366
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,880
governance does these things risk does
these things compliance does these

367
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,720
things

368
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,810
you talk about them and when somebody
comes to you and says oh this thing for

369
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:34,360
security compliance but what do you need
to talk about that change their their

370
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,020
mindset get them to understand what
you're trying to say go to your business

371
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,210
find out how they assess risk because I
guarantee they do in some way shape or

372
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,120
form when you have a formal risk
assessment process model or not they are

373
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,050
doing risk assessments because the other
figuring out where to drive their

374
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,860
business direction how to spend their
money what products to invest in

375
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,280
etcetera right so show you exactly what
they're used to see they're used to

376
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,980
seeing the stuff cropped up in front of
them by your business use their scene

377
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,070
templates use their same format used
their same color scheme for st. branding

378
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,270
right use the tools that they have to
your advantage it sounds funny to use

379
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,470
the same color set I guarantee you it
gets played guarantee you engage your

380
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,350
peers and superiors unrest talk about
what's an immediate use sites like

381
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,090
privacy rights dot org or have been
pulled and show them these things oh

382
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,750
yeah you know this is how here use it as
a generation material don't ever let a

383
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,540
crisis go on exploited rate that's a
really important thing

384
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,360
exploit your crises to your advantage
but not using fun but will get you

385
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,840
nowhere you exploit the crises to
illustrate the problem and then say how

386
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,820
do we deal with the problem let's look
at it in terms of risk and that's really

387
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,950
where ry is gonna start going to start
you start having conversations you need

388
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,340
to build a path to leadership need to
get there and it's not always a ladder

389
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,200
sometimes it's a journey but you need to
get there

390
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,720
prepare reports about what's going on in
the industry around you in circulate

391
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,890
them 82 hey you might have heard about
this new thing

392
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,200
heard about you know hardly sold but you
know I'm saying right you might have

393
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,470
heard about this if you're bold you
might have heard about Ashley Madison

394
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,350
try it see what happens create a
newsletter like a security news letter

395
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,650
circulated around get people talking
about it however you can get it out

396
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,600
there get it out there so people know
whether it's a blog post over there is

397
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,000
an actual form a forum on a bulletin
board it doesn't matter because the more

398
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,450
you communicate

399
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,610
more year in front of them the more
responsive they're gonna be when you

400
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,040
really want to engage them on something
you want to engage this is incredibly

401
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,430
important keep them in the know with
things that you know off your next level

402
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,960
manager of the managers and other
departments or just people around you I

403
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,170
mean start the conversation but you're
really getting are awash in your

404
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:01,160
discussion we're doing ok learn from the
mistakes of others

405
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,930
absolutely that's why I spent so much
time talking about Sony because you can

406
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,520
all that stuff how you can go yeah you
know this is the kind of stuff they did

407
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,910
wrong they had an email retention policy
that left up to seven years of old

408
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,550
messages on their servers and encrypt it
should that's one of your lawyers they

409
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:23,070
will let the freak out seven years of
messages they wouldn't liederman right

410
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:29,100
away right plausible deniability they
had they were essentially using their

411
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,080
email system their long-term document
storage because the email system was

412
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,640
backed up

413
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,800
made some people eat crap in their in
boxes in billions of different folders

414
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,670
and it gets a document management
systems now documents need to expire

415
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:50,570
they need to expire right your company
has retention policies an array of

416
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,400
sensitive information including
usernames and passwords were kept in

417
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,290
unprotected spreadsheets and word files
with names like computer passwords show

418
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,960
them that I only got half yeah there's
all this stuff is one of the things they

419
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,020
did you know we're doing the same thing
and we can we not do that have those

420
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,540
discussions you get approved ROI start
doing that and be prepared to answer

421
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,990
questions this is really important
questions thrown at you so you need to

422
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,670
understand your day they need to know
what it takes to protect it but let

423
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,460
somebody else make the risk decision and
that's really important thing a lot of

424
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,700
security managers in this position but
are asked to make risk decisions on

425
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,930
security type items that is not what we
should be doing the risk managers

426
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,430
security manager should take it back to
their business back to their boards

427
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,730
their exact there whoever is a decision
makers and say this is what I discovered

428
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,700
these are options can you please tell me
what the best option would be what would

429
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,320
you prefer to do and are most likely
gonna say to you was gonna cost the

430
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,020
least amount of time and money and
what's going to get the most bang for

431
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,130
our buck you're gonna already going
there were those options and know that

432
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:58,050
you're probably even know what they're
gonna pick because when you have control

433
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,420
of what's being reported you know you
can make something stand out with some

434
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:08,110
creative wording right if you want
option B make ANC look really crappy Hey

435
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,460
You sites like have been pwned privacy
rights that or keep your data lookup

436
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,960
media accounts of various activities
right whatever you whatever you can do

437
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
all that stuff I showed you from Sony
was 11 from one single media article

438
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,030
right so somebody has done the legwork
for you go out there

439
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,620
gather that data use it to your
advantage and show it as I'm learning

440
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,730
from the mistakes of others and showing
you what this is all about and then

441
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,750
network I mean you're here which is
awesome that's awesome but keep it up if

442
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,590
this is the only security conference to
go to this year it's not enough you need

443
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,120
to keep up the network there's Twitter
which is a big security community

444
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,060
there's my sexy is anybody here does not
know what my second is when they talked

445
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,680
about it there's a couple of people so
my SEC is a group of people including

446
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,990
myself they meet monthly fee in
Southfield which is like the Detroit

447
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:05,970
metro area there's also my sick Jackson
meats in jackson michigan and anywhere

448
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,990
else is just a community of people with
the same kind of pots night years and

449
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,740
temperaments and we come together
monthly and we have somebody present we

450
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,280
learn

451
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,470
right or if we don't learn you know we
talk about what's going on and try to

452
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,159
learn from each other but but it's
really all about making the connection

453
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,300
in getting the understanding common
understanding and everybody has their

454
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,600
farm discussions there's there's just
asking questions just ask questions

455
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,299
hey you know this thing ever seen as how
do you do this where you work there is

456
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:41,880
slight and no its latest deal with
integrity and pride right do it if it's

457
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,870
out there in the public do it the only
thing I ask use if somebody did it and

458
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,320
it's not your workout represented as
your own give attribution but absolutely

459
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,620
say here are some stuff that I found
that's really interesting that sort of

460
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:56,750
applies to what we do and you know it's
it's good stuff you know let's use it or

461
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,380
use it in your materials are your
security newsletters or whatever use

462
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,460
that material and this is really where
our allies gonna get a chance and in

463
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,850
speaking of Swype I mean introduced into
three pieces of collateral that i'm

464
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:13,450
gonna absolutely give to you ok send me
an email to my email address and I will

465
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,430
send these usually find them useful many
people have done so there are four

466
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,360
pillars security governance risk and
compliance are broken down into poor

467
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,970
areas I said here in their key functions
here's how we achieve those key

468
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,930
functions and here's the business value
of those functions you can have this

469
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,900
just send me know here's another piece
where I took the critical success

470
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,820
factors for the security organization
their key activities 30 interfaces and

471
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,220
our guiding principles but I said we
never make a decision without going back

472
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,970
to the guiding principles that's our
security constitution and we say when we

473
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,410
need to do something insecurity or
governance risk compliance and we need

474
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,970
to spend money or we need to take an
action does it fit within our principles

475
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,250
and if it doesn't we don't do it

476
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,530
executives know that they hear that
that's really good right that's are

477
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,480
locked solid tank

478
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,790
and this which turned out to be a
horrible color scheme because of the

479
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:10,860
humidity is so ignore that is just a a
layered model of visual model than using

480
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,240
to try to get these folks to understand
the fence in right that's what this is

481
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,610
this represents defense in depth and
it's really simple and I go look we

482
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,440
perimeter defenses we've managed
security services and Internet detection

483
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,670
and we have firewalls viruses and then
users will have access controls

484
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,570
critical business data so now you got
some talking points when they say well

485
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,350
you know why did this failure was
because the end user click something

486
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,410
that they click something you can see
that they went all through all of bees

487
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:42,330
and that was the problem now luckily we
had some access control so they can get

488
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,830
everything but you know we didn't have
that I would be a big deal are critical

489
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:53,840
data don t be another 70 right again I
get to see it it's out there you can

490
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,610
find it to help more than happy to mail
it to go to some final thoughts on all

491
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:05,460
this your job is to lower risk as your
job as a security person as a

492
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,110
practitioner as a manager as an
executive as a whatever your job is to

493
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:13,990
lower the risk of doing business so the
business can do more and better business

494
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:20,300
do so using positive ROI or negative ROI
to shift your budget from one place to

495
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,760
another that is posit emotionally detach
yourself from the things that drive you

496
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,690
nuts and I can't stress this enough you
will go crazy because if you beat your

497
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:34,650
head on the door over and over and over
about my god these data breaches and

498
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,190
it's gonna happen to us any day it's
just gonna burn you out

499
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,410
gonna burn you out you're going to be
done gonna be spent and it's not worth

500
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,640
it you have to emotionally detach
yourself I understand everybody wants to

501
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,350
do a really good job if the company is
stopping you from doing a really good

502
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:56,570
job you take the Kenny Rogers route
Hold'em know when to fold em know when

503
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,560
to walk away and you know when to run
sometimes that's what it takes I had to

504
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,530
do I was almost three years as see so
and I said I can't do it anymore they're

505
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,390
just not this

506
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:12,260
she got understand you're an adviser and
a counselor you should never ever ever

507
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,540
deeper if I look to you as a gatekeeper
change that perception have the

508
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,930
conversation I don't want to be a
gatekeeper I'm not your gate keeper

509
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,890
because gatekeepers make decisions on
what you do with your data it's not my

510
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:28,370
data it's your data so let me advise you
let me count so you let me help you on

511
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:34,800
what to do with that your business can
do business without security they can

512
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,960
it's very high risk if they can do it
you always have to keep that in mind

513
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,270
right that it's very often seen as a
necessary evil

514
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:49,660
necessary that's up to how risky your
executives want to treat your business

515
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:58,120
what they want to do so what do you do
so here's my information please feel

516
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,900
free to take it down i didnt talking to
you about anything anytime anywhere

517
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,350
give me an e-mail you may call whatever
you outta questions

518
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:26,290
risk framework yeah I think that's so
that ross is a financial bring more gray

519
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,240
or buying security products and to the
right thing

520
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,080
ok yet so I have seen that before but
like I said your your ROI is not always

521
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,880
going to be about dollars it might be
about investments in awareness rate

522
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,740
which could be all internal you don't
have to contract with third-party

523
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,710
company although if you'd like to you
please call me I'm more than happy to

524
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:50,180
help you that we don't have to do that
you could do stuff internally so right

525
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,080
reading program deliver program it's
gonna cost you resources internally to

526
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,790
do that but not really hard dollars in
losses more about called karnal expand

527
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:05,320
yeah exactly it's a blend of qualitative
good way to put it right and so in so

528
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,410
some of those qualitative kinds of
discussions of the ones that you really

529
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,920
want to have one state of still
important in Iraq because you know when

530
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,520
security vendors are saying oh that'll
be $275,000 that product you got to have

531
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,670
a really good reason for spending money
but you should have some qualitative

532
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:25,130
efforts in there as well if not you know
metrics although I admit this but

533
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:30,670
definitely be a thing you know you could
use that to your advantage the Rossi

534
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,690
from the Australian from the DSD

535
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,130
from the defence signals Directorate if
you have any questions

536
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:46,230
ok let me leave you with one final thing
so this is something that I used before

537
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,569
that's that's pretty interesting and
powerful as a picture that I found on

538
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:55,849
the internet and this picture here okay
you'll see this picture what's going on

539
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:03,280
is this gentlemen this is probably from
the sixties me the fitly fifties but he

540
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,240
has on a pair of rollerskates which are
powered by gasoline which is kept in a

541
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,250
tank that he strapped to his back he's
obviously businessperson because he's

542
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,130
holding a briefcase and I'm assuming
that he just wants to get to work really

543
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,680
fast or really cool right

544
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,050
this is probably what this gentleman
wants to do now this is your visual

545
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:29,560
analogy 44 what's going on in your world
this is your business they want to strap

546
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,470
on gas powered roller skates and they
want to go down the street

547
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,710
really really fast break they want to
strap it to the back they want to use

548
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:42,770
leaded gasoline to do it and you s
security person have to look at that and

549
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:49,220
go hey that's what you want to do if
your first inclination is don't do that

550
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:55,630
you're going to die you think we have to
say to them is that's really really cool

551
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:01,540
can offer you a health or something just
to to help you with that because it

552
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:06,079
seems like it'd be a little risky just
do it the way your do you hear that

553
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,069
makes sense that's the kind of
discussion you have to have used these

554
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:14,609
visuals use this one if you want like I
said I stole this from is a great a

555
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,079
Twitter account called historical pics
in a tweet stuff all the time on the red

556
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,849
line stuff I grabbed it and I try to use
it use analogies but this one is

557
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:26,380
fantastic it's the it's yours and I say
I say this is either the worst example

558
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,040
of risk management I've ever seen or
it's the greatest example of risk

559
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,700
acceptance I've ever see it's one of
those two and you have to decide where

560
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,280
you're at you have to decide how you're
gonna have but that's the reality of

561
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,450

breaches me talk about how tough they

562
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,740

with

563
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,290

out a way to make him listen to go
