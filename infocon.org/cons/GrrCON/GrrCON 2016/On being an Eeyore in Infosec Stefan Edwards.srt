00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good afternoon</font>

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,309
everyone

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,109
this talk is on being<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in infosec</font>

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:19,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm actually Stephanie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Edwards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go by</font>

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">twitter handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">usual sort of like adjectival bullshit</font>

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,189
that people give about themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,500
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I basically do a large number</font>

9
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,079
of things and I do application security

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some network stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coding etc</font>

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,260
and i'm pretty much all over the place

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">so although</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> envision themselves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">much an application security company</font>

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,210
this talk is basically on how everything

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">in four seconds terrible not just</font>

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,950
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely is easy enough to</font>

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,710
pick on<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can find all sorts of things</font>

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,000
that are wrong with<font color="#CCCCCC"> AB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sec entirely but</font>

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">i thought i would just include everyone</font>

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,190
else in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so basically the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,010
gist of this talk is that there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

22
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,929
formulaic way of approaching security<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,369
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> will ever do it</font>

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,140
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a little bit</font>

25
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,540
of the historical things that we've done

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,750
to secure items<font color="#E5E5E5"> right infrastructure etc</font>

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,909
and why no one has done those<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to talk about some of the</font>

29
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,280
future things that we could be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

30
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to and we're basically</font>

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
going to be focusing and using we need

32
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,030
to poo<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout and sometimes any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pork</font>

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">so if you're familiar with the Soviet</font>

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,670
system there's actually a clone of

35
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">winnie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pooh so are like gentle</font>

stroll through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hundred Acre</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Woods</font>

37
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,650
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give a quick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overview</font>

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,030
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean when I talk about</font>

39
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,829
security right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's slightly</font>

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,420
different than what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that several other</font>

41
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,960
people mean when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when discussing</font>

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,270
this

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about like process failures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

44
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,780
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the sorts of things that</font>

45
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,930
businesses do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not necessarily like</font>

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,180
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mist 853 style process failure</font>

47
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a like a general issue</font>

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,390
that we have with the way that we design

49
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,439
and implement systems

50
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about some cryptographic</font>

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,610
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it'll basically can</font>

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,229
compare and contrast where we were with

53
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">x509 services like sdk i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk a</font>

54
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,300
little bit about operating systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

55
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">unix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

56
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,150
why that's awful for the rest of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was originally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to include</font>

58
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,010
frameworks but as on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 75 slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> already I figured that i probably</font>

60
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">will bore you to death by the end of</font>

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,210
like 50<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I cut that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole section</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,760
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll talk a little bit</font>

63
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network protocols</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why they're</font>

64
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,609
broken

65
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,470
why they will basically never get better

66
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,850
and we'll talk about programming

67
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,740
language theory which is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

68
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">extremely interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and then we'll</font>

69
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,430
talk a little bit about a thought

70
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,519
experiment that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been been working</font>

71
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:49,990
on myself for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know about 10</font>

72
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,730
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my talks have themes so</font>

73
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,460
you were just unfortunate enough to end

74
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,109
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> winnie the pooh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> themed one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I also</font>

75
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,030
have a talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on programming language</font>

76
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,060
theory that actually uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shakespeare</font>

77
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">but you know all of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

78
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,330
some theme and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to hit</font>

79
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

80
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,490
don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the absence of</font>

81
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,730
vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a</font>

82
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,230
whole whole process<font color="#E5E5E5"> here i'm talking</font>

83
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,359
about design<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the</font>

84
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">deputation or what the actual system</font>

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,030
means itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about models of</font>

86
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,590
security that we can actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

87
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> centralization of</font>

88
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,190
those controls of security controls that

89
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,930
we can have right so you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

90
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,940
talk about input validation or you're

91
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,020
talking about ingress filtering<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

92
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,550
to have those in a single location

93
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,170
instead of spread out throughout your

94
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,770
entire application or throughout your

95
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,019
entire infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking</font>

96
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,770
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralized implementation</font>

97
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,500
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you think about like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x509</font>

98
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">services spk I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about the</font>

99
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,430
various various ways that we can

100
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,070
implement things you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

101
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,790
differences in how<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has control what</font>

102
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust train is etc and we'll talk</font>

103
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,040
about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually mean when I talk</font>

104
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,870
about secure so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,700
thinking about security<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

106
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,500
formula right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all those</font>

107
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,238
things together<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that most</font>

108
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,570
people are not normally used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> r2</font>

109
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">deputation specifically dedication of</font>

110
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,839
semantics of what your application

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,360
actually means or what your what your

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,109
network actually means is the first

113
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,710
thing that most people are not aware

114
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,949
so when you have this sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when</font>

115
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,628
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deputation or set of</font>

116
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:34,759
semantics for an application you can

117
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:37,879
actually understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> at any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given point</font>

118
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">what is or is not valid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics for</font>

119
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,060
your program<font color="#CCCCCC"> now where is this actually</font>

120
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,349
interesting for us right

121
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,360
well you could have something like a

122
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:48,919
state machine parsing bug in<font color="#CCCCCC"> openssl</font>

123
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation right so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should know</font>

124
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,609
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state transfers for your your</font>

125
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,139
protocol but you don't actually know

126
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,539
them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a way to actually</font>

127
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,710
insert yourself into a different area in

128
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,779
the state machine logic you have

129
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,878
different semantics at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

130
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,250

language three purposes as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

132
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,939
basically what we're looking for is

133
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,270
something that describes the structure

134
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:13,250
and the flow of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a program of a a</font>

network infrastructure protocol as we go

136
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:19,039
through and we have some formal rules

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:23,419
about those<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thing is modeling</font>

138
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,610
you know most people have probably seen

139
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,948
the lower part of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is obviously</font>

140
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">Java</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the upper part is something</font>

141
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,460
that most people are not aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

142
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,379
this is actually called<font color="#CCCCCC"> jml</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,448

144
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's designing for its setting up a</font>

specific set of contracts that your

146
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:41,990
application actually has to validate and

147
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">verify prior to not even execution but</font>

148
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,949
compilation<font color="#CCCCCC"> so basically this is just</font>

149
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:48,889
saying that at any given state in the

150

program<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to require that the</font>

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:58,789
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when we're doing this here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that the internal side of balance</font>

161
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,710
more people would have it the other fun

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">one is that they've defined all these</font>

things they did them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have it they</font>

164
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,250
have some system that actually goes

168
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,680
the rest of the application and no one

169
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,870
actually cares that there's all these

170
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">process values throughout the entire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

172
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,219
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think are the most</font>

173
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,120
interesting

174
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,560
now why do we actually

175
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,020
care about these sorts of things right

176
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,669
well we care because we're actually

177
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,130
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just security but we're</font>

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,599
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctness</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

it's supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font>

182
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,330
have a little bit of a heresy here right

183
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">I actually think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could design</font>

184
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:02,150
something to be unhackable

185
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you</font>

186
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,770
could come up with something that if you

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,199
through tons of money at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you spent</font>

190
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,620
allowed anyone to stop the process at

any<font color="#E5E5E5"> given point in order to have a</font>

now<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you actually need to do this for</font>

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,919
the vast majority of your infrastructure

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">right that it has anyone actually done a</font>

technically my boss is laughing at me in

201
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,619
the entire time because that's one of

202
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:44,630
the services that we offer but it's

203
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,250
honestly outside most people's budgets

204
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,810
right you don't need to have these sorts

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search practices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

to invest that sort of time that sort of

212

effort into it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought we'd start</font>

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,180
actually get wrong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're</font>

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,650
usually surprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones right we all</font>

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,530
think that we communicate really well

218
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,960
and we think that we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk really well</font>

219
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">we think that we express our ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

that they've ever given you<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">clear very common and as a developer</font>

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,958
we as<font color="#E5E5E5"> devs and we as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are both</font>

of the product that they give out they

that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send piglet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

about these things the way that we

empower them in a way that they can

actually implement something useful

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,110
means that we will just continue to have

you'll be ripped on by your dev<font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

they actually haven't you know they

interesting properties which I'll get to

in a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so does anyone know</font>

it you get without actually having an

375
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,689
to try to explain to someone quickly and

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:23,290
correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to validate a certificate</font>

chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially if it includes is right</font>

378
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,160
and then you also have to think about

379
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,449
the fact that you're trusting a large

380

number of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you're no longer</font>

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this clearly has some problems right</font>

387
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,229
it's not it's non-trivial we can all

388
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,639
think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SL parts in bugs we can all</font>

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,829
think of issues that we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

certificates deploying them<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintaining</font>

391
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:55,029
them etc so we have this other system

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,310
right this is great this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

later<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm literally everyone in the room</font>

394
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,779
can look at this and figure out roughly

395
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,949
how to parse this certificate right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

403
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,970
that you can actually encode access

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,850
set the stack up because the the

507
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,669

not really interested in doing this sort

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,170
really fancy a<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system we don't need</font>

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,520
a lot about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oils whole thing we need</font>

544
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,810
something really simple that's really

545
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,940
easy to deploy on the on the

546
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,500
infrastructure that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we</font>

547
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,170
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we can we can take</font>

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can pour it all over the place you</font>

549
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:53,030
know super simple for us to do and we'll

550
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,100
worry about the details later<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

551
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,960
it was written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> c you know there's</font>

552
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,149
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bootstrap for assembly there</font>

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">but see itself is pretty low level</font>

554
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,130
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> k NRC training</font>

555
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Richie see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very close to like</font>

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:12,020
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> mapping directly to the to the</font>

557
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:14,960
assembly as well so you know we're just

558
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,550
now in this in this day and age<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

559
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,920
just now getting back to where we were

560
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,659
in 1964 we're just now starting to talk

561
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,220
about operating systems that are written

562
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,840
in higher-level languages

563
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll actually get into that a little bit</font>

564
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,909
later found and<font color="#CCCCCC"> NEC else for everything</font>

565
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,530
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of selinux think of the</font>

566
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,320
various other control systems that we

567
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,700
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to have</font>

568
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,800
these sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had them in</font>

569
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,360
1964<font color="#E5E5E5"> we gave them up because it didn't</font>

570
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,899
actually you know it wasn't

571
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost-effective for us we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had a</font>

572
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,200
specification so multics was actually

573
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,908
very heavily specified in the beginning

574
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,409
it was very

575
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:53,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a very clear defined very close</font>

cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual way of working through the</font>

577
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:57,590
entire system and had true process

00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:59,149
separation<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time when most things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not really concerned about it right</font>

580
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:04,399
think about how many years we went with

581
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:06,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 86</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based processors that didn't</font>

have actual process separation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

583
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:13,460
tried to fix these things right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I x</font>

actually ironic about this was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

actually infected with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Morris worm</font>

597
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:42,978
and it delayed the release of IX for a

decent amount of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we also</font>

all the exact same issues and we also

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get we can get</font>

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,549
easier to describe what sort of data

things very quickly and very easily in

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,700
very little to do with protocols unless

all

implementation details right<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

741
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">great</font>

742
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,620
because it makes it really simple to get

743
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,390
started but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's painful because it's</font>

744
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,709
extremely difficult to program security

745
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that's why we have these entire</font>

746
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,290
bloated stacks that we end up using

747

everywhere

748
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,379
the other thing is to think about how

749
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,870
many different authentication systems

750
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,420
are built into one web server right

751
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,879
you at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least have basic off and</font>

754
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,850
ways of implementing it you can have

forth and we build applications on top

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,730
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and then we wonder why</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's actual issues there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:32,730
fix any of these issues here we can we

775
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,980
you know we can try to replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core</font>

with something that's actually stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

780
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,070
what we basically end up doing is we're

781
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,570
taking all these other older protocols

782
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,760
that may have fixed certain things we

783
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,570
just stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> them into HTTP and then we</font>

784
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,890
wonder why we have vulnerabilities

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:59,460
afterwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so just be or just go</font>

816
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">right we've eliminated all those things</font>

817
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,570
in the roughly 60 to 70 years since

818
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,130
we've been doing this sort of thing you

819
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,919
know and even even when you think about

820
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,240
the the first the first garbage

<font color="#E5E5E5">lift one of the first things that they</font>

noticed about<font color="#E5E5E5"> list was that it was</font>

really easy to deny access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

829
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,629
we've had these sorts of issues we've

never dealt with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the beginning was</font>

that we knew about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've actually</font>

833
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:53,350
studied buffer overflows<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an area of</font>

study since 1972<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and we're still</font>

dealing with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially dealing in</font>

836
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,770
the embedded space you'll still see the

00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">point is that when you have these</font>

845
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,320
super interesting one is that came out

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,540
recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> was this android</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> compiler</font>

847
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,490
fingerprinting and why it's interesting

848
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,899
to me is the way that different

849
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,840
compilers actually implement different

850
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,400
semantics for<font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Java allows you to</font>

851
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,860
figure out what the original developer

854
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,230
right we're using more modern languages

855
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're using stuff from the seventies and</font>

eighties now instead of from the fifties

857

and sixties

a bunch of stuff from the seventies is

864
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:01,140
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably one of the newer</font>

00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:03,210
languages on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's still</font>

866
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,760
just making sure that everyone plays

nicely as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talking together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> riding these new languages and</font>

870
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,730
we're not necessarily looking at what

00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:14,010
the core of what we're doing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

could understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font>

about the level program that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:31,380
understand and describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I want I want</font>

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">an array right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to initialize that</font>

879

00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,820
character value<font color="#E5E5E5"> modularly right so you</font>

881
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:42,870
know we go through three AZ and then

882
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,789
loop back around<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i want to</font>

883
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,770
make sure that every every<font color="#E5E5E5"> access of</font>

884
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:55,169
that vector is actually in there

885
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:56,700
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone spot the bug right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly so</font>

886
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:01,080
we actually overflow here by accident

887
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:03,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's super simple</font>

888
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something really easy to</font>

889
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,929
do how many times have you actually done

890
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,389
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like the hardest things in</font>

891
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:11,668
computer science<font color="#CCCCCC"> our art at naming</font>

892
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,409
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking the correct algorithm and</font>

893
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,480
off by one errors right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there's</font>

00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,240
only two hard things in computer science

895
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,250
so you know that's why we come up with

896
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,618
these fancy new languages right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font>

897
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,480
this is rust here if you haven't seen

<font color="#CCCCCC">grading whore has been working on it's</font>

900
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,700
pretty interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff they have some</font>

901
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:32,520
interesting things going on here

00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm so i implemented the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

903
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,790
here right and we come up with something

904
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,739
really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

905
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:41,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm explicitly telling the compiler that</font>

906
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:44,158
not only is this safe to consume as an

907
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:46,259
8-bit integer<font color="#CCCCCC"> but afterwards that entire</font>

910
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:54,610
this actually compiles and runs

911
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,080
or sort of but it compiles right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

912
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,850
we're hoping that a language that would

00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,529
require this level like discipline and

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,670
one of the first things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font>

921
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,810
ran into when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying rust was that</font>

922
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,310
i was looking at all these really cool

923
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,140
new management techniques and then I

924
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">realized that I was not still handling</font>

925
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,799
the lower level issues that you would

926
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,620
run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously I saw something a</font>

927
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,790
little bit less trivial but it was still

928
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:32,680
in this similar vein<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safe for</font>

929
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,420
languages<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can still hit these sorts</font>

930
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,919
of issues we can't escape them but we're

931
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,510
hoping that the the compiler will

932
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,100
actually give us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour the language</font>

933
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,020
itself will actually help us to move

934
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,850
beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> these sorts of things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rust</font>

935
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,170
itself does right

936
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">I wanted to fix it because I didn't want</font>

937
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,740
to be one of those guys who comes up

938
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,569
here and and you know shits on something

939
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,279
and then doesn't actually provide the

940
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,740
way of fixing it so there are ways of

941
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,840
there are ways of actually fixing the

942
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,520
issue that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're fairly</font>

943
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,740
trivial but the language doesn't

944
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,570
actually save you from doing it just yet

945
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,759
we want languages to save us from

946
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:08,110
causing vulnerabilities

947
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,420
that's my name at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I</font>

948
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,560
look for in<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I'm assessing some new</font>

00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented whole new features right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1055
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:02,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">ended up with something that was</font>

1056
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,279
extremely small<font color="#E5E5E5"> and correct</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus</font>

1057
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,809
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was broader and probably</font>

1058
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,789
would have been better for what other

1059
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:09,529
people were looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> because i had to</font>

1060
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:12,410
invest so much time and actually proving

1061
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:14,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the right thing so I thought</font>

1062
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,029
we'd actually do a thought experiment

1063
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is 1 i've been running for like ten</font>

1064
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:21,619
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> release code this time</font>

1065
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:23,359
this is a big complaint with me is that

1066
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to sit on things academically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1067
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,038
know you're all surprised that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm i can</font>

1068
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:31,789
be academic<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought I would do a</font>

1069
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:33,140
thought experiment here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

1070
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:34,700
thinking about like<font color="#CCCCCC"> well what would I</font>

1071
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,450
actually do if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to improve these</font>

1072
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:42,980
things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually attempted</font>

1073
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:45,169
this before so I had a programming

1074
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,319
language called<font color="#CCCCCC"> gamma by gamma</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

1075
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:52,430
extended version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme and it</font>

1076
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:55,069
included some ways of actually modifying

1077
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,720
the execution<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such that if</font>

1078
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:00,049
you were given an arbitrary piece of

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,118
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> language level could</font>

1080
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:03,829
not escape the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox that you had</font>

1081
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,990
defined for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you still</font>

1082
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:09,079
have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> define a properly secure</font>

1083
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:10,729
sandbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could prove</font>

1084
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:13,400
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox that you had written</font>

1085
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">with actually accurate and actually did</font>

1086
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,700
what you were expecting it to do right

1087
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,519
so it had a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colonel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

1088
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,629
small and formally verified<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I took</font>

1089
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,640
all those ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> I through the morning</font>

1090
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">I took 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> character and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> toss them out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i started working</font>

1092
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:29,008
on another language is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one will</font>

1093
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally work out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caramel and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Carl I've actually added in for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logic</font>

1095
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,700
which is a way of doing the formal

1096
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:37,680
modeling that we had we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had talked about</font>

1097
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,169
there with a little bit of a nicer

1098
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,848
easier more approachable syntax and

1099
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,099
there's some ideas from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from memory</font>

1100
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:45,690
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rust in there as well and</font>

1101
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,299
it's very similar to a programming

1102
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,859
language called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yeti i know that i'm</font>

1103
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:52,559
picking all the mainstream languages

1104
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:54,509
here for this talk but yet he is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ml</font>

1105
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,660
dialect for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has some</font>

1106
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:59,039
interesting properties as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font>

1107
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a caramel itself is actually</font>

1108
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,380
basically at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i said</font>

1109
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:07,920
nicer syntax<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't say nice syntax</font>

1110
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">but basically we can define certain</font>

1111
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,609
properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program and not only can</font>

1112
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:14,400
we pattern match on types and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font>

1113
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:16,740
but we can also use guards<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use</font>

1114
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,180
some extensions there to actually prove

1115
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,089
that our program is doing the correct

1116
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:24,210
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's it's been an</font>

1117
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:26,819
interesting ride for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm about</font>

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">75% done with the parsing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

1119
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:31,500
interested in doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> also the language</font>

1120
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,200
itself is roughly laid out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has some</font>

1121
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,759
rough semantics behind it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have</font>

1122
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,930
some examples that we were I've already

1123
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:38,579
been working on

1124
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a prototypical compiler</font>

00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not released it didn't completely</font>

1126
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">solve myself of that problem with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1127
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:49,410
releasing code<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's basically</font>

1128
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,109
getting to the point where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was happy</font>

1129
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:54,180
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> die</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gammon and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Typhon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which it was</font>

1130

the verified virtual machine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that i had been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um so</font>

1133
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:03,508
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is my attempt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at solving</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the issues that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i pointed out in in the</font>

00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:11,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably never get done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll find some</font>

1137
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,569
other new shiny or something else to pay

1138
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:17,430
me that that all be better<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for now</font>

1139
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:18,808
this is my current experiment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

1140
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">can follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> along and get help if you</font>

1141
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:21,539
want

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been playing</font>

1143
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:28,980
with is a protocol called<font color="#E5E5E5"> WhistlePig at</font>

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">whistle pig is so named because my</font>

girlfriend<font color="#CCCCCC"> hurt hates this word whenever</font>

1146
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:35,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say it but basically it's a</font>

1147
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:38,160
combination of gopher

1148
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:43,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">and 9 p-9 p is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file system . a</font>

protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> that backpacks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan9</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan9</font>

1150
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:46,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">had this file system protocol that you</font>

1151
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">could use and it was basically used for</font>

1152
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,630
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> so once the colonel had</font>

1153
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,150
started everything including networking

1154
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:57,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">was based off of this this file system</font>

1155
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:00,390
protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so whistle pig has some</font>

1156
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:02,039
ideas from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

1157
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,680
how keys and certificates are

1158
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:09,479
implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am using spk I for this</font>

1159
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:11,249
from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start and the basic</font>

1160
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:13,348
specification for<font color="#CCCCCC"> WhistlePig itself is</font>

1161
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:15,058
actually up on github as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1162
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:16,890
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be better and actually release</font>

1163
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:20,309
things and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> my kids laughing at me</font>

1164
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:22,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">but basically this time around i thought</font>

1165
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would try an experiment differently</font>

1166
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:25,170
and actually release things and see what

1167
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">else what else</font>

1168
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:30,089
people can actually come up with based

1169
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:32,249
off of what i've been doing up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1170
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:34,440
actually done and getting close to the

1171
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:36,029
end there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought I would</font>

1172
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,839
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> smiles what you should be getting</font>

1173
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:39,390
out of this

1174
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:40,589
so nothing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've talked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

1175
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,319
save<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1176
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:44,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all left to our own</font>

1177
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:49,920
devices to actually get out there

1178
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no meaning to security</font>

1179
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,489
you're all probably going to get hacked

1180
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,959
at some point even if it just means that

1181
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:58,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">your hacked by some guy walking out with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the entire stack of papers there we all</font>

1183
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:01,859
die

1184
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,189
you know there's there's no way of

1185
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:07,229
getting around that sadly it and also

1186
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,880
like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is not going to be</font>

1187
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:10,948
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

1188
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,539
so even if you do all these sorts of

1189
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:14,579
things even if you go out and implement

1190
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:17,670
an entire formally verified process

1191
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:21,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'd still have all the same sorts of</font>

1192
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,769
problems that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

1193
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:24,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">just be different ones and more painful</font>

1194
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:25,769
ones because you'd also be fighting with

1195
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,229
the compiler to prove that you actually

1196
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:29,339
know what you're talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1197
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:31,348
the end of the day at least you would

1198
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:32,640
have a really nice pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph that</font>

1199
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">would show that you had actually done</font>

1200
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,190
all this work there<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

1201
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">does anyone have questions for us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1202
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:58,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so my problem with academia is</font>

1203
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">twofold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually used to</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed about academia is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1207
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're not chasing the hot thing that</font>

1208
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:15,420
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisor is chasing you may as well</font>

1209
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:17,370
not exist right now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like yeah</font>

1210
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,810
we have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> heads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not</font>

1211
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:20,580
you're not going to you're not gonna get

1214
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times getting peer review</font>

1215
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other thing is actually peer review</font>

1216
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">so because of the nature of academia</font>

1217
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">right if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to send a paper to Mike</font>

1218
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,450
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike is working in the same realm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1219
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,950
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to trust that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1220
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,210
going to see something make some

1221
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:41,189
connection to something that he's

1222
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:43,350
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then run off and actually</font>

1223
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,210
fix a problem I've been having<font color="#CCCCCC"> so Mike</font>

1224
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:47,009
may fix something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm having a different</font>

1225
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:49,980
problem and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I exchange papers for</font>

1226
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:52,620
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> the review there's that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1227
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is to academia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not tend</font>

1228
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,180
to have a very short shelf life<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

1229
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,770
you work in academia you do something

1230
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,440
interesting and then the rest of your

1231
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:03,840
career you're chasing that publishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi</font>

1232
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,400
so you're you're trying to to make sure

1233
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,230
that your paper mill is coming out that

1234
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,050
you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> cited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're being cited</font>

1235
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:13,020
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're collaborating you're chasing</font>

1236
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:16,620
grants<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it can it can be very painful</font>

1237
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to actually try to keep up with it</font>

1238
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,009
have there been fixes to these sorts of

1239
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,779
things yes

1240
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,690
now the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with academia is</font>

1241
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,750
very that often that<font color="#CCCCCC"> its academic so</font>

1242
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:30,390
they don't necessarily have to be

1243
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,890
focused on being performance on being

1244
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,020
you know something that you could

1245
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,089
release<font color="#CCCCCC"> or use so it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have this</font>

1246
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,700
one box<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> designed an operating</font>

1247
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:41,400
system for it it literally can only run

1248
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,770
on this box<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea how to put</font>

1249
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,180
this off of this box<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know one of</font>

1250
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:47,470
my grad students actually wrote the

1251
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:51,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">bootloader and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot</font>

1252
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:53,500
so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we totally can do</font>

1253
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,780
these sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we just want</font>

1254
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so does that answer your question</font>

1255
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:01,300
on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm realistic about that as well</font>

1256
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:04,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else have any other questions</font>

1257
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">truck and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 i'm sorry</font>

1258
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm actually extremely hard of hearing</font>

1259
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,839
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miss hear what you say it's it's</font>

1260
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,660
not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care it's because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1261
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't hear and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care but no</font>

1262
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:31,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">please what we're going to set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1263
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,290
presume<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've actually program data</font>

1264
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,599
right

1265
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so we have 12 people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room</font>

1266
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:38,500
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll include myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as anyone</font>

1267
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:42,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">else actually program data before</font>

1268
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok we have three people in the firm has</font>

1269
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:46,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyone program that was it larger was in</font>

1270
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:49,599
college

1271
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so and was yours yours was</font>

1272
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:56,800
like at<font color="#E5E5E5"> an actual product or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so I've</font>

1273
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:59,890
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did one stint on a native</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

1274
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok it was miserable it was extremely</font>

1275
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,240
difficult to get the compiler to do half

1276
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,460
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right i</font>

1277
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,890
was i was actually tasked with making

1278
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,869
sure that the rc4<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm was</font>

1279
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:14,319
implemented correctly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some subsystem</font>

1280
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:16,810
when we were working on and I just

1281
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,960
remember wanting to cry

1282
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,730
mostly mostly crime<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah I was it</font>

1283
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,410
was pretty bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is great it has</font>

1284
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the stuff that we that we would</font>

1285
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,618
be solved things like spark and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raven</font>

1286
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,720
scar

1287
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:32,530
those are really great subsets of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ADA</font>

1288
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,660
itself so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can define smaller portions</font>

1291
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,730
there's some great areas that you can do

00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">i I just every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time I've worked with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

1293
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,680
been more painful than anything else

1294
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's also probably the language i would</font>

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">look to compare anything else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

1296
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,990
so if you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can't solve what</font>

1297
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:58,510
ADA has solved for us since<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1983 at</font>

1298

least<font color="#E5E5E5"> 83 85</font>

if you can't solve those sorts of things

<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have program data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>
