2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,800
best security conferences around<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk about that but this all</font>

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,129
started with an idea and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,960
the concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we were going to</font>

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,519
make an automotive certificate program

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">at walsh college and that's where i</font>

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,829
offensive and what the way we go about

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,270
it is that were including people from

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,020
different parts of the automotive

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,689

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,829
bit out of place you know I feel a

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,740
little more comfortable in this type of

37
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,110
environment with people like myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,000
that's where this kind of came from so

39
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,679
we're talking about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture crash</font>

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,090
and there's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things that I</font>

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,669
possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> linking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and join the forces</font>

know because that's one of the things

76
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,670
that you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security arena</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

77
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,799
often get sold as<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know</font>

78
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,958
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna cost is actually you know</font>

79
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">it gotta you know there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-offs</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">should we eliminate this or should we</font>

81
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,940
just accept the rest we just keep on

82
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,670
moving forward on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions</font>

83
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but what we have to</font>

84
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,750
do here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a step back and</font>

85
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,260
basically what we have to do is try to

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,389
our best to define culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and through</font>

87
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,500
this cut through this conversation

88
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,239
through this presentation we're going to

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,340
talk about stereotypes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the similarities</font>

90
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,730
we have between people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and corporate</font>

91
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,290
culture and people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trick</font>

92
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,910
traditional hackers people that actually

93
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,590
work in their own workplaces set up

94
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,769
their own different boxes and try to

95
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,228
attack those boxes to try to better our

96
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,910
own understanding of security

97
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,769
what are some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> countermeasures and</font>

98
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,800
the cultural clashes that go with that

99
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,080
and hopefully we're going to look at the

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,819
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> study</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz i also believe a lot</font>

101
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,878
in history and we don't want to repeat

102
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,979
that so that's the kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> caucus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

103
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very techincal from that</font>

104
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,090
standpoint but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're</font>

105
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">expecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a more technical talk then you</font>

106
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,539
might want to go to something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

107
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:41,639
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more technical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but so about</font>

108
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:44,188
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have 18</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years of experience and</font>

109
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,319
operational security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked mainly</font>

110
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:48,270
at a college level and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was one of the</font>

111
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,710
guys that they kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> look to when they</font>

112
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,349
had security breaches and stuff like

113
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,000
that and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well how did this get</font>

114
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:55,949
out and I would do a quick google search

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,289
and I find like document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some idiot</font>

123
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:17,340
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was trying to build a program that</font>

out and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to define culture and</font>

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,940
then basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass and they</font>

probably one of the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that we</font>

can define culture and its culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,008
the consistence of derivatives of

175
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,659
argue about this all day so we class

really realize it until<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a former</font>

182
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">for formal education and then I started</font>

183
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,840
realizing like hey wait a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

184
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,030
actually like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm testing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

all the way over to websites and stuff

188
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,200
like that and then I started to realize

189
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,729
some of the folly of my ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> the black</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hat actually represents more of the</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge one which is basically should we</font>

go ahead and have open source for

automotive vehicles<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus the closed</font>

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,140
more the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus the corporations</font>

209
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,669
that have very strict boundaries of what

you can and cannot do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you will</font>

212
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,400
a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's the communication</font>

213
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,958
response

214
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,910
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hacker tools that are out</font>

215
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,229
there that are different<font color="#CCCCCC"> that obviously</font>

216
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,689
the corporation has a lot more money

217
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,910
spent on tools where we develop our own

218
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,530
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

219
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to various websites to make them</font>

220
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,400
available for people that wanna play

00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,349
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> testing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">perfect concepts and legality concerns</font>

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,290
and ethics<font color="#CCCCCC"> so cultural crash number one</font>

224
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:08,610
so it's the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus the hacker</font>

225
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:11,370
culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this is a this is a</font>

screenshot of what people think about

227
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,230
hackers in general we don't all wear

228
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,520
hoodies<font color="#CCCCCC"> first and foremost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is</font>

229
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,720
the stuff that they put out there you

230
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,020
guys all know this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's</font>

231
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a little bit there's ads and</font>

232
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,460
stuff like that long ways as you know

233
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,020
how hackers and her makers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of battling</font>

234
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,060
for control of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ride</font>

235
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,590
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the average user reads this</font>

236
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,479
they think that you're trying to break

237
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,100
into their car and that's not

238
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
necessarily true for the most part and

239
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we're just interested in like</font>

240
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,870
trying to figure out we might want to

241
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,610
plug into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> can bus of the vehicle it</font>

242
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,530
might be your own vehicle<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to see</font>

243
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,930
what we can do what we can make work

244
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we can't work for makers and from</font>

245
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,050
that sense i mean that's that's what we

246
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,980
do

247
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:56,520
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> does immediate to portray the at the</font>

248
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,980
culture of the hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> like is being bad</font>

249
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,780
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they also portrayed the</font>

250
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">corporation's is being bad as well</font>

251
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in their</font>

vehicles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can find different</font>

253
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:13,890
types of you know different types of

254
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:17,520
examples for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so Henry Ford</font>

255
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,680
basically he's he's one of our original

256
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,170
hackers and he's from around at the

257
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">unitarian metropolitan area so we all</font>

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,280
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much we grew up around</font>

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,230
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he talked about failure is</font>

260
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,839
simply the opportunity to begin again

261
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,400
this time were intelligently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

262
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,230
the way we all have to approach it from

263
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,439

266
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,360
actually a good thing because now you

know it exists now you know there might

268
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,210
be something that you have to address at

<font color="#CCCCCC">parents else off with the corporate</font>

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,560
them and in a constructive way<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

349
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,280
the hacker community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason why</font>

350
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,010
this is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same in cars as</font>

351
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,110
it is in any server or operating system

352
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,340
that's out there is because we just want

353
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,250
to see it fixed

354
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and the reason why we like go ahead</font>

355
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,660
and we just go put things out there and

356
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,459
to the public and we say okay well

357
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,870
here's here's the vulnerability is

358
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,089
because it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fire</font>

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,889
he finally came out and said look we

00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:02,490
happened we<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to be you know in the</font>

372

decided not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit you know they decided</font>

probably getting paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good for it</font>

that perception is something that we all

401

make up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is like psychological</font>

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you know a lot but but anyway on</font>

437
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,399
that they want to put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why</font>

438
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">I say that is because they want to put</font>

439
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,659
constraints around the hackers member

440
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,520
unbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't like boundaries so when</font>

441
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:47,070
you try to put its constraints around us

442
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,320
corporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> then basically what happens is</font>

443
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,899
you really turn us off<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't wanna be</font>

444
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,490
like held liable for something that we

445
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,140
want to disclose to you to try to fix

446
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,880
your product because you probably should

447
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,460
have thought about in the first place

448
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,250
what we want to do is basically go ahead

449
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,090
and you know help you out and just get

450
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,649
it fixed

451
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,689
you know that's that's the that's the

452
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:08,039
mentality on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know there's a</font>

453
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,750
certain pride and it depends on the

454
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">person's depends on the motivation it</font>

455
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,590
might actually be like hey look<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

456
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,658
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was me that actually found this</font>

457
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,639
problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually they fix that</font>

458
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think that's where the pride really is</font>

459
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,169
with the hacker community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

460
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what's got to stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we can</font>

461
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:27,450
definitely go ahead and make you know

462
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:30,450
build bridges<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in terms of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,100
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also understand the legality</font>

464
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,070
side of the corporation that they don't

465
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,799
want to be held liable<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm for something</font>

466
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,899
that might actually cause death or harm

467
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">i got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows already have teams of</font>

469
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,590
full-time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when somebody talks</font>

470
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:52,470
to media corporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> area versus hackers</font>

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the message gets edited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

472
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:58,740
i actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you know I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> channel</font>

473
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,659
50<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a street beat this this</font>

474
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,629
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

475
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,820
hackers in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked about some</font>

476
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:07,799
of the security concerns we have on

477
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,450
that's a different topic as far as

478
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:12,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation-state and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we have to be more</font>

479
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,739
aware of but in those conversations like

480
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,539
you know you have to meet you realize

481
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:17,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sometimes when you say stuff on TV</font>

482
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and media</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and for those of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

483
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:22,379
actually been<font color="#E5E5E5"> media</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> train</font>

484
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,359
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they might get edited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or cut</font>

485
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,529
down and then also it doesn't it doesn't

486
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,178
sound right

487
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:29,759
so you have to realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens to</font>

488
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,470
corporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this place a lot</font>

489
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,619
into the perception of overall public

490
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">and as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so media is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of like one</font>

491
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,658
of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like I don't</font>

492
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:43,200
necessarily believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

493
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:45,269
see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the point of</font>

494
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,710
that slide but you know that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

495
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,929
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you better to take it</font>

496
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,369
back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit to the person</font>

497
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,769

clarification if you don't agree with it

500
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,509

501
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,239
conference is like everybody here like

the hackers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corporation obviously</font>

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall and you know and think maybe</font>

648
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,990
that's a strategy that the corporation

649
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:21,049
likes to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe that's why</font>

650
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:24,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're not so big on open source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

the BMW<font color="#E5E5E5"> a corporation and he said that</font>

717
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey these these vulnerabilities are in</font>

about it so he sat on it for months and

722
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:17,070
nothing ever happened from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font>

723
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about how to fix that</font>

724
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,659
hopefully if there's not any corporate

725
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,970
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk out already but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm all</font>

be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds like a fantasy</font>

728
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,130
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are companies that are</font>

and creativity is going on and people

736
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,860
are learning how to work with the

737

738
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,699
systems and actually how to break and

739
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,890
fix them more innovations from third

740
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,780
parties that's what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

741
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,210
good thing that there are smaller

00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">alliances that are out there and</font>

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> major automotive players are</font>

744
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,400
part of those alliances salt and we're

745
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,680
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ford and GM and stuff like</font>

746
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,810
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> artists as there is an</font>

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,810
shift your paradigm a little bit

00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:24,419
it's not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's totally closed like</font>

752
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:26,040
we think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there they are sharing</font>

a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's another reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

also something that could have a

limitation if you're looking for

808
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,439

on this creates a struggle both legally

<font color="#CCCCCC">and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those people actually had to</font>

go on before<font color="#CCCCCC"> capitol hill and defend</font>

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">what Charlie Miller did because because</font>

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,240
it was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> perceived as</font>

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">on and so there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that legal struggle on</font>

well where do you think they get these

840
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,600
ideas from when they see stuff like this

841
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that lone gunman tality</font>

842
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,030
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also if it wasn't done</font>

843
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:38,180
who would ever take it as a big

844
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:41,149
perceivable threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's that other</font>

845
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,030
side of the coin and it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

846
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,910

847
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,370
this is my humble opinion is that we're

848
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting pushed into the corner of making</font>

849
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,239
these horrible decisions because

850
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:58,940
nobody's going to listen to us unless we

851
00:32:53,240 --> 00:33:01,340
actually do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so more solutions to</font>

852
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,580
demand respect you must need you must

853
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,470
gain respect and in the corporate

854
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:11,179
culture that's definitely more true than

855
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:12,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it pays to be professional when</font>

00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,540
you're dealing with these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

the hacker culture the hacker culture

872
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,810
also needs and wants that communication

875
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:57,200
that if they were communicated to think

876
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,550
about this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your corporation and</font>

890
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:29,779
tell them all the all the details but at

891
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,810
least communicate to the hacker

892
